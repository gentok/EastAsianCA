Title = {Modeling of water management for cotton production in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {265},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Cotton is the main crop in Uzbekistan. The use of water for irrigation
   of cotton has a number of environmental consequences, most notably the
   decreasing of the Aral Sea, and triggering water salinity increase.
   Modeling of water management for cotton production in the cotton
   agro-eco zones of Uzbekistan is a challenge constrained by the
   availability and salinity of water. This research presents a system
   dynamics model of water management for cotton production in Uzbekistan.
   Causal loop diagram and stock flow diagram are hypothesized to generate
   the observed behavior of cotton production system. The model was
   programmed using the software STELLA and was solved using Runge-Kutta
   forth order method. Simulated results agree well with the observed data
   of cotton area and total cotton production quantitatively. Sensitivity
   analysis of the model have also been addressed. Also the model has been
   simulated to address the policy issue of investment on drip irrigation,
   cotton price liberalization, improvement in crop productivity and a mix
   policy which is combination of these three policies. Finally, the model
   provides better understanding and greater insights for water management
   of cotton production for better management of cotton production and can
   be used as a computer laboratory for scenario building and policy
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Muslim women's leadership cannot be reduced to its social manifestations
   and formation. While analyzing a case study of leadership provided by
   some Muslim women in Uzbekistan, a post-Soviet Central Asian country,
   the author demonstrates that this leadership is essentially personal,
   propelled from within individuals and driven by their motivations. At
   the same time, Muslim women's leadership is relational conceptualized
   and enacted always in relation to someone or something, including the
   self. By highlighting the importance of individual experiences, this
   article highlights the personal-relational dynamic and calls for an
   analytical reassessment of the role of the human body beyond its
   expected use in cultivating certain dispositions and sensibilities in
   the debates about Muslim women's leadership. As a venue for a more
   detailed understanding of existing forms of leadership among Muslim
   women, this dynamic helps us better comprehend human leadership in

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between constitutional design and

   constitutions shape patterns of corruption, particularly with regard to

   systems of former leaders Akaev and Bakiev the organization of public
   corruption took a monopolistic order, concentrated primarily around the
   presidential families. The constitutional changes of 2010 curbed
   presidential powers and introduced an empowered legislature. This led
   corruption to gravitate from the executive to political parties.
   Consequently, corruption has become more dispersed and competitive while
   concomitantly requiring brittle coalition deals to be made in order to
   handle the allocation of profitable public offices.},

Abstract = {This article examines the changes that have taken place since the

   changes have had for Kyrgyzstani NGOs. It uses two-stage longitudinal
   research. The findings reveal that donors changed their priorities after
   the mid-2000s by closing the civil society building programmes and
   grants they initiated in the 1990s. Donors now prioritize promoting NGOs
   in advocacy roles for policy reform. Interviewed NGOs reported that
   donor grants had decreased, aggravating the existing competition for
   donor funding among NGOs. This article suggests that as a result of
   these changes NGOs that are organizationally and professionally stronger
   are in a better position to obtain funding and, thus, continue their
   work. The research findings also indicate that some NGOs expanded their
   funding sources between 2008 and 2016.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {837-862},
Abstract = {This paper scrutinises the translation of sovereignty into daily actions
   at the border. The Soviet Union established a heavily securitised and
   sealed border, which was perpetuated in post-Soviet, civil war-stricken
   Tajikistan by assigning the task to the Russian Federation's border
   forces. After having taken over the task of guarding the border, the
   slowly recovering post-conflict state tried hard to maintain its own
   border control. Drawing on interviews with borderland people, this
   article discusses the convergence of Tajikistan's strong claim but weak
   support for sovereignty, with the daily life of the borderland people.
   It will show how - given the Pamirs' special status as a border district
   - far-reaching sovereign authority of state agents, aiming to provide
   security at the border, has been translated into arbitrary actions
   ensuring individual benefits and has been hidden by intransparency. The
   article argues that the lack of adequate support from the central
   government encourages state representatives at the border to reinterpret
   the sovereign power assigned to them in order to serve their own
   individual benefits and purposes. Instead of being used to maintain the
   state territory, the sovereignty's power is diverted to serve individual
   interests, in the end serving to destabilize the border, the opposite of
   the intended purpose.},

Title = {Mapping Lineage Leadership in Kyrgyzstan: Lineage Associations and
   Informal Governance},
Journal = {ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ETHNOLOGIE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {143},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-219},
Abstract = {As Kyrgyzstan constructs a modern national identity, a social
   institution long considered to be a vestige of the past lineage identity
   continues to exert significant influence over the present-day processes.
   This fact needs to be recognized and addressed. Lineage affiliations
   have gained new relevance in Kyrgyz society in the post-Soviet era. Most
   ethnic Kyrgyz people can trace their descent to one of 40 lineage
   groupings, each with a common geographic origin, graves, unique history
   and genealogy. Some have now chosen to affirm these ties by creating
   informal lineage associations that exert behind-the-scenes influence
   over daily life, as well as in national politics.
   Most importantly, lineage associations hold significant power to
   mobilize voters, control patronage, and organize protests. In essence,
   they can function as lobby groups, or even rudimentary political parties
   that reach deep into local and regional institutions. At the same time,
   lineage associations are increasingly striving for greater recognition
   in Kyrgyz politics and society. Some advocate for a formal
   constitutional role, including the creation of a special governmental
   assembly to represent them. Despite wielding considerable influence,
   kinship associations largely operate in the political shadows. The
   country's law on public associations restricts such groups from engaging
   in open political activity. I argue that lineage associations function
   as a kind of constraint and control mechanism on the political sphere,
   ensuring that no single leader is able to gain sufficient enough power
   to become a dictator, and at times also help to contain local
   corruption.
   Kyrgyzstan is not the only society in the region (or in the world) to
   consist of myriad lineage groups. One can see the emergence of the
   lineage groups in other Central Asian societies and elsewhere in the
   world (Lewis 2004; Hoehne 2016), but the Kyrgyzstan's exceptional in the

Abstract = {The article analyzes discourses and practices of historical monument
   preservation in Early Soviet Central Asia. Already at the turn of the
   twentieth century, Russian activists and scholars engaged in
   preservation work regarded Turkestan as the main archaeological treasury
   of the empire. In the sources they analyze the authors debunk a widely
   accepted view of the preservation work as a rare venue for apolitical
   cultural activity of the intelligentsia that tried to disengage itself
   from ideological service to the regime. The authors claim that, contrary
   to this view, the Soviet regime in Turkestan made preservation of the
   ancient Islamic architecture one of its most important instruments of
   propaganda and population mobilization. In this regard, the regime
   broadly relied on experts who had been involved in this work well before
   the revolution.
   The article compares discourses and practices of monument preservation
   in the late imperial and early Soviet periods, and studies the influence
   on them of broader European debates at the time about ``historical
   heritage{''} and its reconstruction. This comparison shows that
   preservation work was always perceived in the region as part of imperial
   and then Soviet integrationist projects, and as such provoked multiple
   conflicts both locally and in the capital. The turning point in the
   ideological reappraisal of the role of monuments of Islamic architecture
   came neither with the Revolution of 1917 nor after the official
   establishment of Soviet power in Turkestan in 1920. Not until the
   beginning of the process of national delimitation in Central Asia in
   1924 did local interest in cultural preservation gain momentum. Between
   1928 and 1931, national committees for monument preservation were
   established in every newly founded Central Asian republic. This
   development institutionalized the profound transformation of
   transnational cultural imagination that had been formed by the early
   twentieth century into a new, ethnocentric understanding of
   ``culture.{''}},

   destination is mainly associated with nomadic culture and natural
   resources. It also indicated that foreign visitors view the country as a
   transit, not a final destination, and that the critical aspect of the
   country's image is its poor transportation infrastructure. The article
   encourages destination marketers and policymakers to take relevant
   measures to create positive images of the country. Additionally, it
   recommends that natural resources as well as cultural endowment should
   be capitalized on, and transportation infrastructure should be improved.},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This article aims to examine the relationship between women's household
   bargaining power and their adoption of modern contraception in
   post-Soviet Tajikistan using the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey. The
   study uses direct measures of bargaining weights: a woman's ability to
   make decisions about her own health care; visits to her family or
   relatives; and contraceptive use. An additional measure defining a
   woman's financial capability to receive medical treatment for herself is
   added in the analysis to understand its correlation to women's
   contraceptive-use behaviour. The probability of using contraception is
   187 percentage points higher for a woman who has both control over her
   own health care and financial means to get medical help than a woman who
   does not have these choices. Having a say in the decision to control
   births increases the probability of using contraception by 98 percentage
   points. Our findings reveal that certain aspects of a woman's household
   decision-making and financial freedom are relevant to explain her
   contraceptive-use behaviour.},

   notion that remittances can have a positive impact on household
   well-being when measured by satisfaction with life as-a-whole. The
   results are less robust with respect to improvements in satisfaction

Abstract = {In this article we discuss how infrastructural connections - here the

   the mountainous district of Toghuz-Toro in central Kyrgyzstan - become
   sites where identities can be either confirmed or contested. Linking
   this district with places that figure prominently in the symbolic
   geography of Kyrgyzstan, which divides the country into North and South,
   the two sections of road are inherently enmeshed in regional identity
   politics. Further, the article considers how the inhabitants of
   Toghuz-Toro take care of their own mobility and preserve desired
   connections in a harsh terrain, in the absence of state-managed public
   transport, and in a situation that sees only rudimentary road
   maintenance. It shows that technologies such as mobile Internet, and
   social media such as Facebook, have engendered a profound transformation
   in the use of transport infrastructure, breathing new life into journeys
   along the old, dilapidated post-Soviet roads.},

Abstract = {Energy development has a significant impact on urbanization. This study
   employs the entropy method to evaluate the level of urbanization in
   Central Asia and further analyzes the possible dynamic transition
   mechanisms of the impact of energy development (characterized by energy
   development scale, energy trade, energy consumption, and energy
   endowment) on urbanization using the Panel Smooth Transition Regression
   model (PSTR). The results demonstrate that energy development in this
   region is characterized by ``three highs and one low{''}, namely, high
   production volume, high export volume, high endowment, and low
   self-consumption, and plays a crucial role in the progress of
   urbanization. A nonlinear relationship is found to exist between energy
   development and comprehensive urbanization in the transition economies
   of Central Asia. Generally speaking, as energy development continues to
   expand, its impact on urbanization in this region has shifted from
   constraint to promotion, with the latter gradually tending to flatten
   out. Energy development characterized by energy development scale,
   energy consumption, and energy trade can prove the point, whose
   threshold is 1.47 million tons oil equivalent (Mtoe), 0.29 tons oil
   equivalent (toe) per capita, and 20.95 Mtoe, respectively. However, not
   all energy development models exhibit this behavior. Energy development
   characterized by energy endowment is such a case where the positive
   effect of it on comprehensive urbanization will be restrained when it
   exceeds 3.18. These findings can aid decision makers in seeking a better
   energy development model to promote the sustainable development of
   urbanization in Central Asia, avoiding energy resources waste and
   disorderly development.},

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated a positive and long-running effect of
   mother-child interaction on numerous areas of child development. Yet,
   most of what is currently known derives from research on children in
   Western countries. Employing data from recent Multiple Indicator Cluster
   Surveys (MICS) on women (ages 15-49), this study examined factors
   shaping mother-child interaction across the post-Soviet countries of
   Belarus (N = 3,413), Georgia (N = 2,004), Kazakhstan (N = 5,084),
   Kyrgyzstan (N = 4,272), Moldova (N = 1,744), Tajikistan (N = 4,204),
   Turkmenistan (N = 2,064), and Uzbekistan (N = 4,939). The average number
   of mother-child interactions was highest in Georgia and lowest in
   Kyrgyzstan. Mother-child interaction was significantly lower for younger
   children, older mothers, and poorer households. Initiation of
   mass-communication campaigns and parent-child programmes could reduce
   differences in the number of interactions and improve the quality of
   maternal time dedicated to children.},

Title = {Effects of the Shift to English-Only Instruction on College Outcomes:
   Evidence from Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-120},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {English-only college education in non-English speaking countries is a
   rapidly growing phenomenon that has been dubbed as the most important
   trend in higher education internationalization. Despite worldwide
   popularity, there is little empirical evidence about how the transition
   to English-only instruction affects students? academic outcomes. Using a
   natural experiment at a selective university in Central Asia and a
   difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate the causal effect of
   switching to English-only instruction on students? college outcomes. We
   find that the introduction of English-only instruction led to a decrease
   of GPAs and probability of graduation and an increase in the number of
   failed course credits. Although negative, the effects were short-lived.
   The difference-in-differences estimates and the examination of potential
   mechanisms suggest that at least in selective universities in
   non-English speaking countries, the switch to English-only instruction
   may affect college outcomes negatively at the time of transition but may
   not necessarily imply longer-run negative effects.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results of the research under the program Global

   24 of the GIWA program). These results show that the determining factor
   for the region is freshwater shortage and the main issue is modification
   of stream flow. According to GIWA assessment estimations, freshwater
   shortage is responsible for about 70\% of the developmental problems in
   the region. The current economy is developing under conditions of
   increasing water deficiency. In spite of increasing efforts by the
   governments of the countries in the region, and by the international
   community, the situation in regard to water supply and economic
   objectives in the countries of central Asia remains tense and shows
   clear tendencies towards aggravation and conflict. The main causes for
   this sharpening of ecological and socioeconomic conditions in the region
   are analyzed, and measures to mitigate stress in transboundary
   water-resources use are presented.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)
   seeks to undermine democratisation in Central Asia. Prior studies of the
   interplay between international organisations and democracy have tended
   to examine only one half of this relationship: whether, how, and under
   what circumstances do international organisations promote democracy?
   However, the opposite has been largely ignored: how do international
   organisations sustain autocracy? Authoritarian governments are
   increasingly adopting policies aimed at preserving their political power
   and the SCO represents an additional strategy in this regard: utilising
   multilateral cooperation to defend themselves against regional or global
   democratic trends. As such, the `Shanghai Spirit' may be a sign of
   things to come as autocratic leaders become more bold in their rejection
   of democratic norms.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Community-based tourism represents an opportunity for sustainable
   socioeconomic development, helping local populations to emerge out of
   lower living conditions. This paper investigates the perceptions of
   tourists and stakeholders engaged in Community-Based Tourism (CBT) in
   Central Asian countries (including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) as an opportunity for sustainable
   development. This study's purpose is to point out the usefulness of a
   combination approach of stakeholders' and tourists' perceptions to
   address the opportunities of CBT that can improve the quality of life of
   the tourism community in Central Asia by identifying the pitfalls of
   practices and determining challenges for tourism policy. Using a
   mixed-method approach, two complementary methodologies are
   simultaneously conducted. (1) An in-depth interview approach with
   sixteen selected experts in the region was processed with semantic
   network analysis for the definition of the main challenges and
   opportunities facing CBT as an enabler of sustainable development,
   considering the perceptions of sustainability from the point of view of
   stakeholders. (2) An online survey involving one hundred twenty-five
   tourists to the region was carried out to focus on tourists' perceptions
   of sustainability. A structural equation modelling technique was used to
   identify the influence of tourists' sustainability preferences and their
   involvement with local communities on sustainability perceptions. The
   results highlight the benefits the community receives, as well as future
   opportunities to obtain more advantages from tourism practices within
   the scope of sustainable tourism planning.},

Title = {Transformation of the Ethnic Space in Countries of Central Asia in the
   Post-Soviet Period},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-193},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In accordance with the concept of geoethnocultural systems developed in
   Russian cultural geography in the last quarter of the 20th century, the
   main components of the territorial structure of the ethnic space of the
   Central Asian region as of 1989 (according to the latest Soviet census)
   and the 2010s are identified, suggesting a radical restructuring of the
   ethnic space of the region in the post-Soviet period. That period showed
   a significant strengthening of the ethnic cores of national
   geoethnocultural systems and a strong narrowing of the area retaining a
   considerable influence of the Russian geoethnocultural system. From 1989
   to 2017 the population size of the region's countries increased from 49
   to 70 million, i.e., by almost 43\%, whereas the proportion of Russians
   in the region's population decreased by nearly two times, from 9.5 to
   6.9\%. In this regard, it is proposed to strengthen the ethnocultural
   component in the strategy of Eurasian interstate integration, with a
   focus on the solution of the problems of the Russian population in the
   young States of Central Asia, which are actively involved in integration
   processes. The capital cities and territorial units of the Central Asian
   countries were grouped together according to the degree of ethnic
   transformation after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The capital
   cities of the states of the Central Asian region experienced the most
   radical ethnic transformation. Because of a significant migration
   influx, native ethnic groups began to make up the vast majority of the
   population, although in Soviet times the Republican capital cities were
   characterized by a preponderance of the Russian population. A
   significant restructuring of the ethnic structure of the population
   occurred in most of the previously predominantly Russian-speaking
   regions in the north of Kazakhstan. On the other hand, Turkmenistan,
   Tajikistan, and several regions of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, where the
   share of the nonindigenous population was low in Soviet times,
   experienced minimal ethnic transformation.},

   to central Asia and European case studies},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The complex interactions of drivers represented in scenarios and climate
   change impacts across scales have led to the development of multiscale
   scenarios. Since the recent development of global shared socioeconomic
   pathways (SSPs), which have started being downscaled to lower scales,
   the potential of scenarios to be relevant for decision making and
   facilitate appreciation and inclusion of different perspectives has been
   increasing, compared with a single-scale global scenario set. However,
   in practice, quantitative downscaling of global scenarios results in
   narratives that are compressed from the global level to fit the local
   context to enhance consistency between global and local scales. We
   brought forward the concept of scenario archetypes to analyze multiscale
   SSP scenario narratives and highlight important diverging assumptions
   within the same archetype. Our methodology applied scenario archetypes
   both as typologies, to allocate specific cases of scenarios into
   existing scenario archetypes, and building blocks, conceptualized with
   worldviews from cultural theory. Although global SSPs generally match
   existing archetypes and tend to be well defined, the socially unequal
   SSPs at subglobal scales are more nuanced, and dominant worldviews are
   much less straighforward to interpret than in global scenarios. The
   closest match was the great transition-sustainability (SSP1) archetype,
   whereas the most divergent was the market forces-fossil fuel development
   (SSP5) archetype. Overall, our results highlight the need to improve
   uptake of bottom-up approaches in global scenarios to improve
   appreciation of different perspectives as sought after in multiscale
   scenarios.},

   normalise private property rights against attempts by poor and migrant
   groups to politicise housing and social needs in Central Asia. It
   discusses the juridical understanding of justice and equality in
   relation to property rights violations on the outskirts of major cities
   in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. It argues that the juridical system is
   central in construing property rights and obligations, and in so doing
   social inequalities are legitimised and naturalised in a neoliberalising
   post-Soviet space. The article uses the concepts of `the moral economy'
   and `the juridical field' to examine how judges and lawyers justify and
   normalise their ways of interpreting and ordering the social world.},

Title = {Transferable Principles for Managing the Nexus: Lessons from Historical
   Global Water Modelling of Central Asia},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The complex relationships within the water-energy-food security nexus
   tend to be place-specific, increasing the importance of identifying
   transferable principles to facilitate implementation of a nexus
   approach. This paper aims to contribute transferable principles by using
   global model data and concepts to illustrate and analyze the water
   history of Central Asia. This approach builds on extensive literature
   about Central Asia and global change as well as recent advances in
   global water modeling. Decadal water availability and sectorial water
   consumption time series are presented for the whole 20th century, along
   with monthly changes in discharge attributable to human influences.
   Concepts from resilience and socio-ecological system theory are used to
   interpret the results and identify five principles relevant to managing
   the transboundary nexus: (1) the subsystems included/excluded from the
   nexus are case-specific and should be consciously scrutinized; (2)
   consensus is needed on what boundaries can acceptably be crossed within
   the nexus; (3) there is a need to understand how reducing trade-offs
   will modify system dependencies; (4) global stakeholders have both a
   responsibility and right to contribute to the shaping of the nexus; (5)
   combining data with global and local perspectives can help to enhance
   transferability and understanding of shared problems in our globalized
   world.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {770-787},

Abstract = {This article argues that in the contentious energy market of Central
   Asia transnational corporations (TNCs) and local governments are the
   real forces at play. While the European Union (EU) has repeatedly shown
   interest in the region, scarce profitability of the economic ventures
   and lack of control over the actual investors have resulted in a loss of
   interest. Deconstructing the EU energy security strategy towards Central
   Asia, this article reflects how TNCs formally based in Europe have used
   the `Shield of Nationality' as protection from the blows of
   resource-rich governments, while remaining driven by capital
   accumulation. A case study of the Italian oil and gas company ENI in
   Kazakhstan highlights how the mediation of home governments between
   corporations and local administrations depends on its relationship with
   the TNC. The article suggests that future research of the energy sector
   should consider the role of TNCs and their ambiguous relationship with
   their `home countries'.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Otto von Bismarck, the first chancellor of a unified Germany, was an
   active participant in the Anglo-Russian rivalry for control of Central
   Asia. Even though Germany had no direct interests there and was never
   involved on the ground during the two decades of his chancellorship,
   Bismarck invested considerable resources in working to shape the course
   of events in that part of the world, stoking the flames of conflict
   whenever it suited the dictates of Realpolitik. Over a twenty-year
   period, he actively pursued a consistent strategy that focused on tying
   down Russian troops in the remote Asian steppes, i.e., as far away from
   Central Europe as possible. At the same time, he manipulated
   Anglo-Russian rivalry in Asia to achieve various foreign policy goals
   that would further German interests. This article explores in detail all
   of these objectives, as well as their interrelationship. In particular,
   it unravels the perplexing mystery of how Bismarck was able to influence
   the politics of Central Asia from his distant headquarters in Berlin.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on farm income security in Central Asia: An
   integrated modeling approach},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {188},
Pages = {245-255},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Increased risk due to global warming has already become embedded in
   agricultural decision making in Central Asia and uncertainties are
   projected to increase even further. Agro-ecology and economies of
   Central Asia are heterogenous and very little is known about the impact
   of climate change at the subnational levels. The bio-economic farm model
   (BEFM) is used for ex ante assessment of climate change impacts at
   sub-national levels in Central Asia. The BEFM is calibrated to 10
   farming systems in Central Asia based on the household survey and crop
   growth experiment data. The production uncertainties and the adaptation
   options of agricultural producers to changing environments are
   considered paramount in the simulations.
   Very large differences in climate change impacts across the studied
   farming systems are found. The positive income gains in large-scale
   commercial farms in the northern regions of Kazakhstan and negative
   impact in small-scale farms in arid zones of Tajikistan are likely to
   happen. Producers in Kyrgyzstan may expect higher revenues but also
   higher income volatilities in the future. Agricultural producers in
   Uzbekistan may benefit in the near future but may lose their income in
   the distant future. The negative impacts could be further aggravated in
   arid zones of Central Asia if irrigation water availability decline due
   to climate change and water demand increase in upstream regions. The
   scenario simulations show that market liberalization and improved
   commodity exchange between the countries have very good potential to
   cope with the negative consequences of climate change. (c) 2014 The

Abstract = {The break-up of the Soviet Union heralded a highly unstable decade of
   decline for Russia, while also generating numerous conflicts in the
   post-Soviet space. Russia regained influence at global and, chiefly,
   Regional level from 2000, with the coming to power of Vladimir Putin and
   the rise in the price of hydrocarbons. Energy policy arguably played an
   essential role in this situation. Central Asia, the scenario of two
   secessionist conflicts at present, is crucial to Russian geo-energy
   interests. This article examines and discusses the impact of these
   conflicts on Russia's geo-energy interests, in particular since Putin
   came to power. Our conclusion is that, in a context of Russian dominance
   of the post-Soviet space and direct Russian intervention in secessionist
   conflicts in the South Caucasus and Eastern Europe in defence of its
   geo-energy interests, the two post-Soviet secessionist conflicts in
   Central Asia (Karakalpakstan and Gorno-Badakhshan) have greatly
   benefited Russian geo-energy interests. {[}Received: April 10, 2020;

   between bank concentration and stability supports the
   concentration-stability hypothesis. Moreover, higher concentration and
   well-capitalized banks increase financial stability. However, the effect
   of bank concentration and financial freedom on stability is negative and
   significant. Capital regulation and supervision from authority control
   in the financial sector need to be strengthened to solve financial
   instability.},

Abstract = {We evaluated changes in irrigation water deficit in the Fergana Valley,
   Central Asia under different scenarios of climate change and water
   management. The Fergana Valley is located within the Syr Darya river
   basin and is shared between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The
   main driver of economic activity in the Valley is cotton farming, which
   consumes large volumes of water. Growing population drives irrigation
   water demand with plans to modernize the irrigation system increasing
   the irrigated areas by 10-15\% underway. However, climate change may
   alter projected water demand increase in the Valley. We estimated the
   climate-related changes in irrigational water demand in the Fergana
   Valley in 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s using future weather patterns
   generated with five global circulation models (GCMs) run under the A1FI,
   A2, and B1SRES scenarios. Considerably higher temperatures and a
   moderate change in precipitation lead to increasing potential
   evapotranspiration (PET), which nearly doubles irrigation water demand
   by the 2080s. In turn, the area under persistent water deficits
   increases from current 12\% to 18.3\% by 2020s, 27\% by 2050s, and to
   38.2\% by 2080s. That is driving demand for a scientifically
   substantiated scheme of irrigation keeping in mind the quality of soils
   and groundwater table, correction of water consumption norms for
   different crops, and change of crop composition in favor of the winter
   horticulture plantations and cereals. On a long run, a radical
   modernization of the irrigation system will be needed to cope with
   climate change in the Fergana Valley.},

Abstract = {Instead of re-orienting towards enhancing efficiency, the attention of
   political economies of the Central Asian States continues to be riveted
   on increasing resource extraction. Hydraulic mission (engineering water
   management) maintains its dominating status within water sector reforms
   of all countries. Forging mutually beneficial regimes for
   water-energy-agriculture-climate change systems as per the nexus concept
   requires robust governance and intersectorial coordination. It is
   historically evident that the Asian countries in question utilized a
   partial nexus system under the common Soviet centralized economic model.
   Within the nexus context, the current situation is outlined against the
   background of the boundary concept, security approach, and systems
   analyses as well as its holistic melding with the decade-long integrated
   water resources management efforts in Central Asia. The ability of
   existing institutional platforms, such as basin councils, to implement a
   nexus approach to local river catchments, regional watersheds or a
   national level is examined.},

Abstract = {After the demise of the Soviet Union, the five Central Asian republics
   have struggled to maintain a degree of regional identity within the
   wider region of Eurasia by combining historical, religious and
   value-related discourses of commonality. In particular, `the Central
   Asian people' has always been hailed as the `glue' of this region,
   despite the fact that states in this area are following different
   political and economic orientations. Although `Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks,
   Turkmens and Uzbeks have lived for centuries together as brothers', as
   is often heard in regional official statements, this `regional world
   society' is being fractured by what I call the
   hyper-institutionalization of pluralist institutions of international
   society. Using an English School approach, this paper explores the
   detachment of the Central Asian international society from the Central
   Asian world society and investigates the role played by the institutions
   of the former in weakening the substance of the latter.},

   between Central Asia and China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {780},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Besides posing soaring pressure on water and land resources, the
   ever-intensifying agricultural production redistributes these pressures
   trough increasingly intensive trade. Environmental consequences are
   compli-cated and unprecedented, and postulate thorough scrutiny. Little
   attention is paid to developing regions which are small nodes in terms
   of trade volume in global trade however of visible gaps in water and
   land productivities. Five Central Asian nations (CANs) have close trade
   activities with their neighbour China, but their agricultural production
   efficiency is strikingly low and the ecological environment is severely
   de -graded. Here we evaluate, among CANs and China, the water and land
   footprints, virtual water and land trades, as well as potentials in
   enhancing water and land efficiency related to sixteen primary crop
   products, four primary animal products, and twelve derivative products
   production and trade over the period 2000-2014. We find that the blue
   water footprint and land footprint per unit product in CANs were up to
   61-and 17-times higher than in China. Through enhancing water and land
   efficiency without further inter-vention in water and land endowments,
   the scenario for CANs shows an additional food supply for feeding 387
   million people or half the starving population in the world.

Abstract = {Taking an ethnographic point of departure in the relationship between
   two women in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan - a doctor and a
   clairvoyant - the article will focus on the ambiguous ways the visible
   and the invisible intersect in the lives of the Kyrgyz. Esoteric
   experiences such as ayan, dream omens, sometimes stand out as flashes of
   insight which bring clarity and guidance, but are equally often unwanted
   disturbances which haunt people against their will. In order to do
   justice to this ambiguity I engage the phenomenology of the alien as
   developed by Bernhard Waldenfels, arguing that esoteric experiences may
   be seen as an example of what he terms radical alienness which cast
   doubt on interpretation itself.},

Abstract = {How to best govern natural resources in order to enable a sustainable
   way of handling them is what both research and practice aim to achieve.
   Empirical findings from several studies indicate that resource users are
   able to successfully cooperate in the management of common pool
   resources and solve social dilemmas through self-governance
   arrangements. The authors explore the potential success of
   self-governance in irrigation systems, focusing primarily on the factors
   influencing compliance of irrigation water users under self-crafted and
   self-enforced rules in two Kyrgyz communities. A field experiment is
   employed to provide insights and some quantitative empirical data,
   further complemented by qualitative methods (questionnaires, group
   discussions and interviews) to enhance the analysis of the findings
   about working rules in irrigation at the community level. The results
   show that Kyrgyz irrigation users of the selected communities generally
   respond better in a self-governance setting in terms of rules
   compliance, distribution efficiency and equity. Compliance and
   cooperative behavior depend on group as well as individual variables
   including communication, social norms and the legitimacy of rules.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {This article introduces a thematic issue consisting of five articles,
   which analyze the complex interrelations between gender norms and
   representations and the construction of nationalism in the post-Soviet
   republics of Central Asia. Drawing from gender and feminist studies, the
   first section explores how Central Asian nationalisms have promoted
   hierarchized gender roles to reinforce their legitimacy, noticeably
   invoking the authority of ``tradition.{''} The second section examines
   not only how the Soviet period continues to shape contemporary
   nation-building processes in the region, but also how the latter has
   been creating new historical references to emancipate them from the
   Soviet legacy - and from the Soviet policy toward women in particular.
   The third section examines how gender norms promoted by Central Asian
   states may affect women in their everyday life and how they may
   negotiate, refuse, or promote these norms. In the final section, we show
   how ``gender equality{''} has become a watchword of international
   organizations' agendas and we analyze the production and implementation
   of this international agenda setting in a specific national context.},

Abstract = {According to scholars of resource dependency, foreign funding can weaken
   rather than strengthen civil society abroad, ultimately impeding its
   effectiveness. Yet the spate of recent ``democratic revolutions{''} in
   semiauthoritarian, postcommunist states suggests that pumping foreign
   money into the nongovernmental sphere can be an effective strategy. In
   this paper Brian Grodsky argues that a critical factor in assessing the
   likelihood that a given organizational movement will succumb to the ills
   of resource dependency is the type of politicization within that
   movement. Those organizations composed of members primarily motivated by
   ideology are logically less likely to succumb to resource dependency
   than those organizations dominated by political aspirants intent on
   converting democratization into their own political power. Two case
   studies, communist-era Poland and contemporary Uzbekistan, provide
   support for this theory.},

   the Kyrgyz Affair},
Journal = {SLAVIC REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {79},
Number = {3},
Pages = {544+},
Abstract = {Supported by new archival material, this article delves deeply into one
   landmark criminal case to explore key aspects of the social, economic,
   and cultural history of illegal production and markets in the Soviet
   1950s-60s. The goal of the article (and the larger project from which it
   draws) is to use archival research to shed light on major themes in
   Soviet history. It touches on three important and promising fields:
   everyday life under late Soviet socialism; the vibrant history of crime
   and law in this period; and the history of entrepreneurial activities
   within the hyper-centralized state-planned economy, focusing on the
   dynamics of the shadow economy. The so-called Kyrgyz Affair, a famous
   and expansive shadow economy operation centered in clothing factories in
   Frunze (Bishkek), Kyrgyz Republic, is at the center of the article. I
   argue that the scope, sophistication, ambition, and success of this and
   similar operations helps us understand a significant reason why Nikita
   Khrushchev decided to introduce the death penalty for aggravated cases
   of theft of state property and bribery in 1961-62. Associated with and
   fully permeating the shadow economy, one sees many varieties of
   practices, attitudes, informal institutions and agreements, and
   relationships.},

Abstract = {This study examines how large-scale, predominantly male emigration
   affects the education of girls staying in Tajikistan, the poorest
   post-Soviet state and one of the most remittance-dependent economies in
   the world. Using data from a three-wave household panel survey conducted
   in 2007, 2009, and 2011, this study finds that the net effect of
   migration on girls' schooling turns from positive to negative with
   girls' age. These results lend support to various conceptual channels
   through which the emigration of household members may affect girls'
   education, including the relaxation of budget constraints, a change of
   the household head, and an increase in household work. At the practical
   level, the results imply that migration can be detrimental to women's
   empowerment and cast doubt on whether emigration is an appropriate
   long-term development strategy for Tajikistan.},

Abstract = {Families living in Gorno-Badakhshan-situated in the Pamir Mountains in
   Tajikistan-depend on irrigated agriculture to meet their subsistence
   needs. Because men predominate, and are most visible in, the operation
   and management of irrigation systems in this region, water-related
   activities are often labeled as masculine. Yet women historically played
   an important role in on-farm irrigation activities and even formed the
   majority of the agricultural workforce during the Soviet period. Today
   women are still responsible for the bulk of farming activities,
   including irrigation. This is partly a consequence of the difficulty of
   depending on farming alone for making a living, which leads many men to
   migrate elsewhere in search of employment. Drawing on 6 months of
   fieldwork in 2 villages in different irrigation systems, this article
   argues that although formal water rights and power are vested in men,
   this does not mean that women lack agency, nor is it necessarily a
   reflection of wider gender inequities. Understanding the power and
   equity implications of formal distributions of rights and powers among
   men and women requires an analysis that links formal rights to actual
   irrigation and farming practices and places them in broader historical
   and livelihood contexts.},

Abstract = {This article offers an explorative comparative analysis of the impact of

   Central Asia. Drawing on document analysis and in-depth interviews with
   stakeholders, the article explores to what extent the assistance
   provided by the EU and China has an impact on the ground. The article
   concludes that the EU's development assistance to Central Asia fails to
   have a significant impact, despite the EU having spent a considerable
   amount of funding in the region throughout the past two decades. In
   turn, China's foreign aid to Central Asia is more pervasive, and has a
   tangible impact on the ground. However, the positive impact of China's
   assistance, not least improved living standards as a result of enhanced
   transport and electricity infrastructure, is being offset by the
   negative implications of its increased involvement, including deepening
   economic and financial dependency.},

Abstract = {The article tells the story of debates preceding the construction of the
   Kairakkum dam in Tajikistan in 1956. In the second half of the 1940s,
   Uzbek and Tajik party leaders competed over the location of the new
   hydropower plant. Neither side wanted it to be built in their own
   republic. Eventually, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic became the
   construction site, which could be viewed as an indirect indicator of its
   subordinated position in the late Stalinist Soviet hierarchy compared to
   the Uzbek Republic, which became industrialized after massive wartime
   evacuation of factories from the European part of the country. Roberts
   restores the historical subjectivity of republican elites, who, even
   during high Stalinism, could object to Moscow's plans (with varying
   success) and advance their own visions of the region's development.},

Abstract = {Purpose Conflict and civil strife adversely affect the economy since it
   severely disrupts the normal, daily routine of economic activity.
   Similarly, economic downturns can trigger discontent that has the
   potential to escalate into social unrest and strife. Using the recently
   compiled index on social unrest (RSUI) of Barrett et al. (2020), the
   paper sets out to examine the nexus between economic growth and social
   unrest in the case of 29 Middle East and Central Asia countries over the
   period 2000-2018. Design/methodology/approach To probe into the issue at
   hand, the paper adopts a panel causality approach. To this effect, two
   panel causality tests are used. The first is the heterogeneous panel
   causality model proposed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) is employed.
   The second panel Granger causality test is the frequency domain
   causality test constructed by Breitung and Candelon (2006) and extended
   for panel testing by Croux and Reusens (2013). Findings The results of
   the causality tests indicate a strong bidirectional nexus between civil
   unrest and economic growth. The findings support the contention that
   civil strife adversely affects economic performance and economic
   downturns can trigger discontent and unrest. Research
   limitations/implications Albeit consistent and robust, the results
   reported herein concern the specific sample of countries under scrutiny.
   Extending the analysis to other groups of countries will offer better
   insights into the nexus between civil unrest and economic performance.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present
   paper is the first to address the nexus between social unrest and
   economic growth for this group of countries using the recently compiled
   index on social unrest (RSUI).},

Abstract = {After World War II, suffering from a severe workforce shortage and
   unprecedented economic devastation, the Soviet Union encouraged the
   immigration of Chinese citizens from Xinjiang into Soviet Central Asia.
   Despite the arbitrary behavior of local authorities, the immigrants were
   successfully integrated into Soviet society. But after 1963, many of the
   Chinese ``defectors{''} began to be considered a threat to national
   security, and the KGB (Committee of State Security) arrested a good
   number of them. I argue that the Sino-Soviet split affected the
   mentality and immigration policies of the Soviet Union, much like
   current relations between China and the Central Asian states shape the
   attitude of the latter toward new arrivals from China. This article is
   based on research in the Kyrgyz and Kazakh archives.},

   religious, cultural, ethnic and economic specificity, are increasingly
   turning to the conflict zones. In the context of the existing situation
   it requires careful attention, both from officials and the scientific
   community of the region. Priority basis of the paper were Central and
   Western experts survey, conducted by the authors and introduced into
   scientific use. In the course of research, the common ground and knots
   of contradictions were identified in the expert's approaches on the

Abstract = {Sino-Russian relations have swayed considerably in the second
   millennium. During the Yeltsin era, China-Russia relations were still
   strong, but this changed abruptly after Putin's accession to the
   presidency in 2000 and his initial pro-Western adventures. This was, in
   no small part, due to Russia's involvement in the war on terror,
   together with Russia's complicity in a US military presence in Central
   Asia which did not go down well in Beijing. Putin's domestic
   constituency found his swing into Washington's fold equally awkward,
   which created no small amount of criticism in Russia. Convinced that
   things could not get much worse, Putin's acceptance of NATO's expansion
   into the Baltics, his approval of US withdrawal from the ABM-treaty, and
   his quiet consent for an American military presence in Georgia raised
   additional fears in the Duma, within Russian public opinion, and to some
   extent among the Chinese. This was perceived as a direct surrender to
   American superiority and aggression, and it would not last for long.},

Abstract = {Central Asia is among the world regions that are least explored in terms
   of their history of technology. This essay reviews a wide array of
   academic literature that can serve as a base for historical research on
   technology and material culture in the region. It furthermore explores
   some of the most promising conceptual avenues for such an endeavor. The
   metaphor of a borderland, it argues, can be used beyond its geographical
   meaning to conceptualize the region's technological landscape. This
   landscape has been shaped by the coexistence of traditional artisanal
   practices and material cultures, the industrial and architectural
   legacies of Soviet rule as well as the region's recent reemergence as a
   hub between Russia, China, Europe, and the Middle East. Based on case
   studies from different disciplines, this essay therefore discusses
   technology's role in creating borderlands or territoriality, statehood,
   production, and everyday life in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the nature of British geographical work in Central
   Asia (Persia and Afghanistan) in a period when Britain was concerned

   imperial designs of France and Russia on the other. The paper explores
   the connections between geography, diplomacy and colonial knowledge and
   demonstrates how the mapping and geographical study of Central Asia was
   a central feature of British colonial ambitions and of Enlightenment
   conceptual reasoning. In illuminating the ways in which `ancient' and
   `modern' geography was at work in this politically core yet
   geographically `marginal' space, the paper highlights the complexities
   intrinsic to the making of geography and of empire in a region until now
   neglected in modern historical geography. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Water scarcity in Central Asia was analyzed by using two water scarcity
   indices at the scale of sub-basin areas (SBAs): water stress index
   (consumption-to-availability ratio) and water shortage index (water
   availability per capita). These indices were calculated for a baseline
   scenario that included virtual water flows, and again for a scenario
   where international trade was eliminated, thus assessing the role of
   virtual water flows in water scarcity. Over 80\% of the study area
   population suffers from water stress and approximately 50\% from water
   shortage as well. Removing virtual water flows considerably decreased
   water scarcity for approximately half the population. Reducing the
   exports of water-intensive products could thus be an option, along with
   other more traditional measures, for alleviating water scarcity in
   Central Asia.},

Title = {Low-carbon economic development in Central Asia based on LMDI

Abstract = {Low-carbon economic development is a strategy that is emerging in
   response to global climate change. Being the third-largest energy base
   in the world, Central Asia should adopt rational and efficient energy
   utilization to achieve the sustainable economic development. In this
   study, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition method
   was used to explore the influence factors of CO2 emissions in Central
   Asia (including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
   Turkmenistan) during the period 1992-2014. Moreover, decoupling
   elasticity and decoupling index based on the LMDI decomposition results
   were employed to explore the relationship between economic growth and
   CO2 emissions during the study period. Our results show that the total
   CO2 emissions decreased during the period 1992-1998, influenced by the
   collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent financial
   crisis. After 1998, the total CO2 emissions started to increase slowly
   along with the economic growth after the market economic reform.
   Energy-related CO2 emissions increased in Central Asia, mainly driven by
   economic activity effect and population effect, while energy intensity
   effect and energy carbon structure effect were the primary factors
   inhibiting CO2 emissions. The contribution percentages of these four
   factors (economic activity effect, population effect, energy intensity
   effect and energy carbon structure effect) to the total CO2 emissions
   were 11.80\%, 39.08\%, -14.82\% and -4.32\%, respectively, during the
   study period. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan released great
   quantities of CO2 with the annual average emissions of 189.69x10(6),
   45.55x10(6) and 115.38x10(6) t, respectively. In fact, their economic
   developments depended on high-carbon energies. The decoupling indices
   clarified the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth,
   highlighting the occurrence of a ``weak decoupling{''} between these two
   variables in Central Asia. In conclusion, our results indicate that CO2
   emissions are still not completely decoupled from economic growth in
   Central Asia. Based on these results, we suggest four key policy
   suggestions in this paper to help Central Asia to reduce CO2 emissions
   and build a resource-conserving and environment-friendly society.},

   China's involvement in Central Asia has a paradoxical and contradictory
   impact on the potential for the SCO to move beyond functionalism and

Title = {MIGRANTS FROM CENTRAL ASIA: THEIR ROLE IN CHANGING THE SOCIOCULTURE
   ENVIROMENT OF A RUSSIA MEGALOPOLIS},
Journal = {TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The research topicality is due to the fact that, under globalization,
   huge migration movement is observed in many countries. The processes of
   blurring the cultural and national boundaries of states (creation of the
   European Union, CIS, etc.) and increased migration from Islamic states
   to Europe, from the Central Asian states, former Soviet republics to
   Russia, greatly influence the processes of changing the urban
   sociocultural environment of these states. Russia is one of the major
   actors on the global scene, while the Ural region is, on the one hand, a
   rapidly developing region of the country, and on the other hand, one of
   the main Russian regions where migrants from Central Asia arrive.
   Although the issue of migration is rather well developed in the Russian
   and foreign scientific literature, poorly studied is the question of the
   migrants' role in changing the sociocultural environment of Russian
   megalopolises. Meanwhile, this topic is relevant and publicly
   significant both for the Ural region and Russia as a whole. This
   research is aimed at bridging this gap. The research objective is to
   study the role of migrants from Central Asia in changing the
   sociocultural environment of the Russian, including Ural, megalopolises.
   The research methodology combined quantitative and qualitative
   approaches. Primary data were collected with methods of a questionnaire
   (n=500) and in-depth interviews (n=30). The research revealed a new
   trend in migrant communities of the Ural region - forming ethnic elite
   in migrant communities of the same nationality, with relatively high
   income and high probability of planning to stay in Russia. The research
   showed an existing demarcation in constructing the environment of the
   modern Ural megalopolis: migrants are separated into a specific area -
   `` an immigrant community{''}, which is actually not integrated into the
   culture of the receiving country but is changing the urban sociocultural
   environment (55.0\%). These migrants create a migrant community within
   the culture of a Ural megalopolis. The research identified two large
   urban districts inhabited by migrants from Central Asia (south-west of
   Yekaterinburg and ``railroad station area{''} - Zheleznodorozhniy
   district). These are ``Kyrgyz-town{''} and ``Tajik-town{''} of the
   modern Russian megalopolis. About 60.0\% of respondents live there. The
   districts inhabited by immigrants drastically change the sociocultural
   environment of the megalopolis. The authors conclude that social
   institutions (schools, shopping malls, cafes, hairdresser's, etc.) are
   the public places where the complicated interaction between the migrants
   and the receiving community is manifested. Research of such public
   places of the sociocultural environment of a megalopolis will help to
   predict the prospects of interaction between the migrants and the
   receiving community and to identify the forming predominant models of
   such interaction.},

Title = {Trade `outside the law': Uzbek and Afghan transnational merchants

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {135-154},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article analyses the trajectories of two transnational networks
   present in the Chinese city of Yiwu: Afghan merchants who trade goods in
   and out Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan; and Uzbek traders
   (citizens of either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan) who commercialize their
   merchandise in and out Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Russia. Our aim is to
   capture an ethnographically grounded understanding of informal markets
   and economies by analysing the notion of trade `outside the law',
   including the contested yet widely used category of the `smuggler'. By
   paying attention to the fluidity of trading practices `outside the law',
   we also address the uses and limitations of metaphors widely used in
   scholarly analysis of informal markets: notably those of `lower' and
   `higher' forms of globalization, and the transposition of formal-legal
   and informal-illegal exchanges onto the notions of economic `centres'
   and `peripheries'.},

Title = {Policy analysis with Melitz-type gravity model: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several governments worldwide aim at fostering agricultural productivity
   growth by providing investment support. However, the policy's effect on
   trade for middle-and low-income countries has not been analyzed so far.
   This paper analyzes the impact of agricultural policies (credit
   subsidies and tariffs) on agricultural trade flows by modifying a
   Melitz-type structural gravity model for a small and open economy.
   According to the theory, trade flows are expected to increase with
   credit subsidies and decrease with partners' applied tariff rates. We
   analyze bilateral agricultural trade flows between Kyrgyzstan and its 69
   trading partners from 2007 to 2018 to test our theoretical findings.
   Applying the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood estimator, we find that
   credit subsidies effectively increase international trade flows while
   applied tariffs imposed on agricultural products reduce Kyrgyzstan's
   export substantially. These results can be applied to similar economies
   with publicly available data where small budgetary efforts drive trade
   expansion.},

Abstract = {Nationalists usually emphasise the timeless and primordialist origins of
   the nation, but states also make conscious efforts to construct nations.
   Drawing on the case of the Uyghurs, this article shows how states
   support certain nationalist tendencies and use them - with varying
   degrees of success - to advance particular ideologies. In the 1930s, as
   a consequence of Soviet national policy, different ethnicities joined a
   new Uyghur nation. The state therefore constructed the Uyghurs (together
   with other ethnic groups) through a political decision. In doing so the
   state emphasised the primordial aspect of Uyghurdom, however, whereby
   the nation should have existed from time immemorial and its attributes
   should be stable and firm. After World War II, both the Chinese
   government and Uyghur leaders in Xinjiang fighting against that
   government adopted this Soviet-inspired concept of a united Uyghur
   nation, and it was also adopted by Uyghurs in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan and
   Kazakhstan. States have the capacity to construct new nations, but other
   factors (geographic, political, cultural and intercommunal) can nullify
   or amplify these efforts. This is evident in southern Kyrgyzstan, where
   coexistence with Uzbeks has led to the assimilation of the Uyghurs,
   while in the north the Uyghurs have maintained their cultural
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {For centuries, animal husbandry in Central Asian mountain regions has
   been characterised by seasonal mobility over considerable distances,
   bridging remarkable elevation differences and commuting between
   precolonial states and domains. During the Russian colonial rule and the
   socialist period, pastoral movements across the borders of the newly
   created colonial administrative units and the Soviet Republics were also
   not uncommon. In the course of the establishment of independent states
   in 1991, a break occurred that strongly restricted the transboundary
   mobility practices. Using examples from the Fergana Region, this chapter
   reconstructs historical demarcation patterns and the underlying
   interests of those in charge who advocated changes while also looking at
   the effects of those changes on mobility practices of the affected
   livestock owners. Finally, the paper compares the current border regimes
   and those from the historical examples and links to related
   socioecological challenges, which can represent serious threats to the
   fragile integrity of Central Asia's post-Soviet societies.},

Abstract = {Figurative paremiae with pejorative semantics in modern Yakut and Kyrgyz
   express the negative nature and bad consequences of antihuman actions
   associated with criminals. In the context of globalization, there is a
   need of shaping individuals who combine a focus on ethnic cultural
   spiritual values, tolerance, and ability to intercultural communication.
   Family and the education system aim at promoting a wellrounded person. A
   didactic nature of figurative meaning in paremiae implies condemnation
   of inhumanity, aggression, intolerance, violence, glorification of the
   criminal world. To study linguistic manifestation of negative behavior
   of some individuals is important for elimination or reduction of its
   negative impact on modern society. Pejorative description of person in
   Yakut and Kyrgyz paremiae has not been a subject of research yet. The
   general research method is inductive-deductive, with linguistic methods
   used being the comparative method that allows receiving data on
   universal and language-specific features of phraseological units of the
   compared languages, the componential analysis, and phraseological
   identification. Comparative study of figurative paremiae in the contest

Abstract = {The demands of international researchers become more and more
   implacable: to meet an ideal of excellence, archaeologists must publish
   very good texts, in quite a large and regular number, in internationally
   renowned journals (thus referenced) and preferably in English. Since
   this activity requires permanent access to new publications, at the risk
   of rehearsing old theories, researchers need a wide access to the
   digital world where they can collect all kinds of data and diffuse their
   own scientific production. Despite their excellence, the old collections
   of the Soviet era are no longer sufficient in this new context. This
   article aims to show how the publishing means and access to this digital
   world may be problematic in Central Asia in a system where inequalities
   between the ``North{''} and the ``South{''} are now replacing colonial
   relations. However, it also shows how the collaboration of the
   Franco-Uzbek archaeological mission with the Institute of Archaeology of
   Samarkand tried to restore balance by helping to create a publishing
   centre in the early 1990s in order to overcome the publishing crisis
   which raged at the end of the Soviet era, and how the Central Asian
   archaeologists today manage their relations with the digital world.},

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the hydrologic effects of climate change are
   essential for understanding and solving potential transboundary water
   conflicts in the Zerafshan river basin, Central Asia.
   This paper introduces an identification of runoff generation processes
   and a detection of changes in hydrological regimes supporting
   Mann-Kendall trend analysis for streamflows.
   By this, the effective available and future water resources are
   identified for the Zerafshan.
   The results for the subbasins in the upper Zerafshan and for the
   reference station at the upper catchment outlet indicate that glacier
   melt is the most significant component of river runoff. The Mann-Kendall
   trend analysis confirms the regime analysis with the shift in the
   seasonality of the discharge. Furthermore, the results of the
   Kendall-Theil Robust Line for predicted long-term discharge trends show
   a decreasing annual discharge.
   The experience gained during this study emphasizes the fact that the
   summer flood, urgently required for the large irrigation projects
   downstream in Uzbekistan, is reduced and more water will be available in
   spring. Additionally, following the estimation of future discharges in
   50 and 100 years the hydrological changes are affecting the seasonal
   water availability for irrigation. This analysis highlighted that water
   availability is decreasing and the timing of availability is changing.
   Hence, there will be more competition between upstream Tajikistan and
   downstream Uzbekistan. Planned projects within the basin might have to
   be reconsidered and the changed scenario of water availability needs to
   be properly taken into account for long-term basin scale water
   management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Within the English School of International Relations the expansion of
   European International Society has always been regarded as an
   essentially European, western enterprise. However, the role that the
   Russian Empire played in expanding the institutions of international
   society into Central Asia remains quite neglected. By analysing primary
   sources and contemporary discourses about Russia's civilisational status
   in the 19th century, this paper discusses the penetration of the Russian
   Empire in Central Asia in a socio-historical perspective, and argues
   that in the process of the expansion Russia's Asiatic past weakened its
   status as a European power, and the value of its colonial enterprise.
   Using English School categories, this paper considers Russia as `a
   periphery in the centre', and as a `less civilised civiliser' in
   European International Society. In doing so, this paper seeks to explore
   an alternative way for the diffusion of norms and institutions of
   international society different from those of European `expansion' or
   `inclusion': that of `mediated expansion'.},

Abstract = {In the Pamirs of Tajikistan, meeting food needs is an ongoing struggle.
   One of the challenges to local agricultural production is water
   scarcity. This paper presents a case study of a small-scale,
   self-organized irrigation governance system in a village in the western
   Pamirs, applying the concept of ``hydrosocial arrangements{''} to
   explore its physical and social components and the interactions between
   them. It concludes that the system has proven sustainable and resilient,
   largely because of its strong sense of community ownership and its
   flexibility. Political actors and development practitioners often lack
   detailed knowledge about such well-functioning local solutions, but
   external interventions applied without that knowledge risk destroying
   effective systems that are already in place. It is important to design
   interventions that are tailored to local needs and based on a
   comprehensive and well-contextualized understanding of local structures,
   relations, and values.},

Title = {Land reform by default: uncovering patterns of agricultural
   decollectivization in Tajikistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {409-430},
Abstract = {Like that in other post-communist states, Tajikistan's agricultural
   decollectivization was initiated through top-down measures. However, the
   implementation process has not been uniform across the state's
   territory; in some districts collective farms were quickly and
   thoroughly broken up, while in others the process is just now beginning.
   In this paper, we investigate spatial variation in Tajikistan's
   decollectivization process. Through analyses of diverse data, we reveal
   that low cotton yield is a necessary condition for farm
   individualization in districts that are distant from the capital. We
   interpret this result as indicating that farm managers responsible for
   unproductive farms often have little incentive or capacity to resist the
   break-up of farms. In contrast, managers of productive farms have both
   an incentive and the capacity to maintain collective farming.
   Furthermore, although human capital dimensions, including family size,
   off-farm income and education, affect an individual farmer's preference
   for private farming, these are not necessary conditions for widespread
   farm individualization at the district level. In other words, we did not
   find evidence that farmers had the capacity to directly determine
   collective farm dissolution.},

Abstract = {Energy is critical for assuring quality of life and underpins the
   attainment of the internationally agreed United Nations Agenda for
   Sustainable Development. Countries from the Central Asia region,
   specifically Kazakhstan, will by 2050 need to reduce their dependence on
   fossil fuels from over 80\% to around 50\% in order for them to achieve
   significant negative carbon emissions thus abide by agreed international
   limits. However, Kazakhstan lacks the capacity to undertake such a
   transition alone. International support from major nations and
   organisations would play a vital role in energy transition of
   Kazakhstan. By using policy documents on renewable energy projects and
   databases on auction -based energy projects over the last ten years,
   this article aims to analyse the existing international cooperation in
   sustainable energy between Kazakhstan and China, as well as with United
   Nations. The article argues that China and the United Nations play
   unique and critical roles in supporting sustainable energy security in
   Kazakhstan. The former as a ``helper `` of energy transition and
   exporter of technologies, techniques and capital to Kazakhstan provides
   support through business know-how and, most importantly, investments.
   The latter brings together international partners for capacity building
   through policy support and consulting of government. Both are essential
   in forming an equitable sustainable energy paradigm through iENERGY
   model (interconnectivity, interplay, intelligent) to achieve the
   respective climate and energy targets. A further deepening of ties
   through iENERGY model could serve as an international standard and
   example of cooperation in energy transition and it could bring long-term
   prosperity in sustainable economic growth, political stability, and
   energy security for Central Asian region and China. (c) 2022 The

Abstract = {In 2011, the government of Kyrgyzstan increased the wages paid to
   teachers, healthcare workers, and social workers (EHS) in response to
   national strikes from teachers over low wages and working conditions.
   The EHS wage policy was adjusted between 2012 and 2015. We examine the
   literature on gender wage inequality and policies to redress
   inequalities in different countries and specifically in Central Asia. We
   use data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan panel surveys (2010-2016) and the
   Kyrgyzstan Labor Force Surveys (2009-2016) to describe the gender gap in
   wages and hours of work over time for EHS and other workers. We estimate
   panel models of the impact of the wage reform on monthly wages using LIK
   data. We find that the wage policy reduced the difference in wages
   between comparably skilled EHS and other workers, reduced the gender pay
   gap primarily in the EHS sector, and reduced the overall gender wage gap
   in Kyrgyzstan. This wage-setting policy targeted rural areas and
   narrowed the gap in wages paid to rural and urban workers. The policy
   was an effective mechanism to reduce wage inequality.},

Abstract = {The paper sheds a light on the interconnections between touristic sector
   development and regional development in Kazakhstan. The paper covers
   analysis of the current competitiveness of the touristic destinations in
   Kazakhstan. Based on qualitative and quantitative research, the study
   shows that there is a huge need for a transformation in marketing
   communications tools in order to increase the competitiveness and image
   of Kazakhstani tourism. The study provides potential scenarios and
   solutions to increase touristic attractiveness, which would lead to
   enticing more investors and increase tourism capacity and potential.
   Also, the paper provides insights in ecotourism and the regional economy
   by outlining the older and newer managerial and governmental approaches
   in supporting the entire tourism sector in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Central Asia has low labor force participation rates for women, despite
   high levels of poverty in the non-oil producing countries. Female labor
   force participation is related to competing uses for women's time,
   especially in a context of poor infrastructure and limited availability
   of purchased replacements for household labor. We examine factors
   affecting women's participation in employment and reproductive household
   work in Tajikistan, drawing on the 2003 Tajikistan Living Standards
   Survey. We incorporate specific conditions in Central Asia, including
   the prevalence of extended family households, norms about how women
   share household work, an absence of market substitutes for caring and
   reproductive labor, employment in family enterprises and poor
   infrastructure, especially in rural areas. We estimate the system using
   a Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) approach. We find that few
   individual and household characteristics are related to time in
   employment. Time in noncare reproductive work decreases if a woman
   receives direct remuneration for her employment (compared to working in
   a family farm or enterprise but receiving no direct remuneration), but
   increases if the woman has less access to infrastructure. Rural women
   spend more time in both employment and non-care reproductive work than
   urban women, but less time in care work. Lack of infrastructure may
   leave women with few choices with respect to non-care reproductive work,
   while overall levels of time poverty create pressures on care time.

   questions consisted of the measures of individuals' social networking
   behaviors and attitudes, the demographics category, and the level of
   privacy and secrecy scale. The data obtained from participating
   university students in Kyrgyzstan and Turkey were analyzed
   statistically. Accordingly, the biggest sources of anxiety for students
   on the Internet were viruses, identity theft and hackers. Females' level
   of anxiety and concern in social media was higher than that of male
   students. Turkish students were observed to pay more respect for
   personal information, legal privacy and security of Internet sites on
   social media platforms than Kyrgyz students. In terms of privacy
   behavior, Turkish students were found to be more open than Kyrgyz
   students. On the other hand, Kyrgyz students tended to hide their true

Abstract = {In some Central Asian oasis towns, the patron saints of craftsmen, known
   as pirs, have continued to be venerated, despite the repression of Islam
   and changes to the industrial structure during the Soviet Era. This
   paper analyses the social function and individual significance of pir
   veneration in the modern era, using ethnographic observations and
   interviews conducted in a ceramics town in Uzbekistan. Today, many old
   customs practised in pottery studios have become mere formalities, and
   the controlling role of the pirs over ceramist groups is declining.
   However, this is not necessarily indicative of an immediate decline in
   the pirs' power. Some ceramists believe their highly skilled masters to
   be quasi-pirs and that the pir provides them with desirable goals, in
   addition to an ideal form to which to aspire.},

Abstract = {The end of oral epics in Central Asia has been prophesied since the

   oral traditions have become marginalized, and with the ever increasing

   access to all kinds of entertainment, making the voice of the oral
   singer redundant, it would seem. Nevertheless, we can observe a
   surprising vitality of oral performance and oral traditions among the
   Kyrgyz. This paper discusses the transmission of the Kyrgyz epic
   tradition to the younger generation and the reasons why the epic of
   Manas plays such an important role for Kyrgyz cultural identity.},

   Uzbekistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {143-153},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper examines how rural transformation in Uzbekistan alters gender
   norms and roles and, consequently, affects women's involvement in
   agriculture. We focus on the role that contextual factors, particularly
   kinship relations, government goals, and institutional structures each
   contribute to rural transformation and male out migration, and how
   these, in turn, increase women's work in wheat production and
   processing. The wheat is the most important crop in the country which
   has the highest area coverage (35\%) in Uzbekistan. We begin by
   highlighting the post-Soviet transition in Uzbekistan and its effects on
   the agricultural sector, including how households respond to
   opportunities for innovation. We then move to a discussion of our
   methodological approach drawing on insights from the GENNOVATE project,
   a collaborative initiative across 11 CGIAR centres that explored the
   relationship between changing gender norms in relation to women's roles
   in agricultural production and processing. Next, we examine an
   understudied topic in migration research i.e., how the transformation of
   agriculture contributes to increased dependence on unpaid female
   agricultural labour. We conclude with an analysis of how the
   feminization of agriculture alters household relations and women's
   participation in the public sphere. Significantly, we close with a
   reflection on what these changes mean for gender and innovation studies.},

Abstract = {India has redefined its engagement with Eurasia in the last few years.
   It has sought to re-energize ties with its extended neighbourhood based
   on its historical linkages, positive and benign image, and overlapping
   security and economic interests. In this context, ties with Uzbekistan
   remain a key pillar of India's Eurasian calculus. Tashkent's strategic
   location at the crossroads of Central Asia and abundant natural
   resources form the fulcrum around which the security of Central Asia
   revolves. The country's ongoing dynamic phase of accommodative regional
   cooperation has added a new dimension to the Central Asian political
   landscape. At a time when the entire region is undergoing a significant
   transition, marked by new strategic equations and alignments between
   both the regional and extra-regional powers, a new India is seeking to
   build meaningful cooperation with a new Uzbekistan which is focused on
   energy, trade, education, connectivity, and security.},

Abstract = {Many post-Soviet governments are still unable to identify the attitude
   to religious freedom and religious activity. The human rights trend
   adjoins with a very suspicious attitude to the religious phenomena as a
   relic of the Soviet regime of the state-church relationships. Moreover,
   the professional communities and society as a whole were not
   appropriately prepared for the religious diversity or the new role of
   religion in public and private life. This article discusses why the
   government is very careful in the regulation of religious processes. The
   article also explains the reasons of inattention by Kazakhstani lawyers
   to human rights and religious issues and analyses the situation
   regarding religious freedom within frames of existing legislation in
   Kazakhstan.},

Journal = {CORNELL INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL},

Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-46},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan ranks consistently low on measures of property rights
   protection and the rule of law more generally.(1) Echoing these
   evaluations, existing literature emphasizes the degree to which informal
   institutions shape property relations in personalist, authoritarian
   regimes, like Kazakhstan. The expectation is that formal institutions
   like law and courts fail to restrain or otherwise influence state
   agents' rent-seeking behavior. In effect, they serve primarily as
   ornamentation. Regardless, these explanations fail to explain why both
   citizens and the State regularly turn to these institutions to settle
   property disputes. This Article focuses on conflicts over eminent domain
   and finds that in these cases the law provides lower and upper bounds
   for officials' rent-seeking behavior. Within these limits, law combines
   with informal practices to determine legal outcomes. Although the law
   and courts sometimes provide citizens with opportunities for limited
   redress, they also help facilitate and legitimize officials' use of
   eminent domain for personal enrichment.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study is to explore and analyse the prospects of

   possible impact on economic growth and development. The GDP growth
   rates, consumer market potentials, foreign exchange reserves, and human

   potential cooperation. Based on different databases, analytical reports
   and the authors' analyses, the study suggests closer economic
   relationships between Kazakhstan and the BRICS countries for mutual
   benefits. However, the study also identified the potential challenges of
   economic integration with regional economic blocs and possible measures
   to overcome those barriers. The economic policy implications are also
   highlighted in the conclusion. The findings of this study could
   encourage other countries to consider closer cooperation to accelerate

Abstract = {In this paper, resource dependence theory (RDT) is used to guide an
   empirical analysis of the higher education system in Uzbekistan.
   Regression analysis is applied to a panel dataset consisting of 62 Uzbek
   higher education institutions, covering the period 2000-2013, to examine
   the determinants of the expenditure decisions made by institutions. The
   key hypothesis is concerned with the relationship between the share of
   revenue from tuition fees and the share of expenditure spent on
   teaching. The analysis attempts to control for unobserved heterogeneity
   through the inclusion of fixed effects. Instrumental variables
   estimation is used to address the potential endogeneity of the
   relationship between these two variables. The main finding is that there
   is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the
   share of revenue from tuition fees and the share of expenditure spent on
   teaching, even after other factors are held constant, which is
   consistent with a core premise of RDT.},

   Since Independence},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Number = {39},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tajikistan, a country overloaded with the horrific memory of bloody
   civil war, an increasingly devastated economy, and the ineradicable
   misfortune of having long borders with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, has
   been reigning consistently by the Emomali Rahmon's regime for three
   decades with wide-scale surveillance and draconian acts. Taking
   advantage of the weak governance, poor military infrastructure and
   porous border, Islamic extremists and cross border terrorist groups have
   also been seen persistently deepening their influence in the region
   either by perpetrating a series of terrorist activities in the terrain
   or joining Tajik national into their organizations. This paper presents
   a detailed analysis of how and to what extent terrorism has posed
   security threats to Tajikistan through examining the Global Terrorism
   Database and RAND database that includes the numbers and intensity of
   the terrorist incidents in the territory since independence. It
   systematically analyses the prominent terrorist groups and, more
   particularly, the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), which has
   widened its network in the region. The paper also makes a sincere effort
   to evaluate the counter-terrorism acts adopted and implemented by
   Tajikistan. Moreover, the article also examines how the Tajik's
   authority constructs state discourse on terrorism by delegitimising
   social acceptance of the terrorist on the one hand and projecting the
   state as the severe victim of terrorism on the other.},

   2005 and 2008. Traditional healers play a significant role in
   contemporary Tajikistan, where mental health care provision is
   influenced by the legacy of Soviet psychiatry. Tajik mental health care
   may now be in a ``dormant{''} phase, characterized by a widespread
   neglect of people with mental illnesses.},

   Disorder Among Kyrgyz Adolescents},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the gaming habits,
   personality traits, and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) of Kyrgyz
   adolescents. Sociodemographic questions, gaming-related questions,
   Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGD-10), and Big Five Inventory (BFI-10)
   were used to collect data from 248 Kyrgyz adolescents between the ages
   of 11 and 21 years. The study revealed that most of the participants
   play digital games for 1 to 10 h a week. Among the game categories,
   action games are the most preferred one by the participants. Structural
   equation modelling (SEM) was used to investigate the relationship
   between Big Five personality traits and IGD. The results indicated that
   neuroticism has a positive and significant relationship with IGD. On the
   other hand, agreeableness has a negative and significant relationship
   with IGD. The results indicated that some personality traits have
   substantial predictive power in determining IGD among Kyrgyz
   adolescents.},

Journal = {MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION},

Pages = {230-241},
Abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz labour migrants seek opportunities in
   Russia where they fall target to retaliation of vigilante citizens who
   find offence in the presence of alien labourers in their homeland.
   Vigilantism also takes place within this migrant `community' where male
   Kyrgyz labour migrants engage in retaliation on female migrants over
   perceived offences such as dating non-Kyrgyz men. On several occasions
   between 2011 and 2016 videos featuring honour beating of female labour
   migrants by fellow countrymen shook the internet. The selected case
   illustrates vulnerabilities experienced by migrants due to xenophobia
   and hostility of the host state, as well as additional layers of
   vulnerabilities linked to gendered biases that `travel' across borders
   along with compatriots in migration. The study argues that offline
   structures, norms, biases, violence, and stigma not only reincarnate
   online, where they culminate in vigilante acts, but consequently, they
   re-enter the offline discourse and go through further normalization and
   justification.},

Journal = {CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Despite the imposition of Russian direct rule in 1867, the tribal
   chieftains bearing the title of ``manap{''} played a dominant role as
   effective leaders among Kyrgyz nomads throughout the imperial period.
   This article investigates why manaps were able to maintain this role and
   how the Russian military authorities dealt with them during the half
   century of their direct rule. Manaps were useful in supplementing the
   weakness of Russian rule, and, in fact, the inadequacy of Russian
   governance was a key factor enabling manaps to maintain their role as
   the primary ruling class of Kyrgyz nomads until as late as the twentieth
   century. However, Russian military authorities did not actively recruit
   manaps as political intermediaries, but were obliged to accommodate to
   them. In this sense, they were in large part ``passively dependent{''}
   on manaps, but did not actively protect or nurture them as a political
   elite.},

   research shows that the influence of leisure oriented-hedonist culture
   increases in highly developed societies like Australia At the same time
   the PWE is increasingly evident in developing countries like Turkey and
   especially Kyrgyzstan through an extension of modern/industrial
   civilization as a form of moral justification for their current social

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the association
   between international tourists' demographics with travel motives to
   Uzbekistan through the utilization of push and pull theory.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study utilized a convenience sampling
   technique to collect data from 563 international tourists visiting
   Uzbekistan. Chi-square test of independence (chi(2)) was employed to
   test the association between visitors' demographics and travel motives.
   Findings - The results illustrated that nationality and frequency of
   visitations of the international tourists to Uzbekistan were
   statistically associated with their travel motives. In terms of gender,
   age, marital status and religion, no significant association with travel
   motives was established.
   Research limitations/implications - The statistical test and instrument
   for data collection might limit the generalization of this study to
   represent the whole population of international tourists in Uzbekistan.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study show that in order
   to develop tourism in Uzbekistan, businesses and practitioners should
   consider segmenting tourists based on their national background to serve
   their needs and preferences. As tourist's visitation frequency plays a
   role in their travel motives, the product and service quality of tour
   packages must be improved and monitored.
   Originality/value - The findings of this study provide valuable insights
   for businesses, managers, practitioners and policymakers to understand
   international tourists' motives to Uzbekistan to formulate better
   policies and tour packages.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Green buildings have been actively spreading as a solution for
   sustainability issues of the construction industry in at least the last
   two decades. As green building practices unfold in developing countries,
   the need of identifying factors that both hinder and drive its spread
   rises. Multiple studies reveal a general inconsistency among results in
   different parts of the world, caused by each country's environmental,
   economic, and social conditions. Taking into account the experience of
   developing international green buildings and the current state of green
   building development in Kazakhstan, this study aims to spread the
   understanding of the factors that hinder and have the potential to drive
   the development of green buildings in Kazakhstan. A questionnaire survey
   was carried out among 38 industry experts in Kazakhstan to accomplish
   study objectives. Multiple data analysis methods were used to identify
   correlations among groups of experts and rank the factors. The results
   revealed a lack of skill/experience, a lack of government support, and
   the high cost of sustainable materials and products as the most crucial
   barriers. Water and energy efficiency, improved health of occupants,
   comfort, and satisfaction were identified as the most influential
   drivers. By expanding knowledge on factors affecting the implementation
   of green buildings, the study uncovered common trends in the responses
   of professionals, providing valuable information for field professionals
   and suggesting future research recommendations.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan's government is proud of the existing model of interfaith
   relations and uses it for claiming legitimacy at home and shaping the
   country's image abroad. To compare it with the covenantal pluralism
   ideal as outlined by W. Christopher Stewart, Chris Seiple, and Dennis R.
   Hoover, we consider both top-down dimensions (legal regulations of the
   religious sphere) and bottom-up dimensions (focusing on relational
   dynamics and interfaith dialogues). We find major discrepancies and
   argue that state paternalism, in-built hierarchies, and widespread
   suspicions and prejudices against religious minorities, inherited from
   the Soviet times, remain key features of the Kazakhstan model.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {353-377},
Abstract = {The agrarian de-collectivisation in Kazakhstan is an instructive case
   for examining the relative viability of large-scale farming vis-a-vis
   smallholder agriculture. Within the transition from communism to
   capitalism in Kazakhstan, de-collectivisation involved not only a
   redefinition of property rights but also a dramatic rupture with former
   modes of agricultural knowledge generation and use. Up to now, however,
   the role of knowledge and skills in shaping de-collectivisation has
   received scant attention in the literature on postsocialism. This
   article argues that the loss and inadequacy of knowledge, following the
   collapse of knowledge institutions and the shift from large-scale
   knowledge-intensive mechanised farming to predominantly manual farming
   on small plots, needs to form part of any explanation of the
   postsocialist agrarian crisis. The analysis shows the importance of
   studying access to, and control over, knowledge in constructing a theory
   of agricultural labour processes.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The paper considers son preference effects on actual fertility behaviour
   in Kyrgyzstan, a post-Soviet country of Central Asia. Using data from
   the DHS2012 and DHS1997, I argue that risks of transitions to parities
   from the second to the fifth are significantly higher among women with
   no sons. Furthermore, the relation of risks of parity progressions to
   sex composition of children already born is not generally stronger in
   families with strict gender asymmetries. Attempting to explain this, I
   show that in such families, contraceptive use is less frequent - and
   that could complicate the implementation of son preference in such
   families and weaken their expected contrast with other families in the
   role of son preference for fertility outcomes. The possibility also is
   discussed that son preference may be supported by factors not related to
   family-internal norms, such as the need for all families to have a male
   heir for securing family wealth.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan is located in the hinterland of Central Asia. Its virtuous
   geographical advantages and huge grain production potential make it one
   of the most important grain exporters in the world. The research on the
   problem of the grain trade in Kazakhstan is of great significance for
   food security. This study measured its international competitiveness
   using the International Market Share Index, the Revealed Comparative
   Advantage Index. Trade competitiveness index and calculated the
   international competitiveness and analyzed the influencing factors of
   grain export by constructing an extended gravity model and measured its
   export potential. Results showed that Kazakhstan has a low share of the
   international grain market: however, wheat. barley, and buckwheat have
   strong export advantages; the level of economic development and economic
   distance has significantly promoted the scale of grain exports. While
   geographical distance, the difference in GDP per capita, and the fact
   whether trading partner countries have joined the Eurasian Economic
   Union have caused obstacles to grain exports. Kazakhstan's export
   potential to 6 countries including Russia. Kyrgyzstan and China shows an

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The problems of efficient use of energy costs have been actively
   explored in recent decades in connection with rising energy prices.
   During this period, the main models for assessing energy efficiency and
   energy management were developed, including the models Total Quality
   Management, Six Sigma and Sustainable Value Stream Mapping. The aim of
   the research was to study the energy efficiency of the production and
   services in Kazakhstan based on materials of the large-scale national
   study on the estimation of production and transaction costs by these
   methodologies. To assess the data obtained, a statistical analysis of
   the dependence on the indicators of variation and ranking was used.
   Electricity costs are among the leading manufacturing costs and affect
   management models. However, according to the maturity model of energy
   management, energy efficiency in Kazakhstan is low. Despite the
   government's declarations of effective energy policies, the
   administrative burden for businesses remains high, and legislation does
   not stimulate a reduction in energy costs.},

Journal = {HISTORICAL JOURNAL OF FILM RADIO AND TELEVISION},

Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {263-273},
Abstract = {This article investigates the emergence, development and role of the
   newsreel during the Soviet period of Kazakh history. In particular, it
   focuses on the Soviet Kazakhstan' series, which was produced over six
   decades. The article stresses the value of the newsreel as an historical
   source, one relatively neglected in the past. It explores the reasons
   why the new Communist authorities were attracted to the newsreel, a mass
   medium that could play a central role in the building of a socialist
   society. It goes on to consider the relationship between the message' of
   newsreels and the ideological stance of the Communist Party - and
   particularly on those occasions when the two were literally out of
   sync'. The article also investigates the subject matter of newsreels
   produced in the 1930s and 1940s and the extent and nature of party
   control. It discusses the changes of the 1960s, changes that allowed for
   a greater emphasis on character in addition to the simple portrayal of
   events. It argues, however, that these changes were modest and that,
   even in the 1980s, the predominant images were of factories and combine
   harvesters. It concludes that the newsreel played a central role in
   promoting acceptance of the principles of Communism and, perhaps more
   prosaically, in raising hopes of a better future. While accepting that
   Soviet Kazakhstan' was always ideologically conditioned, the article
   contends that it did create an invaluable screen chronicle that
   reflected at least some aspects of reality.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper studies the trade credit and delinquency behavior in
   Kazakhstan paying attention to the effects of two recent crises using a
   unique dataset of large firms and SMEs from the year 2009 to 2016. Our
   estimates suggest that the relationship between trade and bank credit is
   mainly substitutional except that it was complementary for large firms
   following the year 2014-5 crisis. This new piece of evidence on the
   non-uniform relationship between trade and bank credit during crisis
   might provide more insight into the mixed findings in the literature. We
   also discern that trade credit demand is more prevalent among
   capital-intensive firms. Kazakhstani firms pass along a sizeable portion
   of their delinquent receivable to their trade credit suppliers. The
   transmission of trade credit delinquency, additionally, is amplified
   during the year 2014-5 economic crisis but the year 2009 global
   financial crisis.},

Abstract = {Cultural diplomacy using diasporic communities as facilitators of

   suggests a typology of networks of communication derived from a case
   study of long-established diasporas living in post-independence

   typology juxtaposes the official stance of homeland governments
   expressed in formal and legal provisions with the lived experience of
   the diaspora communities. The study highlights the benefits of
   developing vibrant valued' networks of communication embracing both
   local diasporas and homeland embassies and agencies. In such cases,
   diplomatic benefits accrue to the homeland and local communities are
   empowered. Similarly, failing to capitalise on positive sentiment with
   some infrastructural support may leave an expressive' network as one of
   neglected potential.},

Pages = {181-196},
Abstract = {This paper examines the new ways to navigate family power dynamics among
   Muslim youth in contemporary Uzbekistan. Migration of labour from
   Uzbekistan increased rapidly in the 2000s. When young workers began to
   experience the freedom of making their own decisions in their everyday
   lives after migration, they became uncomfortable with the elders of the
   household making decisions on everything from daily chores to serious
   matters concerning their families. Youth who continued to live in
   Uzbekistan also expanded their areas of self-determination, such as in
   choosing their spouses, by securing private space through the use of
   mobile phones. The mobile phone can be an effective tool to improve the
   position of young wives, who tend to have the lowest status in the
   husband's family. Thus, the existing hierarchy or classical patriarchy
   in Muslim families can be navigated, challenged and circumvented by the
   use of mobile phones among the youth today.},

Title = {Occupational burnout and lifestyle in Kazakhstan cardiologists},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Background: No data exist in the published literature on burnout in
   physicians from Central Asia. The aim of this analysis was to assess
   burnout prevalence in doctors and nurses of a cardiological hospital in
   Almaty, Kazakhstan and ascertain whether smoking, alcohol and physical
   activity may predict job-associated burnout.
   Methods: The staff of the City Cardiological Centre of Almaty (N = 259,
   82\% females) filled in the questionnaire with the questions on
   demographics, lifestyle, including smoking, alcohol and physical
   activity, as well as fatigue (using Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)) and
   burnout using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Human Services Survey for
   Medical Personnel. We compared the scores of emotional exhaustion (EE),
   depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA) between doctors
   and nurses.
   Results: We found significant differences in the smoking prevalence,
   alcohol use and regular physical activity, but no mean scores of burnout
   between men and women. High DP was prevalent in 52\% doctors and 45\%
   nurses, whereas high EE was found in 32 and 26\% and PA in 16 and 32\%,
   accordingly. In contrast with EE and DP, PA score was greater in nurses
   (median 38, interquartile range (IQR) 17) compared to doctors (median
   41, IQR 9). Age, sex, work duration, smoking or physical activity could
   not predict higher burnout, whereas FSS score was associated with higher
   burnout of all dimensions (p < 0.05), and never-alcohol could predict
   higher PA burnout (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: In Kazakhstan cardiologists, high prevalence of DP burnout
   should target specific preventive strategies and the association of
   alcohol use with PA needs further deeper insight.},

Abstract = {The paper evaluates the use efficiency of agricultural land in the
   Republic of Kazakhstan using physical and relative measures, as well as
   a consolidated criterion defined as the volume of gross output of crops
   per 100 ha of agricultural land. The assessment of agricultural land use
   was conducted in the period between 2012 and 2016, after which the
   acquired results were benchmarked against the results of 1990. That year
   was set as a reference point since it gives an indication of the
   Republic's achievements in agriculture while it was still part of the
   USSR. The undertaken analysis has shown that between 2012 and 2016, most
   agricultural land use metrics tended to have a positive dynamic. Despite
   that, the country has never regained the agricultural performance level
   it had back in 1990. The agricultural land use score according to the
   consolidated criterion has also demonstrated an insufficient land use
   performance compared to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The approved ABI
   Growth Government Program for 2017-2021 outlines efforts aimed at the
   efficient utilization of the country's land resources, helping boost the
   output of domestic products.},

Abstract = {This mixed-methods study uses Push and Pull model, as well as the

   experiences of international faculty who work in the Global South.
   Treating these faculty members as self-initiating expatriates pursuing a
   boundaryless career, the study reveals that one of the key push factors
   is shortage of jobs in the international market. While salary remains an
   important pull factor, nonmonetary motivations, such as the desire to
   contribute to change, are also important motivators. When making the
   decision to relocate, international faculty are balancing career
   consideration with the desires to remain truthful to their values and to
   fit the career with their personal lives. Most faculty expect to stay in
   the country for a short term, thus presenting challenges for institution
   building. They also anticipate that international mobility will leave a
   positive effect on their careers.},

Abstract = {The most recent land reform in Uzbekistan, in which Large Farm
   Enterprises (LFEs) were split into medium-sized fermer enterprises,
   left, alongside the country's overwhelming majority of small dekhan
   peasants, continued strong state intervention in agrarian production.
   Three `forms' (rather than `modes') of production emerged: (1)
   state-ordered production of cotton and wheat; (2) commercial production,
   in particular of rice; and (3) household production of other food
   staples, including wheat and rice. These production `forms' or processes
   are characterised by distinct input and output relations, terms of trade
   and technical requirements. They interrelate through competition for
   limited resources, such as land, water and other inputs, rather than
   competition amongst the actors themselves (the state, the new
   medium-sized fermers and the small dekhan peasants). A contest over
   resources is particularly evident between the (state-ordered) cotton
   crop and the (commercial) rice crop in the case study on which our
   argument is based, namely the province of Khorezm, a downstream part of
   the Amu Darya river basin, in the western part of the country.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the factors that shape the establishment of
   transparent institutions in resource-rich countries with a specific
   focus on Kazakhstan. Specifically, it draws upon in-depth interviews and
   analysis of key institutions to understand the pace and intensity of
   transparency reforms in the Central Asian state. It argues that external
   transparency promotion can lead to institutional reform only when it is
   matched with strong elite incentives in favor of reforms. Kazakhstan has
   had few incentives to comply with Western initiated norms before 2014,
   an era of relative economic security. As a consequence, the political
   elite often stalled the successful implementation of reforms. However,
   the economic turbulence following the fall of oil prices and Russia's
   annexation of Crimea have motivated the Kazakh government to embrace the
   norm of transparency in order to attract foreign investment. (C) 2017

Title = {Farmers' Perceptions of Tree Shelterbelts on Agricultural Land in Rural
   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The reestablishment of agroforestry systems in Central Asia, combining
   crop production with protective tree shelterbelts, provides significant
   potential to improve farming systems. This includes increasing crop
   yields, additional income from timber, as well as reducing soil
   degradation and wind erosion. Thus, adopting shelterbelts as a form of
   pro-environmental behavior provides a number of socio-economic benefits,
   although some trade-offs need to be considered as well. This paper
   investigates factors that shape the perception of-and attitude
   towards-the establishment of tree shelterbelts by farmers in two case
   study regions in Kyrgyzstan. Applying a conceptual framework
   distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic factors, research methods
   included semi-structured interviews with farmers and local policy
   makers. The results show spatial differences in the perception of
   shelterbelts, both on the regional and on the village scale. In general,
   shelterbelts were negatively perceived by more than half of the farmers.
   The main concern raised by farmers was the shading of crops by
   shelterbelts, resulting in a decrease of yield. In addition, small field
   sizes and potential conflicts with neighbors were key concerns.
   Furthermore, rules set by local self-government bodies were inconsistent
   with the legislative framework, posing significant restrictions to the
   adoption of sustainable land use practices.},

Abstract = {Ethno-racial and linguistic boundaries have major implications for
   socio-economic well-being throughout the world, yet their specific
   effects vary greatly across contexts. The countries that were once part
   of the Soviet Union have seen dramatic transformations yet also
   exhibited remarkable continuities from the socialist era. This article
   contributes to cross-national evidence on the roots and expressions of
   ethno-racial socio-economic inequalities and on nation building and
   nationalism in the post-Soviet context. It uses data from two
   identically designed nationally representative surveys conducted in
   Kyrgyzstan in 2011 and 2017 to investigate patterns and trends in ethnic
   and linguistic disparities in employment by occupational type and
   economic sector and in earnings among men and women. The authors find
   that despite government policies to promote the advancement of the
   nation's titular majority, Kyrgyz, and to encourage the use of its
   language, the ethno-linguistic economic inequalities inherited from the
   Soviet era - privileged positions of the European-origin minority and of
   Russian-speaking Kyrgyz - were still potently present in the earlier
   survey. While variations in types of occupation and employment sectors
   tended to diminish between the two surveys, the ethno-linguistic
   differences in earnings remained very pronounced, even after controlling
   for other factors. The authors relate these findings to the extant
   scholarship and reflect on their implications for our understanding of
   post-socialist transitions.},

Abstract = {Most cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan are production cooperatives-successors
   of former collective farms. There are hardly any ``pure{''} service
   cooperatives, although a survey conducted as part of this study reveals
   that production cooperatives partially fulfill the function of service
   cooperatives by providing farm services also to nonmembers. Most
   respondents highlight difficulties due to shortage of inputs and
   inadequate access to farm machinery, including lack of machinery leasing
   options. Difficulties with product sales, access to financial sources,
   and veterinary services were highlighted with lower frequency, but still
   by more than 20\% of respondents. These are precisely the problem areas
   that service cooperatives are designed to overcome. Respondents indicate
   that cooperatives play a positive role in rural life: they improve
   service delivery to farmers and the perceived wellbeing is higher for
   cooperative members than for outsiders.
   Formal cooperation as manifested in membership in cooperatives is very
   limited among the farmers surveyed. Informal cooperation is much more
   widespread, and the substantial gap between the frequency of formal and
   informal cooperation (8\% and 22\% of farmers surveyed, respectively)
   clearly suggests that there is a large potential for development and
   adoption of service cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan.
   Cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan are few in number and widely scattered. More
   than half the respondents report that there is no cooperative in the
   vicinity that they can join. Other reasons for not joining a cooperative
   (fear of losing independence, lack of information about cooperatives)
   manifest lack of clear understanding of the differences between service
   and production cooperatives and strongly suggest that cooperative
   development requires a large-scale information campaign to familiarize
   the rural population with the working of cooperatives.},

Title = {Evaluation of furrow irrigation practices in Fergana Valley of
   Uzbekistan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {133-144},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {The performance of furrow irrigation systems in terms of application
   efficiency, runoff ratio, and water requirement efficiency were
   evaluated at nine different sites within the Provinces of Fergana (6
   sites) and Andijon (3 sites) in Uzbekistan. A total of 46 irrigation
   events were evaluated during the year 2009, whereas only a total of 8
   irrigation events (at 3 sites) were evaluated during the year 2010. Most
   of the selected fields have slopes greater than 0.005; hence, the
   average runoff volume from these fields was 39\% of the total volume of
   water applied to the fields, indicating problems with selection of
   appropriate furrow flow rates under the given set of field conditions.
   For several fields, the seasonal volume of water applied was
   significantly different than the irrigation norms specified for the
   site. Though some of the farmers followed the irrigation advisory
   service on when to irrigate, there was a large mismatch between the
   volume of water applied and the volume of water deficit within the crop
   root zone. Reliability, in terms of magnitude and duration of flow rate
   received at the fields, was a major issue at all the sites. Considerable
   fluctuations were observed in the flow rates received at all the field
   sites during each irrigation event. In addition, the average flow rate
   received at the field sites varied considerably between irrigation
   events making it difficult for farmers to manage irrigation water.
   Farmers that had high watertable (less than 100 cm from the ground
   surface) still applied large volumes of water, resulting in low
   application efficiency. Several recommendations for improving the
   performance of furrow irrigation systems in Uzbekistan are provided. (c)

Title = {Uzbekistan: A Critical Analysis of the Official Discourse on Terrorism},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Number = {37},
Pages = {21-35},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since its independence, Uzbekistan has often portrayed terrorism as one
   of the gravest threats to its sovereignty, integrity, unity, and
   internal stability. Uzbekistan's authoritarian regime has been perceived
   endorsing and executing a series of counter-terrorism policies to
   exorcise this hazardous threat that includes all possible tactics for
   eliminating terrorism from the respective region. Unlike the state's
   proclamation about the increasing gravity of the terrorist threat, some
   international human right organizations and Central Asian experts depict
   an opposite picture of it. They are seen to be very critical of the
   state's exaggerated version of the terrorist threat and question the
   state's intention behind such projection. This paper makes a systematic
   effort to critically examine how Uzbekistan's authoritarian leaders have
   constructed official discourse on terrorism, taking into consideration
   the social, political and economic context of the region. The paper also
   examines the authenticity of the state's continuous projection of
   terrorism to be one of the gravest threats to the sovereignty and
   integrity of the region by incorporating and analyzing a detailed

Title = {Energy security in Kazakhstan: The consumers' perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {155},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the consumers' perceptions and opinions
   regarding various threats, impediments, and opportunities present in
   Kazakhstan when it considers its energy security. The chosen theoretical
   framework allows consumers' views to be explored through the lens of
   three variations of the energy security concept: as an arrangement
   ensuring availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability
   of resources; as security of energy supply; and as conceptualisation
   that focuses on ever-increasing utilisation of renewables and a
   corresponding decrease in reliance on fossil fuels. Using a qualitative
   approach based on in-depth interviews, this study identifies the
   consumers' views on three themes including security of energy supply,
   the role of renewables in ensuring energy security, and the links
   between energy security and environmental sustainability. The findings
   show that the views of the majority of study participants on energy
   security can be distilled into the opinion that oil is a guarantor of
   the nation's independence and stability. Study participants do not see
   how energy security links to economic restructuring. As for the role of
   renewables in strengthening energy security, residents of rural areas
   are likely to contribute to renewable energy generation. Interviewees
   viewed the role of renewables in ensuring ecological sustainability as
   very insignificant.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the e-voting experience of the local elections
   undertaken by Osh city Council in 2016. The process was introduced to
   ensure fair and democratic elections in Kyrgyzstan after continuous and
   repeated violent political uprising. The e-system, based on biometrics
   registration, biometric identification of voters and automated vote
   counting, was designed to help to avoid the most common election frauds:
   vote buying, carousel voting and group/family voting. The case study,
   mainly based on interviews, illustrates the adaptation and modernization
   of strategies to resist and cheat within the e-voting system. The
   analysis outlines three widely practised cheating strategies: procedural
   violations, such as avoiding cross-checking of manual and automated
   counting and allowing voting without biometrical identification;
   transformation of bribery into `vote auctioning'; and strengthening of
   kinship-based/regional support and tribal/regional identity under
   conditions of e-voting.},

Journal = {SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH},

Volume = {138},

Abstract = {We use a new formal, practical, and easily decomposable measure to
   examine vulnerability to poverty in Tajikistan during the global
   financial crisis. Our strategy is to estimate a first-order Markov model
   of household expenditure with the aim of identifying the vulnerability
   of households to poverty. We use Bayesian methods which allow us to
   estimate the limiting expenditure distribution. Importantly, by
   introducing the index of vulnerability as the weighted probability of a
   household falling into poverty over a given time horizon, we can use the
   estimated dynamics to assess short, medium and long-run vulnerability.
   We find that during the ``recession transition{''} almost all households
   were vulnerable to poverty while almost none were during the ``recovery
   period{''}. Overall, urban households, more educated households and
   households receiving remittances from international labor migrants were
   less vulnerable to poverty. While households with a current or very
   recent migrant did not have a significantly lower measured vulnerability
   to poverty, those households receiving remittances from migrants had a
   lower vulnerability to poverty. Our findings stress that the
   international labor migration from Tajikistan may not be a reliable
   means of welfare security for households because external economic
   shocks and internal political decisions can negatively affect the
   Russian economy and lead to a reduction of remittance flows to
   Tajikistan.},

Journal = {SOCIOLOGUS},

Abstract = {In 1935, the Soviets founded a logistics company to provide automobile
   access to the remote Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province of Tajikistan.
   The administrative center of this company was situated in Osh, in the
   south of the Kyrgyz Republic. After the fall of the USSR, the families
   of around three hundred Badakhshani Tajiks, former employees of the
   logistics company from the Tajik SSR, stayed in Kyrgyzstan. They
   gradually crystallized as a community and have become stronger with the
   recent support of an international non-governmental development agency,
   the Aga Khan Foundation.
   Based on biographical interviews with members of the Badakhshani
   community in Osh, this paper shows that migrant transnationalism can be
   ``pre-structured{''} by states' or development agencies' implementation
   of policies, It argues that rather than development being an expected
   outcome of migration, transborder mobility can emerge as a result of the
   implementation of multiple modernization or development policies, both
   governmental and non-governmental, internal and external.},

Abstract = {Cotton production in Uzbekistan is known as `white gold' and constitutes
   a strategic centrepiece of the country's rural economy. However, the
   gradual ongoing process of market-oriented reform has had a severe
   impact on the cotton sector. The objective of this paper is to estimate
   the efficiency and total factor productivity growth of cotton farms in
   Uzbekistan. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was applied to measure
   technical efficiency and the Malmquist Index was used to estimate and
   analyse productivity. The analysis was based on a sample of 26 cotton
   farms observed between 2007 and 2009. The results help to provide a set
   of policy recommendations regarding the sector's growth potential
   through the efficient utilization of resources, and indicate that there
   has been a moderate decline in productivity attributed to technical
   degeneration over the period studied.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how political and economic transition has affected
   the system of agricultural production in Khorezm, Uzbekistan in terms of
   economic practices and relationships. Based on recent fieldwork, the
   paper argues that the local agricultural economy is a hybrid economy,
   where production for market, quasi-market and subsistence merge into and
   co-constitute one another. In order to keep the system going, and to
   make up for the uncertainties in the formal context of production, the
   relation between new private fermer and the peasant (dehkan) households
   is of particular importance. This relation resembles neo-patrimonial
   patron-client relations, which are both personal and informal while also
   being based on formal, contractual relations. The relations are
   asymmetric and based on the limited and unevenly distributed resources.
   The division of power is unequal but not fixed, due to the ongoing
   transition of the economic system.},

Abstract = {Uzbekistan has recently initiated a series of reforms in the wake of
   (former) President Islam Karimov's death in 2016. To what extent and why
   does Tashkent seek to liberalize? Concurrently, the United States -
   which curtailed ties with the Uzbekistani government in the aftermath of
   the 2005 Andijan massacre - has expressed renewed interest. What do
   Washington and Tashkent seek to gain by improving relations? This
   article posits that while the United States aspires to bolster regional
   support for the War in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan is mainly interested in
   consolidating a new regime and balancing against nearby Great Powers. As
   such, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's reformist drive should not be
   construed as a categorical embrace of good governance but a means to
   reestablish Uzbekistan's geopolitical footing after more than a decade
   of isolation. Based upon this assessment, both sides can work to foster
   avenues for cooperation, while the United States encourages Uzbekistan
   to liberalize at its own pace.},

Abstract = {President Islam Karimov's death provides an opportunity to gauge the
   origins and consequences of Uzbekistan's foreign policy. This article is
   aimed at contributing to that on-going conversation. To do so, it
   assesses the nature of Uzbekistani foreign policy, which the author
   categorizes as a type of defensive self-reliance, and to what extent the
   latter conditioned the government of Uzbekistan's international
   engagement. The author describes the main features of self-reliance and
   argues that the pursuit thereof led to five key trends: the relentless
   concern with international equality; a focus on bilateral relations; an
   aggressive defence of Uzbekistan's image; a drive for self-sufficiency;
   and a reluctance to embrace expansionist ideological agendas. To make
   his argument, the author begins by conceptualizing and distinguishing
   between `defensive' and `offensive' manifestations of self-reliance. He
   then traces the patterns of Uzbekistani self-reliance and concludes with
   a brief assessment of potential consequences were the foreign policy to
   change in the near future. The conclusion suggests that a shift from
   defensive to offensive self-reliance may constitute a problematic change
   to Uzbekistani foreign policy, but that relaxing any other of those
   trends may help open up the republic and the region of post-Soviet
   central Asia as a whole.},

Abstract = {Dust/sand storm is a common phenomenon in arid and semi-arid regions of
   Kazakhstan, especially in its southern parts, where areas are covered by
   a great variety of deserts and are a powerful source of mineral and salt
   aerosols. We considered the long-term meteorological data and satellite
   images on dust storms recurrence and their regional division in
   Kazakhstan. On the basis of generalization and analyses of the numerous
   cartographic materials, meteorological observations and satellite
   images, we identified seats of the powerful sources of dust/sand/salt
   storms. We found areas in Kazakhstan with the highest frequency of dust
   storms. These are Pre-Aral Karakum and Aralkum deserts; Kyzylkum and
   Moiynkum deserts; Ryn sands (northern Caspian plain); and southern
   Pre-Balkhash deserts. The most active source of dust storms is located
   in sandy deserts or in areas, which have suffered from human activity.
   Dust storms have a great negative impact on soil conditions and they are
   particularly dangerous for the environment.},

Title = {Learning autonomy: higher education reform in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-289},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Higher education is a key economic and social priority in the global
   arena. Many countries have sought to advance reforms aimed at increasing
   access, promoting greater educational quality, and ensuring financial
   responsibility and sustainability. Often, strategies for achieving these
   aims are informed by experiences elsewhere. However, transporting
   education policy reforms can be problematic. Kazakhstan, a signatory of
   the Bologna Process, offers an example of a country seeking to improve
   student access and success and promote greater fiscal efficiency to
   advance the overall quality of its higher education system (Merrill in
   Int High Educ 59:26-28, 2010). A key strategy for achieving these goals
   is through reforms in university governance. In Central Asia, policy
   makers advance education reforms in order to accomplish several goals,
   including meeting ``the new demands of ethnic nationalism, a globally
   competitive economy, and a labour market freed from administrative
   control{''} (Anderson and Heyneman 2005, p. 361). In Kazakhstan, policy
   makers have concluded that a system predicated on decentralized control
   with greater institutional autonomy (and accountability), along the
   lines of the US system, offers a promising strategy for improving the
   overall quality of its higher education system. This research collected
   on-site data on Kazakhstani higher education and presents the most
   recent data since efforts from OECD and World Bank in 2006 {[}OECD in
   Higher education in Kazakhstan (reviews of National Policies for
   Education). OECD, Paris 2007]. This research utilized semi-structured
   interviews with senior higher education administrators (53), members of
   the Ministry of Education and Science (6), a representative from the
   government (1), and experts from the World Bank (2) for a total of 62
   participants. The results of the study show that academic leaders in
   Kazakhstan want greater autonomy. However, there is no clear consensus
   about what level of fiscal and academic autonomy is desirable and
   whether all institutions are prepared to manage themselves without
   Ministerial oversight. The roles of key constituents in academic
   governance have also not yet been clearly defined.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, millions of its
   former citizens moved to other countries. Kyrgyzstan, having experienced
   painful transition from command to market economy, sends a large share
   of its workforce abroad, and consequently, receives remittances that

   United States in search of economic opportunities, both legally and
   through irregular methods. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews
   with 42 Kyrgyz labor migrants, this paper examines their economic
   integration in the United States. The author proposes a conceptual

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6, S},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article applies a real options model to the problem of land
   development. Making use of the 1998-2001 Kyrgyz Household Budget Survey,
   we show that when the hypothesis of decreasing return to scale holds,
   the relation between the threshold value of revenue per hectare and the
   amount of land cultivated is positive. In addition, the relation between
   the threshold and the amount of land owned is positive in the case of
   continuous supply of land and negative when there is discontinuous
   supply of land. The direct consequence is that, in the first case,
   smaller farms will be more willing to rent land and exercise the option
   where, in the second case, larger farms will exercise first. The results
   suggest three main conclusions: (i) the combination of uncertainty and
   irreversibility is an important factor in land development decisions,
   (ii) farmer behavior is consistent with the continuous profit
   maximization model, and (iii) farming unit revenue tends to be
   positively related to farm size, once uncertainty is properly accounted
   for.},

Title = {Global financial economic crisis transmission on the transition economy
   Case of the Kyrgyz Republic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMIC POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The global financial crisis hit the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic by
   the third wave of its transmission in early 2009. The purpose of this
   study is to examine the impact of the global financial economic crisis
   on the transition economy of the Kyrgyz Republic. As there is a low
   level of the Kyrgyz Republic's integration into the global financial and
   economic processes, it is obvious that channels of transmissions are
   different.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The empirical model is the vector autoregression approach. The quarterly
   data from 2005 to 2013 of the remittances from abroad, trade volumes,
   exchange rates, credits, deposits and liquidity of the banking system,
   gross domestic product (GDP) and foreign direct investment (FDI) were
   used in the empirical analysis.
   Findings
   The authors found a significant positive relation between transmission
   channels such as remittances flow, banking sector, international trade
   and GDP within the first six months. Thus, a decline in the
   aforementioned variables has a significant affirmative effect on the
   country's GDP. Notwithstanding, the exchange-rate channel adversely
   influences GDP. Thereby, the depreciation of the national currency leads
   to an increase in GDP.
   Originality/value
   The study findings allow the Kyrgyz policymakers to foresee the global
   crisis transmission through the primary channels of transmission
   mechanism. Nevertheless, a decrease of the deposit level by 1 per cent
   leads to 2.91 per cent decline in FDI inflows. On the contrary, an
   increase of the exchange rate by 1 per cent leads to 1.54 per cent
   decrease in imports.},

Abstract = {The article is focused on the analysis of problems of development and
   forecasting of small enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic in the field of
   education. The methodology of forecasting the gross income of small and
   medium-sized enterprises in the field of education is offered. An
   approach related to the use of the least-squares method as a forecasting
   tool is proposed. In this regard, the conditions of formation and
   functioning of the market of paid educational services in the Kyrgyz
   Republic, which are closely related to the definition of demand, supply
   and market prices for educational services are characterized. The
   results allow us to accurately determine the interval in which we can
   predict with maximum probability the future volume of the gross income
   of small and medium-sized enterprises in education from 2019 to 2023,
   which will slowly decline. It was also found that small enterprises in
   education have certain advantages over large educational institutions.
   They are more dynamic, faster and more efficient in responding to
   changes in the domestic market, both in times of growth and in times of
   crisis. The findings of the research reflect the actual situation. They
   are adequate and can be useful in assessing the effectiveness of
   business creation in the Kyrgyz Republic in the provision of educational
   services.},

Abstract = {A primary mechanism of rule in soft authoritarian post-Soviet Kazakhstan
   was the regime's ability to monopolize the instruments of persuasion. By
   carefully crafting and propagating images of state and society,
   constructing political dramas, and developing plausible public
   narratives about the provision of public goods, Nursultan Nazarbaev
   continually outflanked his political opponents. And then came Borat, the
   Hollywood comedy that presented Kazakhstan as a racist, homophobic,
   misogynistic, economic, and political backwater. Not only were the
   images of this ``Kazakhstan{''} out of the regime's control, but the
   film's creator, Sacha Baron Cohen, went on the image-making offensive by
   conducting a variety of public dramas that further eroded the regime's
   image-making monopoly. This essay explores how the transnationalization
   of image-making creates new challenges for regimes intent on remaining
   soft authoritarian.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Fascination with English medium instruction (EMI) is fast
   growing in higher education institutions in non-native English-speaking
   countries, including Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstani government adopted a
   trilingual education policy in 2007 and the Bologna Process in 2010.
   Both these initiatives motivated universities to offer academic
   programmes in the English language. As a result, EMI programmes are
   offered in over 70 higher education institutions across Kazakhstan. In
   addition, there are four major Kazakhstani universities which offer
   academic programmes in English only. Despite the increase in the number
   of EMI programmes, there is a lack of empirical evidence about the
   difficulties and challenges faced by students in the EMI programmes.
   Aim. The present study aimed to investigate the nature, forms, and
   levels of challenges graduate students face in academic reading and
   writing in English and the way they cope with these challenges. The
   study was conducted with graduate students and faculty in 10 selected
   Kazaklistani universities, which offer academic programmes in EMI.
   Research methodology and methods. The study is based on a mixed-method
   design, involving an online survey and semi-structured interviews. The
   closed-ended questions have been analysed using SPSS software
   (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The grounded theory
   analysis was utilised to scrutinise open-ended questions and interview
   transcripts.
   Results and scientific novelty. The study's results indicated two major
   challenges faced by graduate students in academic reading and writing:
   the personal-psychological challenge and sociological challenge. The
   first challenge includes students' previous academic backgrounds,
   exposure, and learning experiences. The second challenge is related to
   English academic culture and students' worldviews, concepts, and values
   about English as a language and medium of instruction. As a result,
   graduate students experienced a lack of vocabulary, inadequate academic
   literacy skills, unfamiliarity with academic writing styles in English,
   and lack of skills to synthesise reading materials.
   Practical significance. Hence, this study recommends systematising
   English language programmes across secondary and higher education
   institutions to help students acquire advanced English language
   proficiency. Also, the study results suggest that local faculty members
   should be trained according to international standards in terms of their
   English language skills and innovative teaching methods.},

Abstract = {In December 2017, the government of Kazakhstan adopted the program
   ``Digital Kazakhstan{''}. New strategies of digitization are implemented
   with different levels of success in different countries, and the concept
   ``digitization{''} has two decades of development and more than eighty
   years of scientific gnoseology. The purpose of the work is to analyze
   the features and perspectives of digitization in Kazakhstan by the
   example of such direction as functioning of E-government. The authors
   use quantitative methods of research, including systematization and
   processing of statistical data with the help of correlation and
   regression analysis. On April 12, 2006, Kazakhstan adopted the system of
   E-government. Kazakhstan is ranked 33rd in the global ranking of the UN
   according to the level of development of e-government. Despite the
   activity of the people of Kazakhstan during usage of the e-government
   portal, the issue of information security of personal data is still
   topical. The main barrier and a vivid contradiction is full mismatch
   between the tasks of digitization and the critically low level of access
   to broadband Internet. The program ``Digital Kazakhstan{''} does not
   contain the measures that develop human capital in this direction, as
   well as other institutional measures that ensure ``creation of
   conditions for transition of the economy of Kazakhstan to a completely
   new trajectory of development, which ensures creation of digital economy
   of the future in the long-term{''}.},

Abstract = {In this article I focus on the importance of folklore archives in
   staking heritage claims and in disputes over cultural ``ownership.{''} I
   use as a case study the Manas epic which is shared by post-Soviet
   Kyrgyzstan and China's Kyrgyz minority. By analyzing the actors who took
   part in the transcription of the epic, the conditions under which these
   tran-scriptions were conducted, and the results they yielded, I show
   how, in the case of Kyrgyzstan, turning the epic from an oral tradition
   into a literary monument that could be claimed as national heritage was
   a long story of suffering and coercion, aspirations for reward and
   recognition, disaccords between holders of official authority and
   subor-dinates, and never-ending personal conflicts, all under the
   constantly looming threat of political repression. I contrast the uses
   of collections of transcripts under Soviet rule and in the
   post-independence period which overlapped with the UNESCO-driven
   heritage rush worldwide. I argue that while under Soviet rule the
   transcripts of the epic were ``raw data{''} which editors, translators
   and scholars could bend according to their needs or their expertise,
   after independence these transcripts have been used both as a means of
   authenticating the epic and claiming it as heritage. I conceptualize
   this process as the ``transvaluation{''} of folklore archives, or a
   process in which transcripts were turned into valuable historical
   artefacts by downplaying the agencies involved in their production and
   the circumstances under which it took place.},

Abstract = {This article explores the affective force of infrastructural
   intervention. It focuses on the construction, successful in one case,
   locally stalled in the other, of so-called independent roads' along
   Kyrgyzstan's porous land-border with Tajikistan. Chinese-built and
   funded through an array of international lending organisations, such
   roads are determinate interventions in the social life of a marginal
   border region. They are also the site of intense local anticipation: the
   object both of hope for a materially secure future and of anxieties of
   entrapment. The very alignments that enable a new road to come into
   being - the mobilising of elected representatives, the appeal to
   languages of abandonment and territorial loss - are themselves
   anticipatory and experimental moves. The category of infrastructural
   hope' is developed to explore this articulation of material politics
   with diffuse elite and vernacular desires for a territorially secure
   future. The article considers the implications of this entanglement for
   the anthropology of infrastructure and for the analysis of
   trans-boundary tension in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {Despite progress in poverty reduction achieved over the last two
   decades, Tajikistan's food security situation remains challenging.
   Recent studies and analyses have highlighted progress as well as areas
   that require increased attention from the Government of the Republic of
   Tajikistan and international development partners. The paper argues that
   a systems approach that takes into consideration policy interventions by
   different sectors is required to more effectively improve access and
   affordability of healthy diets, contributing to a better food security
   and nutrition situation of the population.},

Abstract = {Powerful countries use foreign media broadcasts to enhance their soft
   power, yet there is scant empirical evidence as to whether such efforts
   actually sway public opinion abroad. Moreover, researchers have not
   specified conditions that may shape variations in the influence of
   foreign broadcasts and internet. We propose a theory that predicts,
   respectively, opinion-formation and issue-framing effects of foreign
   broadcasts as functions of the pervasiveness and familiarity of the
   issues they cover. We test our hypotheses by examining the potential
   effects of exposure to Russia-sourced broadcasts on views of Russia and
   other foreign policy issues in Kyrgyzstan, a most likely case of foreign
   media effects. Using an original, nationally representative survey
   conducted in Kyrgyzstan in 2015, we find that the influence of Russian
   media on Kyrgyzstani opinions varies according to the pervasiveness and
   familiarity of the issues at stake and is more limited than
   traditionally believed. The modest and conditional effects of foreign
   media in this particularly favorable environment cast doubt on the
   assumption that media are a soft-power tool ``par excellence{''} and
   call for further research on how media can be used effectively for
   public diplomacy.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The human-induced desiccation of the Aral Sea has generated large
   amounts of salt dust and has been posing a great threat to local
   ecological environment and human health. Monitoring its land cover
   changes is essential to obtaining information about the desertification
   process and dynamics of potential salt/sand dust source. To this end,
   long-term Landsat imagery was applied for the land use/cover change
   analysis based on support vector machine approach. The land cover
   distribution of the study area for 1977, 1987, 1996, 2006 and 2015 was
   mapped. In addition, the Markov-cellular automata integrated approach
   was used to predict the land cover change in 2015 and project changes in
   2025 by extrapolating current trends. The classification results
   revealed that water surface of the Aral Sea shrunk by more than 66\%,
   leading to the dramatic expanding of the salt soil and bare area. Change
   detection analysis indicated a serious land degradation trend as well as
   a major land cover evolution mode in the Aral Kum that could predict
   shifts in dust composition. The Markov-cellular automata technique was
   successful in predicting land cover distribution in 2015, and the
   projected land cover for 2025 revealed more desertification of the
   landscape with potential expansion in the salt soils and bare area. It
   is worth noting that the vegetation cover of the region represented an
   obvious increase in recent years that may be a good signal of ecological
   recovery.},

   governance of farmer adoption of selected technological innovations
   (i.e., constructed wetlands and biogas) to improve crop productivity
   while providing water and energy savings. We build upon farmers'
   expressed views of the strategic decisions they would take regarding
   constructed wetlands and biogas plants. We use institutional analysis to
   identify relevant action situations, highlight potential institutional
   complementarity between these situations, and indicate promising areas

Abstract = {Agriculture is a significant component of the Central Asian economies.
   Since independence, the republics have implemented agricultural reforms
   in varying measure, yet production has fallen sharply across the region.
   The more ambitious agricultural reform programs have included measures
   aimed at liberalizing agricultural marketing, trade and prices. However,
   so far the expected supply response has yet to emerge. The objective of
   this paper is to highlight key policy and research issues surrounding
   reform of agricultural markets. It summarizes the main features of
   agricultural performance since the reforms, highlighting trends in grain
   and cotton, livestock, input use, and trade and analyzes key constraints
   to improvement of the sector, emphasizing price policy, sequencing
   problems, and institutional weakness. It presents a research agenda by
   identifying the main research needs for better agricultural policy
   design. It calls for more research on input and output market
   efficiency, private sector development, the effects of reform on
   farmers, sequencing issues, comparative advantage, water management,
   land tenure and farm size. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the factors that affect Kyrgyzstan's bilateral
   trade flows with its main trading partners and attempts to predict trade
   potential for Kyrgyzstan. Using panel data, the gravity model is applied
   to estimate Kyrgyzstan's trade from 2000 to 2016 for its 35 main trading
   partners. The coefficients derived from the gravity-model estimation are
   then used to predict trade potential for Kyrgyzstan. Results proved to
   be successful and explained 63\% of the fluctuations in Kyrgyzstan's
   trade. According to the results, Kyrgyzstan's and its partners' GDP have
   a positive effect on trade, while distance and partners' population
   prove to have a negative effect. Predicted trade potential reveals that
   neighboring countries (China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan)
   and Russia still have a significant trade potential. Kyrgyzstan, being a
   less developed economy, even by Central Asia standards, can only achieve

   its overall trade with the rest of the world. Therefore, it is essential
   to study the main determinants of Kyrgyzstan's bilateral trade. In this

   trade. This study is the first attempt to apply to the gravity model to
   Kyrgyzstan in an attempt to predict trade potential.},

Abstract = {This article investigates gendered nationalist ideologies and their

   investigation of clothing items and practices. Clothes ``speak

   nationhood and various interpretations of what `` proper{''} Kyrgyz
   femininities and masculinities should be. Clothing thus becomes both a
   sign and a site of the politics of identity, inscribing power relations
   and individual strategies of Kyrgyz men and women onto their bodies.
   Individual clothing choices and strategies take place within the general
   context of discursive struggles over what authentic and appropriate
   representations of Kyrgyzness should be. Thus, such clothing items as ak
   kalpak (conical felt hats) and the practice of Muslim women covering
   their head (hijab) acquire social and political meanings that stand for
   wider processes of identity contestations in the country.},

Abstract = {The collapse of state ownership, following the dissolution of the Soviet
   Union, launched a new era of self-employment and small businesses in
   need of financing services throughout the region. This research
   investigates whether the traditional microfinance lending paradigm that
   adopts a two-pronged mission of financial sustainability and poverty
   outreach applies to young commercialized microfinance institutions in
   Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The analysis employs a residual
   standard error approach to ordinary least squares and 2-stage least
   squares estimation, as well as recursive model estimation. The results
   suggest that financial sustainability can be adversely affected when
   interest rates exceed a threshold of 80 per cent and an individualized
   instead of group lending approach is adopted. However, poverty outreach
   is improved by servicing small loans to more borrowers, particularly
   women.},

Title = {The impact of land degradation on agricultural profits and implications
   for poverty reduction in Central Asia},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {126},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Land degradation is a major challenge to sustainable development and
   poverty reduction across the world. This paper estimates the
   contribution of land degradation to the losses in agricultural profits
   in the four countries in Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. We used a production function approach to
   relate multiple factors including land quality to farmers' profits; we
   evaluated the latter by combining hitherto unique nationally
   representative agricultural household surveys with remotely sensed data
   on land degradation hotspots. The findings show that land degradation
   that had occurred over the previous three decades reduced net farming
   profits among agricultural households by 4.8 times during the 2009-2010
   cropping season compared with the case without land degradation. Land
   degradation reduced net agricultural profits of all categories of
   agricultural households in the region, both poor and rich. At the same
   time, contrary to widespread beliefs that poor agricultural households
   cannot cope with land degradation due to limited access to resources,
   the results also showed that the poor households applied more
   sustainable land management practices than the richer agricultural
   households. This is because they had a stronger dependence on land for
   their livelihoods; hence, had a stronger incentive to sustainably manage
   it. These findings mean that poverty does not need to inexorably lead to
   land degradation and to subsequent vicious cycles exacerbating poverty.
   At the same time, increasing poor farmers' wealth by sustainable land
   management alone may be challenging, requiring additional accompanying
   policies to address structural and institutional reasons for poverty.},

Abstract = {This paper challenges dominant understandings of `rising powers' by
   developing a decentred, relational account of Russia and China in
   Central Asia. We ask whether Moscow and Beijing's regional integrative
   strategies do not guide, but rather are led by, everyday interactions
   among Russian and Chinese actors, and local actors in Central Asia.
   Rising powers, as a derivative of `Great Powers', are frequently
   portrayed as structurally comparable units that concentrate power in
   their executives, fetishise territorial sovereignty, recruit client
   states, contest regional hegemony and explicitly oppose the post-1945
   international order. In contrast, we demonstrate that the centred
   discourse of Eurasian integration promoted by Russian and Chinese
   leaders is decentred by networks of business and political elites,
   especially with regard to capital accumulation. Adopting Homi K.
   Bhabha's notion of mimicry (subversion, hybridity) and J. C. Scott's
   conception of metis (local knowledge, agency), and using examples of
   Russian and Chinese investments and infrastructure projects in Central
   Asia, we argue that in order to understand centring discourse we must
   look to decentring practices at the periphery; that is, rising power is
   produced through ongoing interactions between actors at the margins of
   the state's hegemonic reach.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Water resources among five Central Asian countries are distributed
   unevenly. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the conflict between
   water and land use has become increasingly serious. Due to limited data,
   the temporal and spatial characteristics and trends of crop water use
   efficiency in Central Asia over the past 60 years remain unclear. This
   paper combines state-level agricultural statistics data and cultivated
   land data (1975, 2005 and 2015) from remote sensing imagery and
   calculates crop water use efficiency based on the FAO crop coefficient
   method. The results are as follows: (1) the development of crop
   cultivation in Central Asia is divided into an expansion period
   (1960-1990), a reduction period (1990-2000), and a recovery period
   (2000-2016); (2) the grain yield in Central Asia increased from 0.9 to
   1.9 t/ha during 1960-2016, with Uzbekistan having the highest, reaching
   4.2 t/ha in 2016. Cotton yield increased during 1960-1990 and decreased
   from 1990 to 2016. (3) The grain water use efficiency in Central Asia
   increased from 0.22 kg/m(3) to 0.39 kg/m(3) during 1960-2016. The cotton
   water use efficiency increased from 0.23 kg/m(3) to 0.30 kg/m(3) during
   1960-1990, has decreased since 1990, and is currently close to the 1960s

Abstract = {The word `slavery' conjures images of cruelty, racial bigotry and
   economic exploitation associated with the plantation complex crucial to
   the Atlantic trading economy from the seventeenth to the nineteenth
   centuries. Yet this was only one manifestation of practices of human
   bondage. This article examines the practice of `slavery' in a very
   different context, looking at Central Asia, Afghanistan and the Punjab
   in the early nineteenth century. Here, bondage was largely a social
   institution with economic ramifications, in contrast to its Atlantic
   counterpart. Slavery served a social, and often sexual function in many
   of these societies, with the majority of slaves being female domestic
   servants and concubines. Its victims were often religiously, rather than
   racially defined, although bondage was a cross-confessional phenomenon.
   The practice continued to be widespread throughout the region into the
   early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the demand for money in Kazakhstan. This
   study covers the period starting from 2000:01, when capital
   liberalization program was launched and the National Bank approved
   managed float regime (the National Bank employed adjustable exchange
   rate regime before exchange rate crisis in Kazakhstan in 1999) to
   2007:12 as recent available data for investigation variables. In order
   to achieve the goal we set demand for money function is estimated using
   cointegration methodology aimed for variables integrated of order one.
   The results show important key factors for controlling money demand
   could be applied by the National Bank of Kazakhstan. Besides, there was
   reversal of currency in Kazakhstan over the period under investigation.},

Title = {Drivers of financial and operational efficiency of MFIs: empirical
   evidences from Eastern Europe and Central Asia},
Journal = {BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2679-2697},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Purpose The study attempts to examine the bias-adjusted financial and
   operational efficiency estimates of microfinance institutions (MFIs)
   operating in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region during the
   financial year 2017-2018. In addition, the study also identifies the
   responsible factors determining the financial and operational
   performances of MFIs operating in the ECA region.
   Design/methodology/approach The study employs two-stage bootstrap data
   envelopment analysis (DEA). In the first stage, the authors incorporate
   the bootstrap procedure in the DEA framework as suggested by Simar and
   Wilson (2000) to estimate the bias-corrected efficiency scores of 67
   sample MFIs. In order to identify the drivers of efficiency level, the
   study deploys the bootstrap truncated regression model following the
   Simar and Wilson (2007) guidelines in the second stage of analysis.
   Findings The authors note from the empirical results that MFIs operating
   in the ECA region are relatively more financially efficient (0.588) than
   socially efficient (0.496). However, none of the MFIs were found to be
   operating at best-practice frontier while considering the bias-adjusted
   efficiency estimates. Further, the results of second stage of analysis
   confirm that corporate governance, that is, board size has positive and
   statistically significant impact on MFIs' performances. In addition, the
   bad credit quality deteriorates both financial revenue and operational
   efficiency. Moreover, the MFIs' size, profit status and debt-to-equity
   ratio were also found to be statistically significant to determine the
   operational and financial efficiency of MFIs in the ECA region.
   Practical implications The study provides the robust efficiency
   estimates and factors responsible to determine the financial and
   operational efficiency of MFIs operating in the ECA region. Further, the
   empirical results of the study provide the inputs and further direction
   to the policymakers, regulators, practitioners and managers in framing
   the policy and optimal operating strategies for ECA MFIs industry.
   Originality/value The study extends the DEA analysis by incorporating
   the bootstrap procedure in DEA model to estimate the bias-adjusted
   efficiency scores which are more reliable and robust. In addition,
   bootstrap truncated regression has been applied to identify the drivers
   of efficiency. Moreover, in the literature there is no single study
   which has deployed the double bootstrap DEA framework to examine the
   financial and operational efficiency estimates and its drivers.},

Abstract = {This article explores the use of camels for baggage transport by
   European colonial armies in the nineteenth century. It focuses in
   particular on two episodes: the Russian winter expedition to Khiva, and
   the march of the Army of the Indus into Afghanistan, both of which took
   place in 1839. However sophisticated their weapons and other technology,
   until at least the 1880s European colonial armies were forced to rely
   exclusively on baggage animals if they wanted to move around: railways
   arrived very late in the history of European expansion. In Central Asia
   this meant rounding up, loading, managing and feeding tens of thousands
   of camels, which could only be furnished by the pastoral groups who
   inhabited the region, who in some cases were also the objects of
   conquest. Camel transport placed certain structural constraints on
   European conquest in Central Asia: firstly it meant that the forces
   involved were almost always very small; secondly it prevented the
   launching of spontaneous or unauthorised campaigns by ``men on the
   spot,{''} as every advance had to be preceded by the rounding up of the
   necessary baggage animals, and the creation of a budget to pay for then.
   Finally, the constraints imposed by camel transport ensured that British
   and Russian armies would never meet in Central Asia, and that a Russian
   invasion of India was a chimera.},

Abstract = {While photography in early Soviet Union is a well-researched field,
   researchers addressed hitherto mostly Soviet Russia. The history of
   photography in the Central Asian Soviet Republics, though, lacks
   research. This article focuses on the means of production and
   distribution of photographs taken in Uzbekistan 1926-1937. With Roland
   Barthes theory of ``connotation{''}, it interprets the visual invention
   of the Soviet Orient. Photographs by Georgij Zel'ma and Maks Penson of
   Uzbekistan that were published in Soviet mass media are analyzed,
   determining style, content and function. Through additional textual
   analysis, I discuss the network of photographers on the periphery and
   image agents on the centre. Socialist connotations are derived from
   appropriations of pre-revolutionary photographs accompanied by false
   textual framing, innovative compositions of ethnographic images and
   combinations of local cultural symbols with Soviet modernity. As
   photographers, primarily from Moscow, travelled to Central Asia, they
   greatly dominated its visual depiction. Although they emphasized Soviet
   modernity, they also reproduced older stereotypes about the Orient.
   Besides offering a history on photography, this article also discusses
   the establishment of Soviet cultural structures between the centre and
   the periphery as well as the subordinated agency of local actors at the
   periphery.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of historical transformation of water
   management in Central Asia with the specific focus on Uzbekistan. The
   time frame of the analysis is from the Middle Ages to contemporary
   times, with different political, social and economic settings in the
   framework of theory of transformative capacity of institutions.
   Empirical evidence suggests that the approach of the hydraulic mission
   has not changed dramatically over the years, but transformed into
   various forms of control on water management. In recent decades,
   integrated water resources management paradigms are gaining momentum,
   while the traditional, State-centric, hydraulic mission approach is
   losing its attractiveness in the arid Central Asian region.
   Nevertheless, the State-centric model of water management still persists
   in the region with clear signs that water management is still more under
   sociopolitical control.},

Title = {Construction of Girls' Educational Projects in Kyrgyzstan from the
   Intergenerational Perspective},
Journal = {CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The present paper considers the main constraints and opportunities in
   the construction of girls' educational projects in Kyrgyzstan in
   relation to their subjective well-being from the intergenerational
   perspective. Today children have got new educational opportunities
   brought by various social transformations; at the same time, they come
   across new challenges which are often related to social inequality and
   economic problems on the local level. Especially female educational
   trajectories seem to experience noticeable effects of these
   transformations. The author uses the theoretical concept of social
   capital to observe the role of the family in the construction of girls'
   educational projects. In addition to this, the applied intergenerational
   approach allows to observe the changes and continuities in parent-child
   relations. The findings show that in Kyrgyzstan ``being
   well-educated{''} continues to be an essential element, the foundation
   of girls' educational projects, similar to how it was for girls' mothers
   in the same age. In the context of a strong hierarchical family
   structure and low level of state opportunities, today girls tend to rely
   only on family social and cultural capital for the realisation of
   educational projects. However, families' actions are often aimed at the
   future prosperity, neglecting children's interests at the present time.
   Besides, girls face gender-specific limitations related to the
   perception of women's roles in the society. The frames within which
   girls can take decisions regarding educational trajectories are strongly
   defined by their families. This often leads to the feeling of
   uncertainty among girls and ambivalence between global promises and the
   ``actual{''} local opportunity structures.},

Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},

Volume = {39},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {During the last decade, to boost the national economy, Kyrgyzstan has
   strived to develop its mining industry through efforts to attract
   foreign investors. However, at the same time, Kyrgyzstan has had an
   increasing number of conflicts between mining companies and local
   communities. Study of the Chatkal Valley case suggests that the local
   resistance now leading to severe conflicts may have been encouraged by
   poor governance of the mining industry and lack of cooperation between
   stakeholders, also contributing are the industry's and some levels of
   government's lack of acknowledgment of social impacts. The article
   argues that adequate assessment and management of the social impacts of
   mining are vital to the sustainable development of both the industry and
   the society in which it operates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Is the Belt and Road Initiative 2.0 in the Making? The Case of Central
   Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA},
Abstract = {Despite China's claims that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an
   economic co-operation initiative that will foster economic growth and
   industrial development for recipient countries, to create trade and
   investment opportunities, and promote peace in the world, the perception
   of the BRI throughout the world is becoming negative. In response to
   international criticisms of BRI implementation, in 2019, China's
   President Xi Jinping pledged to deliver a readjusted BRI 2.0 that would
   generate benefits for all participating countries, not China alone.
   Moreover, due to the pressure from recipient countries, Chinese
   authorities and companies have been applying several readjustment
   measures in their BRI activities. Central Asia is a priority region for
   China's foreign policy under the BRI. BRI implementation has helped to
   expand China's economic interests and influence in Central Asia.
   However, China's push for the BRI implementation is China-centric,
   rather than a credible multilateral endeavour as claimed by the Chinese
   government. As shown in the case of Central Asia, the BRI involves a
   series of bilateral deals. There is no multilateral decision-making
   process involved in overseeing BRI or making investment decisions.},

Abstract = {In rural Kyrgyzstan, homes built by their owners house multigenerational
   families and are filled with objects that have been bought, made,
   acquired, and received. Many of them come as gifts cementing alliances
   with other families through marriage. This article discusses how kelin
   (daughters-in-law) and their families negotiate aspects of themselves
   and their relationships through interactions with these objects and
   places of domesticity. Many studies of Central Asia identify
   patrilineage and land as major factors in the constitution and
   experience of kinship and personhood. This article shows how the home
   provides an interesting alternative site for the examination of these.
   It is a perspective, moreover, that is vital when women's experience is
   relatively overlooked. Ethnographic fieldwork with households in
   Kyrgyzstan is drawn on to discuss the significance of domestic places
   and domestic objects for daughters-in-law. It highlights the negotiation
   of personhood outside the more discursively powerful locations such as
   lineage, place, and geographical region. It does so through focusing on
   ways of experiencing, envisioning and creating old and new homes,
   arguing that these are intimately connected to personhood. It is
   suggested that homebuilding can be understood as an explicit narration
   of self, while daily interaction with objects in the home is a more
   implicit form of self-expression and negotiation.},

Abstract = {Does self-insurance, such as access to savings or assets, affect support

   ability to privately manage income risk and economic uncertainty
   influences voter redistributive preferences, we know relatively little
   about how self-insurance affects evaluations of government in the first
   place. To gain traction on this question, we combine cross-sectional and
   panel public opinion surveys from 28 countries in Central Eastern
   Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia with macro-data on economic
   performance. Exploiting variation in citizen responses to the Great
   Recession, we show that by enabling citizens to smooth consumption,
   self-insurance affects how they form economic perceptions. Moreover, we
   find that self-insurance bolsters support for incumbents. Results allow
   us to better understand why economic downturns may not dampen support
   for government, even when economic hardship is rife and access to public
   safety nets is limited.},

Title = {Coping with changing water resources: The case of the Syr Darya river
   basin in Central Asia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {68-77},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper discusses how climatic-hydrological and socio-political
   developments will affect water allocation in the Syr Darya river basin
   and which adaptation measures will be needed to cope with changing water
   resources. In view of the geo-political complexity, climate-driven
   changes in water availability are of particular importance in this
   region. Water shortages during summer will become more frequent as
   precipitation is expected to further decrease and glacial meltwater
   releases will decrease in the long-term due to reduced glacier volume.
   Being the main valve to the entire Syr Darya river system, the Toktogul
   reservoir in Kyrgyzstan could take over, at least partly, the role of
   glaciers as seasonal water redistributors, thus allowing the generation
   of energy in winter -benefiting upstream countries - and irrigation for
   large-scale agriculture in summer-benefiting downstream countries. To
   date, however, there is no regional consensus on a balanced reservoir
   management, which currently favours irrigation according to past Soviet
   priorities. Moreover, the perception of water as a `national concern' in
   Central Asia discourages efforts towards cooperation between states at
   the regional level. So far, climate change adaptation has focused on
   technical rather than institutional solutions. We suggest that
   policy-relevant adaptation measures should include consistent data
   collection and dissemination, cross-sectoral collaboration, promotion of
   national responsibility and initiative, and agreeing on a regional
   strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Learners' Perceptions of Online Exams: A Comparative Study in Turkey and

Abstract = {As online learning is becoming very popular in formal educational
   settings and in individual development, online exams are starting to be
   recognized as one of the more efficient assessment methods. Online exams
   are effective in either blended or traditional forms of learning, and,
   when appropriately used, bring benefits to both learners and the
   learning process. However, learners' perceptions of online exams in
   developing countries have not been widely studied despite the potential
   of such research for contributing to more effective use of online exams
   in these countries. Thus, this study served two purposes. First, it
   aimed to investigate students' perceptions of online exams at a state
   university in Turkey, and at a state university in Kyrgyzstan. Second,
   the study compared the results. Structured as a mixed study, the
   research was conducted during the 2018-2019 fall term. The participants
   were 370 undergraduate students taking first-year courses online.
   Quantitative data considered learners' perception scores gathered via a
   survey, whereas qualitative data considered learners' opinions in
   response to an open-ended question. According to the quantitative
   analysis, learners' perceptions differed according to gender, major, and
   prior online course experience variables. In addition, Turkish and
   Kyrgyz learners differed in that Turkish learners found online exams
   less stressful and more reliable and fairer than traditional paper-based
   exams when compared with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The qualitative
   analysis provided important results for future planning in both
   institutions.},

Abstract = {In many remittance-receiving countries, evidence linking remittances to
   household economic stability and investment is limited. Using three
   cross-sectional national surveys (1999, 2003, 2007) we compare
   remittance-receiving to non-remittance households in Tajikistan, a
   country highly dependent on remittances. Exploring household perceptions
   of financial security, wealth and entrepreneurial activity, across a
   period of rising remittance reliance, we find that households receiving
   remittances are not more economically stabile, wealthier, or
   entrepreneurial than non-remittance households. Findings highlight the
   importance of conceptualising remittances as a process influenced by the
   developmental contexts within receiving countries, and question previous
   assumptions concerning development pathways.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the subjectivities of working class people in

   neoliberal changes. While working class people are depicted as
   unenterprising and `backward' by the rich and the middle classes, they
   often react with anger and lament the colonisation of life by market
   values, usually invoking non-market norms and nostalgia for the Soviet
   era of labour, solidarity and equality. Most importantly, they draw upon
   alternative cultural resources and discourses, such as traditional
   morality and Islam, to develop alternative `caring' and `pious' selves,
   which dissociate wealth from moral worth and provide other sources of
   self-esteem. But these counter-values can also be problematic, as they
   are ineffective in countering market forces and hardening class
   divisions.},

Abstract = {Examining the European Union's (EU) engagement with Central Asia since
   the early 1990s, we see an increased commitment to context sensitivity.
   Arguably, in order to design `better' interventions, the EU needs to
   know more about this region. This article explores three means of EU
   learning: in the field - through EU officials' first-hand experience of
   working at EU Delegations in Central Asia; about the field - through
   programmed channels of external expert knowledge, and in particular
   think tanks; and from the field - during institutionalized consultations
   with multiple local actors, such as academics, journalists and
   non-governmental organizations. It is argued that despite this complex
   learning infrastructure, EU knowledge production on Central Asia has a
   predominantly performative character. Rather than leading to changes in
   its relations with Central Asia, new knowledge produced by the EU aims
   at legitimizing this organization's pre-existing frameworks of
   engagement and practices of interactions with the region, and
   substantiating existing policy priorities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of female
   students enrolled in STEM majors in highly internationalised university
   to understand how the various sets of cultural gender-related
   expectations shape their experiences. We were interested in how
   different cultures existing within the university and outside the
   university influence the girls pursuing education in STEM majors and how
   they deal with the conflicting discourses in this unique context. It was
   identified in the study that three conflicting discourses and,
   subsequently, various actors -faculty, potential employers, peers, and
   parents shape young women's experiences in STEM education and career in
   contradicting ways. Such a clash between different values and influences
   results in girls' ambiguous understandings of their future careers as
   they progress in their studies. The results of the study offer some
   important insights into women's experiences in STEM education, which
   have significant implications for higher educational administrators,
   faculty, and policymakers in non-western and larger international
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The familial position and social status of daughters-in-law (kelins) in
   `traditional' Central Asian families can be characterized as low,
   subservient and marginalized. By adopting normative human rights
   discourse, this paper argues that it is an example of the relativist
   challenge of cultural authenticity towards the universality of human
   rights, specifically women's human rights. By using participant
   observation which can also be qualified as experiential research, serial
   in-depth and informal interviews, and an analysis of posts published in
   social media, the forces driving the persistence of a relativist
   approach to kelins' human rights such as retraditionalization, the
   revival of conservative Islam, an unawareness of the human rights and
   the patterns of authority-subordination are explored. Through a
   conceptual framework combining Iris Young's concept of the `five faces
   of oppression' and the notion of `harmful traditional practices',
   elaborated by international human rights documents, the study
   conceptualizes the family position and social status of the kelins as
   one of structural oppression or systemic injustice, created and
   legitimized by informal, harmful traditional norms and practices.},

Abstract = {In 1937, Soviet Koreans from the Far East were forcibly relocated by
   Stalin to Central Asia. This narrative of expulsion and deportation is
   used to explain the residence of Koreans in present-day Kazakhstan,
   Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. First, this article maps out the
   historical backdrop that has broadly shaped the Kazakhstani Korean
   experience. Exploring the lived experiences of Central Asian Koreans
   then elucidates the heterogeneity which exists within this diasporic
   community. It is this heterogeneity that provides insight into how
   people navigated the central control of the Soviet apparatus and has
   shaped intergenerational attitudes about language and identity of this
   diasporic community. Subsequently, this article explores 26 Korean
   interviewees' language attitudes, practices, and ideologies as they are
   situated in their historic diasporic narratives. More broadly, this
   article problematizes how diasporas are understood in post-Soviet
   contexts and the importance of historical narratives in challenging
   homogenizing nation-state discourses.},

Title = {Climate-driven change of nitrogen retention-attenuation near irrigated
   fields: multi-model projections for Central Asia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification in semiarid regions comes at a cost of
   relatively high water losses through evapotranspiration and can
   contribute to releases of nutrients and pesticides that affect
   downstream water quality. In addition, highly managed river basins may
   be particularly sensitive to future climate change. However, effects on
   retention-attenuation of nutrients are difficult to quantify due to the
   complexity and variability of relevant processes. We here use the
   example case of the large (covering 1.3\% of the earth's land surface)
   and extensively irrigated Aral Sea Drainage Basin (ASDB) in Central
   Asia, together with 73 general circulation model (GCM) projection
   results and field-data driven nitrogen retention-attenuation modeling,
   to investigate to which extent projected future climate change (for
   years 2025, 2050 and 2100) can influence nitrogen loads and
   concentrations in the water systems of the basin. Results for the
   principal Amu Darya River of the ASDB suggest that riverine
   concentrations of nitrogen will decrease considerably throughout the
   coming century. This is due to projected climate-related decreases in
   runoff and river discharge, which increases internal nitrogen
   recirculation ratios, average transport distances and nitrogen
   retention-attenuation. However, in groundwater near the agricultural
   fields, there is in contrast a risk of considerable nitrogen
   accumulation. More generally, the sensitivity of nitrogen concentrations
   in the ADRB to climate-driven changes in runoff and discharge is likely
   to be shared with many highly managed basins in arid and semiarid
   regions of Central Asia, and the world.},

   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {474-489},
Abstract = {This article considers the political uses of conspiracy theories (CTs).
   It is widely accepted that post-Soviet citizens are prone to believe
   CTs, but there has been little research about the conditions under which
   politicians endorse conspiracy narratives and why those narratives
   sometimes become hegemonic. I argue that in times of high uncertainty,
   CTs have properties that are useful in providing political elites with a
   focal point for coordination in the absence of other bases for coalition
   formation. I demonstrate this logic by analyzing the politics
   surrounding the construction and spread of a conspiracy narrative
   following violence in Kyrgyzstan in 2010. Politicians with different
   interpretations of the event coalesced around a contrived conspiratorial
   narrative, and used it to paper over differences as they formed a ruling
   coalition. This argument has implications for how to understand the
   appearance and durability of conspiracy claims in states where political
   formations are fluid.},

Journal = {Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {39-42},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Kyrgyz government declared a policy of ``zero tolerance{''} for
   torture and began reforms to stop such practice, a regular occurrence in
   the country's daily life. This study presents the results of 10 forensic
   evaluations of individuals alleging torture; they represent 35\% of all
   criminal investigations into torture for the January 2011-July 2012
   period. All individuals evaluated were male with an average age of 34
   years. Police officers were implicated as perpetrators in all cases. All
   individuals reported being subjected to threats and blunt force trauma
   from punches, kicks, and blows with objects such as police batons. The
   most common conditions documented during the evaluations were traumatic
   brain injury and chronic seizures. Psychological sequelae included
   post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, which was
   diagnosed in seven individuals. In all cases, the physical and
   psychological evidence was highly consistent with individual allegations
   of abuse. These forensic evaluations, which represent the first ever to
   be conducted in Kyrgyzstan in accordance with Istanbul Protocol
   standards, provide critical insight into torture practices in the
   country. The evaluations indicate a pattern of brutal torture practices
   and inadequate governmental and nongovernmental forensic evaluations.

Journal = {ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-366},

Abstract = {The failure of regionalism in Central Asia is a puzzle. Whereas almost
   all world regions have seen a rise of regional organisations since the
   end of the Cold War, attempts to establish durable regional cooperation
   among Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
   proofed unsuccessful. Although some of the Central Asian countries
   participate in wider regional organisations like the Eurasian Economic
   Union (EAEU) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the
   genuine Central Asian Cooperation Organisation (CACO) was dissolved in
   2005. Given the cultural, economic and political similarities between
   the five Central Asian countries, this lack of a regional organisation
   is surprising. In contrast to previous work, this paper argues that the
   failure of regionalism in Central Asia is not so much due to domestic
   political factors, but more to the extra-regional economic dependence of
   the regional economies and the impact of external powers within Central
   Asia. Challenged by the rise of China, Russia uses the EAEU in order to
   preserve its hegemonic influence over the former Soviet Republics. By
   joining the Russian dominated EAEU, Central Asia's regional power
   Kazakhstan enjoys economic benefits which outweigh the potential gains
   of Central Asian cooperation within CACO by far. Consequently,
   Kazakhstan follows its extra-regional interests in closer cooperation
   with Russia at the cost of regional cooperation with its Central Asian
   neighbours. As a result, the Central Asian countries are unable to build
   up a unified regional block in relation to extra-regional powers like
   China or Russia.},

Title = {Human and Natural Impacts on the Water Resources in the Syr Darya River
   Basin, Central Asia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Water resources are increasingly under stress in Central Asia because
   downstream countries are highly dependent on upstream countries. Water
   is essential for irrigation and is becoming scarcer due to climate
   change and human activities. Based on 20 hydrological stations, this
   study firstly analyzed the annual and seasonal spatial-temporal changes
   of the river discharges, precipitation, and temperature in the Syr Darya
   River Basin and then the possible relationships between these factors
   were detected. Finally, the potential reasons for the river discharge
   variations have been discussed. The results show that the river
   discharges in the upper stream of the basin had significantly risen from
   1930 to 2006, mainly due to the increase in temperature (approximately
   0.3 degrees C per decade), which accelerated the melting of glaciers,
   while it decreased in the middle and lower regions due to the rising
   irrigation. In the middle of the basin, the expansion of the
   construction land (128.83 km(2)/year) and agricultural land (66.68
   km(2)/year) from 1992 to 2015 has significantly augmented the water
   consumption. The operations of reservoirs and irrigation canals
   significantly intercepted the river discharge from the upper streams,
   causing a sharp decline in the river discharges in the middle and lower
   reaches of the Syr Darya River in 1973. The outcomes obtained from this
   study allowed us to understand the changes in the river discharges and
   provided essential information for effective water resource management
   in the Syr Darya River Basin.},

Title = {The modern silk road: trade in Persian opium across Central Asia in the
   long nineteenth century},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES},
Abstract = {This article focuses on an overlooked chapter in the history of
   commercial relations between Iran and China. The article shows how
   Persian opium was taken to Central Asia before it was distributed across
   the Han interior for much of the nineteenth century. Historical caravan
   routes and long-established networks of commercial interests served to
   facilitate this cross-continental exchange. The article argues that such
   overland trade was important for unleashing globalizing processes that
   are often discussed in the context of the history of opium, capitalism,
   and commercial relations in the Indian Ocean world. This article, in
   brief, decentres the history of modern trade and economy in Asia by
   discussing the role of non-European traders, commodities, supply chains,
   and networks in the development of the globalized commercial and
   economic order in Asia.},

   ECONOMIES},
Series = {Advances in Health Economics and Health Services Research},

Pages = {83-106},
Abstract = {Objective - The implications of social health insurance (SHI) for labor
   markets have featured prominently in recent debates over the merits of
   SHI and general revenue financing. It has been argued that by raising
   the nonwage component of labor costs, SHI reduces firms' demand for
   labor, lowers employment levels and net wages, and encourages
   self-employment and informal working arrangements. At the national
   level, SHI has been claimed to reduce a country's competitiveness in
   international markets and to discourage foreign direct investment (FDI).
   The transition from general revenue finance to SHI that occurred during
   the 1990s in many of the central and eastern European and central Asian
   countries provides a unique opportunity to investigate empirically these
   claims.
   Methodology/approach - We employ regression-based generalizations of
   difference-in-differences (DID) and instrumental variables (IV) on
   country-level panel data from 28 countries for the period 1990-2004.
   Findings - We find that, controlling for gross domestic product (GDP)
   per capita, SHI increases (gross) wages by 20\%, reduces employment (as
   a share of the population) by 10\%, and increases self-employment by
   17\%. However, we find no significant effects of SHI on unemployment
   (registered or self-reported), agricultural employment, a widely used
   measure of the size of the informal economy, or FDI.
   Implications for policy - We do not claim that our results imply that
   SHI adoption everywhere must necessarily reduce employment and increase
   self-employment. Nonetheless, our results ought to serve as a warning to
   those contemplating shifting the financing of health care from general
   revenues to a SHI system.},

   assesses the changes brought by the dynamics of a rising Chinese power
   projection as manifested through its Belt and Road Initiative in the

Abstract = {China and Russia both have interests in bordering Central Asia. China's
   thirst for energy has seen its footprint expand rapidly in the region
   relative to that of Russia, Central Asia's historical hegemon. With the
   two powerful neighbors' history of competition and conflict, the shift
   in relative influence between them risks a resurgence of bilateral
   rivalry. Referencing the scholarly literature on strategic rivalry, this
   article examines how energy relations have helped shaped the trajectory
   of China-Russian relations in Central Asia, particularly after the shock
   that came with the collapse of oil and gas prices in 2008-2009.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {278-288},

Abstract = {Metallogenic specialization of sedimentary cover in Central Asia is
   determined by its tectonic setting that governs the hydrodynamic regime
   (exfiltrational or infiltrational) and as a consequence, the
   hydrogeochemical zonality (type of water and its gaseous and
   microcomponent composition). Hydrodynamic conditions (distribution of
   recharge and discharge areas) determine the direction of stratal water
   flow and location of mineralization resulted from the change in
   geochemical, thermodynamic, lithological, structural and other
   conditions. The exfiltrational regime suggests a dependence of the
   epigenetic mineralization upon the distribution and degree of
   preservation of hydrocarbon occurrences. Often, hydrocarbon matter
   serves as a reducing barrier and ore-concentrating factor during the
   formation of polymineral concentrations related to stratal oxidation
   zone. The supergene epigenetic ore-forming processes are induced by the
   interaction between the Earth's sedimentary cover and hydrosphere.
   Sedimentary rocks themselves commonly serve as a source of ore
   materials. The ore deposition zones on geochemical barriers and ore
   material source are often located significantly apart from each other.
   The trend of these processes is determined by the position of
   ore-bearing depressions in large tectonic blocks.},

Abstract = {Central Asian water management has always been linked to energy and
   security politics. The region is abundant in water as well as in natural
   energy sources. However, distribution of these resources is a steady
   reason for quarrel within the region. In particular, the usage of
   mutually shared waterways creates tensions between different nation
   states. The five Central Asian republics Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
   Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan seek energy independence and try
   to consolidate their position within this geopolitically important
   region. Despite their complex interdependencies, which affect all
   important social, economic, political and security relevant matters,
   Central Asian national states have initiated a disintegration process in
   the region. Economic crises after decades of mutual dependence make the
   region dependent on foreign investments. Within this complex setting,
   managing transboundary waters becomes a sensitive task that seems
   impossible to be resolved by the affected players themselves. Central
   Asian water management reaches beyond the borders of the region and has
   long become an international concern. This article analyzes how foreign
   geopolitical interests shape regional water management, and how capacity
   building measures can lead to sustainable management from within the
   region.},

Abstract = {This study examines the influence of social networks on household
   decisions to emigrate from rural Central Asia. It identifies the peer
   effects of social networks by using a unique and detailed dataset
   derived from the author's field survey in a rural village in a post
   Soviet Central Asian country. Extended versions of spatial
   autoregressive models are then estimated by using the generalized
   spatial two-stage least squares method. The empirical results suggest
   that peer effects positively influence household decisions to emigrate,
   whereas network position does not. It is suggested the existence of
   intense social networks, which can be sources of spillover effects,
   might increase migration from the village society. Journal of

Title = {Exploring the changes and driving forces of water footprint in Central
   Asia: A global trade assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {375},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Central Asia is a strategic geopolitical region, which has recently been
   identified to be on the verge of a water -related crisis. Yet, most
   studies addressing water-related issues across Central Asia have lacked
   multi-sectoral and cross-country perspectives. This study used the
   multi-region input-output model to quantify the water footprint in
   Central Asia as well as the STIRPAT technique to study its driving
   forces from 1995 to 2015. The results revealed that the production and
   consumption-based water footprints of Central Asia sharply increased, as
   proven by the growth rate of 12.69 x 109 m3/annum and 9.52 x 109
   m3/annum, respectively. The water -intensive agriculture sector
   completely dominated Central Asia's water footprint. In addition,
   between 1995 and 2015, the volume of imported and exported water
   footprints in Central Asia increased. In terms of exports, the internal
   water footprint accounted for 3\%-5\%, whereas the external accounted
   for 95\%-97\%. With respect to imports, the internal water footprint
   dropped from 50\% to 37\%. Nevertheless, the gap between export and
   import volumes was approximately ten-fold, which revealed that
   international trade exacerbates Central Asia's water crisis.
   Furthermore, urbanisation was revealed to have significant positive
   effect on water footprint changes compared to population, gross domestic
   product (GDP) and water use efficiency in Central Asia. This study
   provides policy implications for promoting Central Asia's water resource
   management, as well as high-lighting the driving forces of water
   footprint that need attention, resulting in cooperative water resource
   man-agement to promote sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Despite the global nature of domestic violence against women, few
   studies have examined the phenomenon in Kyrgyzstan. This grounded theory
   study gives voice to survivors of domestic violence by examining women's
   experiences of various forms of violence and the complexities
   surrounding Kyrgyz women's decision making about leaving violent
   relationships. Findings revealed that survivors move through a
   three-stage process of leaving: (a) reaching a turning point, (b)
   implementing the leaving process, and (c) reclaiming self. Participants
   described ``turning points{''} as critical events or sudden realizations
   that the violence had become uncontrollable or intolerable, and that the
   problem was not going to be solved without external support. The turning
   points fell into four major categories, including epiphanies and moments
   of truth, losing hope for a change in the abuser's behavior, reaching
   the point of saturation and giving up, and experiencing fear for the
   safety of children and protecting self. The main factor that led women
   to leave was being confronted with the pervasive fear that the abuse
   would lead to permanent disability or death. In the second stage, the
   process of leaving was characterized by an iterative cycle of leaving
   and returning until women were able to weigh the costs and benefits of
   staying and leaving in the face of cultural, institutional, and systemic
   constraints. The final stage of leaving involved ``reclaiming self,{''}
   which was the result of cognitive shifts, finding new meanings in their
   experiences of abuse and attempts to leave, and support received from
   advocates at the shelter. Results have implications for interventions
   with survivors and policies addressing the problem of domestic violence
   in Kyrgyzstan.},

   current social research to identify deficiencies in states' fulfillment
   of their positive duties under international law to address the
   intersections between gender-based discrimination and religion. It
   employs the concept of intersectional discrimination to analyze these
   connections. The connection between FoRB and gender equality from the
   perspective of intersectional discrimination has not been sufficiently
   researched in relation to Central Asia and Russia. The treaty monitoring
   documents are a good starting point for this research and give a
   comprehensive picture of existing legal issues and underlying social

Title = {China's energy diplomacy towards Central Asia and the implications on
   its ``belt and road initiative{''}},
Journal = {PACIFIC REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {490-522},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {China's oil investment in Central Asia from the late 1990s was not
   driven by energy needs or geopolitical ambitions, like many assumed. The
   real concern was the safety of its western boundary, while energy was
   used as an instrument to forge political ties with its neighbours.
   However, China has become one of the key geopolitical players in Central
   Asia after more than 20 years engagement, and many observers are keen to
   find out why has Beijing failed to escape the grand games while focusing
   on energy diplomacy? And, what is the implications of China's new status
   in Central Asia on its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)? This article
   attempts to answer the questions via reviewing China's energy diplomacy
   towards Central Asia, from the lens of geopolitics. Focusing on China's
   dealing with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as well as the Russian factor,
   the research has revealed the main reasons that led China into the grand
   games: the entangling of politics and China's energy engagements; the
   establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization; and the changes
   of the pipeline map. China's geopolitical gains have mainly made at the
   cost of Russia, though the latter chose to accept Beijing's greater
   presence in Central Asia against the changed circumstances. The launch
   of the BRI scheme has amplified China's geopolitical significance in
   Central Asia, but also triggered various criticisms, including the debt
   traps and governance-related issues. China's dealing with the Muslims in
   Xinjiang was also a point of disagreement. Beijing may need to revisit
   its pragmatic featured diplomacy, and to take a more liberal approach to
   accommodate different political perspectives. With greater power
   potential, Beijing should bear more responsibilities to ensure peace and
   stability in Central Asia, together with other powers, not only for the
   sake of BRI's success, but also for the interest of the mankind.},

Abstract = {Post-imperial ethnic identities and divides are often constructed and

   In this study, we use nationally representative survey data to examine
   proficiency, use, and valuation of the Russian language - a major such
   legacy of the Soviet empire - in Kyrgyzstan, a multiethnic Central Asian
   nation with a long and complex history of ethnic and regional cleavages.
   The multivariable analyses produce instructive net variations in Russian
   proficiency and use across regional subgroups of ethnic Kyrgyz, the
   titular ethnicity, and between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, a marginalized ethnic
   minority. The analyses also show that the command and use of Russian
   increase with community ethnic heterogeneity. Yet, no variations along
   these axes are found in the perceived importance of Russian language
   knowledge for success in the domestic labour market. These findings are
   situated within the interconnected contexts of historical
   ethnolinguistic legacies, dynamics of nation-building, and geopolitics.},

Title = {The Current Status and Future of Central Asia's Fish and Fisheries:
   Confronting a Wicked Problem},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Central Asia's arid lowland ecosystems are dependent on water that
   originates in nearby mountains and is carried by rivers to terminal
   lakes and freshwater seas with no outlets to the ocean. Fish
   traditionally thrived in these waterways, but they have become
   increasingly jeopardized by water impoundment and diversion for energy
   and crop production. Fish capture in the five new Central Asian
   republics consequently entered a period of long decline, a trend that
   was accelerated by removal of the centralized controls imposed by the
   former Soviet Union. Production levels have recovered during the past
   decade, but only in some countries. A similar trend is evident with
   aquaculture, which reached its lowest production levels in 2003-2008 but
   now is partially recovering. In both cases, progress is most evident in
   water-deficient Uzbekistan. Fish capture in Kazakhstan's Ili River
   ecosystem, including Kapchagay Reservoir and Lake Balkhash, is now
   dropping precipitously. Effects on the lake's fisheries have been
   magnified by the disproportionate rates of disappearance of valuable
   carp and pike-perch. The interrelationships between water, energy, and
   food underlie these threats to Central Asia's fish and define a classic
   ``wicked problem{''} that must be addressed regionally with explicit
   attention given to fish as important components of the ecosystem. Recent
   developments, although not all positive, give reason for cautious
   optimism that the region's fisheries and aquaculture industries can be
   stabilized.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses China and Russia and the Shanghai Cooperation
   Organisation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian regional organisation
   established in 2001 and consisting of China, Russia and the four Central
   Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. I
   argue that while the two largest members of the SCO are essential to the
   organisation, they at the same time prevent the SCO from becoming a more
   comprehensive regional organisation. Moreover, the actions and presence
   of China and Russia in Central Asia, together with inherently
   inauspicious characteristics of the region when compared to the
   post-Cold War new regionalist thinking, hinder the overall
   regionalisation in the area. However, regionalisation, hopefully in time
   leading to greater regional cooperation in Central Asia, is very much in
   the interests of Europe and the European Union (EU) as a potential
   peaceful way forward in the development of the region.},

Abstract = {Post-Soviet religious dynamics have attracted considerable scholarly
   attention, but their complexities remain poorly understood. Ethnic and
   gender intersections of religious identity and behavior are particularly
   understudied. This study examines these complexities and intersections
   using data of two rounds of a nationally representative survey from
   Kyrgyzstan, a multi-religious and multi-ethnic nation. The multivariable
   analyses of subjective religious salience and religious practice
   produced both expected and unexpected gendered variations by religion,
   ethnicity, and region, as well as instructive temporal trends in these
   variations. The findings are interpreted through the prism of broader
   societal transformations in Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere in post-Communist
   Central Eurasia.},

   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {342-358},
Abstract = {It is often noted in resource curse literature that agricultural
   economies are less conflict-prone than countries managing mobile,
   high-value resources. In the vast literature linking resource endowment
   and conflict, cash crop economies are often considered immune to civil
   violence, believed to stand apart from the many horrific episodes of
   violence and civil war centered on ``lootable'' wealth (such as alluvial
   diamonds, tin, tungsten, or other conflict minerals). But many incidents
   of violence-especially local violence-are in fact occurring in cash crop
   economies. Drawing on newspaper accounts, policy analyses, ethnographic
   interviews, and in-depth reports by international organizations, I
   examine an episode of local violence in 2010 in Kyrgyzstan. Through this
   case study, the article provides a better understanding of local
   violence in cash crop economies that can apply to other weak states.},

Volume = {49},
Pages = {266-272},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Effective and sustainable management of mineral resources is one of the
   key public policy objectives of developing countries. Kyrgyzstan, one of
   ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, is a perfect example which struggles
   forming reliable policies as well as a mining industry after shocking
   political and social movements. In the shadow of several coup d'etat
   attempts, international pressures from regional powers, and ethnic
   clashes, the government has developed vast administration reforms
   regulating social and economic changes besides resource management.
   Policy making in mineral resource management depends upon interim
   governmental establishments, prior use of the locals, and attributes of
   the resource. Mineral-rich Kyrgyzstan's initial and current problems'
   impact on public policies and legislations of resource management
   provides a case study explaining the emergence of such tools. Utilizing
   institutional theory as the theoretical background, the study offers
   perspectives from other Central Asian countries, which contributes to
   comparative policy analysis literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The unique cultural and political history of Central Asia has produced
   intriguing ethnic variations in union formation. We use data from a
   survey of 1,535 young adults conducted in 2005 in northern Kyrgyzstan to
   examine ethnic patterns of entry into marriage versus cohabitation. To
   reflect the historic-cultural and political realities of Kyrgyzstan, we
   subdivide ethnic Kyrgyz into two categories based on the degree of
   linguistic Russification-more-Russified Kyrgyz and less-Russified
   Kyrgyz-and compare them to each other and to respondents of European
   origin. The results of the multinomial discrete-time logit models show
   significant differences among the three groups. Thus, Europeans were
   most likely to enter cohabitation whereas less-Russified Kyrgyz were
   least likely to do so, net of other factors. The three groups were lined
   up in the converse order with respect to probability of entering
   marriage, but upon breakdown by gender this ordering was present only
   among women. In contrast, among men, more-Russified Kyrgyz were less
   likely to marry than both less-Russified Kyrgyz and Europeans. We
   interpret these findings in light of long-term historic-cultural and
   demographic distinctions as well as more recent politically induced
   cleavages in Kyrgyzstan.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the role of industrial policy in the economic
   development of Uzbekistan, which took a gradualist approach in
   transition and continued to record rapid economic growth from the early
   2000s. It stopped depending on cotton monoculture and was able to
   achieve self-sufficiency in grain. It transformed itself from a net fuel
   importer to an exporter. The government promoted the manufacturing
   sector, focusing on the heavy industries, such as the automotive and
   chemical industries. Industrial restructuring in Uzbekistan has been
   supported by the industrial policy. The government has taken several
   industrial policy measures, including tax and financial incentives,
   state orders, policy selectively welcoming foreign direct investment,
   import protection and export promotion, and exchange-rate management.
   This paper provides policy implications for the other developing and
   transition economies pursuing economic development and considers the
   appropriate role of the government.},

Abstract = {Across Eurasia, authoritarian leaders have sought to justify their
   `strong-hand' approach to government by framing instability as a
   security threat and the strong state as a guarantor of political
   stability. Such `regimes of certainty' promote a modernist valorization
   of order, the flip side of which is a demonization of political disorder
   instability, or mere uncertainty. Examining the spatial and temporal
   imaginaries underpinning such narratives about in/stability in Central
   Asia, this paper compares official discourse in Kazakhstan and
   Uzbekistan, where state-controlled media and official publications have
   stigmatized political instability in Kyrgyzstan as indicative of the
   dangers of political liberalization and a weak state. Ostensibly about
   the `other', these narratives are also about scripting the `self'. I
   argue that official interpretations of `disorder over the border' in
   Kyrgyzstan are underpinned by a set of spatial and temporal imaginaries
   that do not merely reflect regional moral geographies, but actively
   construct them.},

Abstract = {There is little knowledge available about entrepreneurship in transition
   economies of Central Asia in comparison to the advanced economies where
   significantly more research information is available about entrepreneurs
   and entrepreneurial process. Despite the lack of information about
   entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship process in transition economies,
   especially about former Soviet Republic countries, it is recognized that
   the effective practice of entrepreneurship is highly correlated with a
   successful transition from a planned economy to a market based economy.
   On the other hand, although there might be cultural similarities between
   Turkish and Kyrgyz entrepreneurs due to historic Turkic ties between the
   two countries, significant differences exists between the two countries
   in terms of economic approach and policies adopted. Turkey has adopted
   market based economic policies right after WWII and has experienced much
   longer period of rapid economic growth compare to Kyrgyzstan. As a
   result, Turkey offers a more positive and mature environment for new
   enterprise development.
   Accordingly, a comparative study of the entrepreneurial attitudes and
   attributes in these two countries that have historically common roots
   and tradition but have followed totally different economic paths should
   prove to provide valuable insights to the researchers and policy makers
   alike. Through an empirical study of Turkish and Kyrgyz entrepreneurs in
   different sectors, this study explores the characteristics and
   attributes of Turkish and Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and their attitudes
   towards entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial process. We also
   explore the motives, challenges encountered, and demographic attributes
   of Turkish and Kyrgyz entrepreneurs. Data for the study is collected in
   both countries using a developed questionnaire translated in both
   languages. A total of 203 usable questionnaires are collected from
   Turkish entrepreneurs and a total of 100 questionnaires are collected
   from Kyrgyz entrepreneurs. Our findings indicate significant differences
   between Turkish and Kyrgyz entrepreneurs in terms of their profiles,
   attitudes, motivations, and environmental conditions of
   entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to explore the interconnections between social identities
   (ethnic, national, regional and religious) and conflict intentions in
   Tajikistan. Based on the analysis of the dynamics of identity-based
   conflicts, the paper emphasizes the importance of an early warning
   system that centers on social identity and shows what impact such
   factors as national identity building, religious identity revival, and
   regional identity reinforcement have on processes of conflict
   prevention, resolution, and reconciliation. Through the examination of
   the components of the model, including such factors as intergroup
   prejudice, outgroup threat, identity salience, ingroup primacy, forms of
   social identity, and modes of identity meaning, the author shows the
   main threats to peaceful co-existence in Tajikistan. (C) 2007 Published

Abstract = {The problems of the growth of public debt affect an increasing number of
   states in the modern world. Most countries record a significant shortage
   of their resources when making domestic investments and cover the state
   budget deficit and carry out socio-economic transformations. This lack
   of funds led to the formation of an economic debt system. At the same
   time, with the liberalization and globalization of financial markets,
   there will be an increase in the dependence of national economies on
   external replenishment. When carrying out economic transformations, most
   of the modern world countries resort to using external and internal
   sources of financing.
   The Kyrgyz Republic is no exception to this rule and today is largely
   dependent on external funding from foreign donors. At the same time, the
   lack of a consistent policy in attracting and using external and
   internal financial resources has led to the formation of significant
   external debt, which does not allow for economic transformations to
   ensure the country's economic security. As a result of this study,
   recommendations were formed for the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz
   Republic, which proposes a balanced policy of attracting expensive
   foreign loans to reduce the debt burden. In this study, the principles
   of dialectical logic, the unity of the logical and the historical, and
   generally scientific methods of cognition were used. Analysis,
   synthesis, consistency, special comparisons, groupings, classifications,
   generalization can be distinguished.},

Pages = {70-82},

Abstract = {This paper studies the experience of foreign-funded programmes aimed at
   establishing participatory forest management (PFM), primarily in the
   walnut-fruit forests of Kyrgyzstan. Having reviewed programme reports,
   non-governmental organization evidence and legislation, we argue that
   the poor performance of these programmes is due largely to incorrect
   starting assumptions about the feasibility of PFM in the Kyrgyz context
   and a lack of analysis about locally appropriate forestry regimes. We
   show that there have been no significant preconditions for realization
   of PFM mechanisms in the history of Kyrgyz forestry, and their
   realization has been hampered by the Soviet legacy, strong informal
   institutions and poverty. We argue that PFM has been introduced without
   a clear understanding of how it fits in the overall vision of the
   country's development. Moreover, PFM is not fit for purpose in
   Kyrgyzstan, as it does not address the root macro-economic and
   environmental causes of existing forestry problems. The capacity of
   local communities should not be over-emphasized where cross-sectoral
   national or even cross-border efforts are required. Mutual, joint
   learning of Western donors with local experts is key, and should not be
   replaced by automatic adoption of imported concepts. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {This article analyses how people in Guliston, southern Tajikistan,
   conceive of `waiting' both for labour-migrants to return from Russia,
   and to realise the projects that these migrants and their families
   envision. In Guliston people talk about two contradictory forms of
   waiting: on the one hand, they associate waiting with sitting and doing
   nothing; on the other, they equally emphasise the active roles they play
   to keep their village full of vitality while they wait for their
   migrant-relatives to return. Stressing the interdependencies between
   temporality and mobility, and the experiences of time and place by those
   who stay in their villages and those who migrate, this article argues
   that people in Guliston practise `waiting' as active and creative
   processes that figure prominently in their production of specific forms
   of sociality and community, and their village as a dynamic place at the
   centre of a circulation of caregiving.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {74},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper applies two hypotheses regarding weak state foreign policy to
   analyze the opportunities and risks in Turkmenistan's quest to diversify
   its gas export routes, especially since 2006. The first hypothesis,
   related to opportunities, is that competition among major powers over
   the allegiance of weak states strengthens their bargaining power. The
   second hypothesis, related to risks, is that the diversification
   policies of weak states in times of decreasing competition among great
   powers incur the danger of simply replacing an old master with a new
   one. I argue that while the first hypothesis is useful in explaining the
   opportunities of Turkmenistan's diversification policies, especially
   before early 2009, the second hypothesis is helpful in accounting for
   the risks of these policies after early 2009. In other words,
   competition among four major powers, Russia, China, the EU, and India,
   over Turkmenistan's gas pipeline system before early 2009 strengthened
   the country's bargaining power. In contrast, Turkmenistan's
   diversification policies in times of fading competition after early 2009
   have left it increasingly exposed to the potential risk of replacing its
   old master, Russia, with a new one, China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article examines the nexus between art and its ideological
   function, both discursively and in practice, in the Soviet socialist
   republics. Scrutinizing the case of visual monumental art in Soviet
   Tajikistan in the 1970s and 1980s, it can be seen that the geographical
   and cultural distance from Moscow, in addition to complex multi-actor
   and multi-level policy implementation channels, allowed for
   non-conventional artistic practices to develop in the Soviet periphery.
   The article highlights the role of local officials and, in particular,
   artists in re-appropriating the official identity formation process with
   specific ideas of ``nationhood,{''} religion, and gender relations,
   while at the same time aspiring to comply with the dominant socialist
   realism doctrine. It is argued that, contrary to the prominent slogan
   ``socialist in content, national in form,{''} artworks produced in the
   Soviet periphery were often socialist in form and ``national{''} in
   content. While the artists skillfully worked within the monumental art
   tradition promoted by the state, thus relying on a socialist form, not
   infrequently the meaning of their works distorted, or even contradicted,
   the official ideology. Often this subversion was non-deliberate.
   Ultimately, however, the artworks ended up strengthening an autonomous
   local agency that policy-makers in Moscow sought to eradicate.},

   that is also informed by government policies and Muslim subjectivities.
   The ethnography highlights bodily sensations such as shaking chills, and
   visceral episodes such as vomiting, fainting, or sensuously-dreaming
   because they materialize the narrative, experience and performativity of
   the qualities of touch. The article advances the notion that touch
   pertains not only to both physical immediacy and intimate closeness, but
   also to processes of physical separation and estrangement between two or

   education and is controlled for demographic and locational variables.
   Education. region, ethnicity, and family size are all significant
   determinants of expenditure, but the model's explanatory power is
   stronger in 1996 than at the start of the transition in 1993. The costs
   of dependents became larger; an extra child was a greater economic
   burden than an extra pensioner, especially in poorer households. The
   education results are more difficult to interpret; the estimated returns
   declined between 1993 and 1996, but better educated heads appear to have
   moved their households up in terms of the income distribution. (C) 2000

Abstract = {As the discourse around societal cohesion grows and policy makers
   increasingly turn their attention towards improving cohesion,
   understanding its role for the lives of individuals becomes ever more
   important. Our study examines whether the social cohesion of the
   immediate living context is related to the strength of Big Five
   personality traits among individuals. Using data from a community survey
   of 6252 adults living in 30 rural sub-districts in the Kyrgyz Republic,
   where social cohesion is a sizable policy concern, we conduct a
   multilevel analysis of the relationship between sub-district cohesion
   and individual personality. Results indicate that higher levels of
   cohesion are significantly related to higher individual levels of
   agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. However, no relationship
   is found with extraversion or neuroticism. Thus, where a social entity
   has higher cohesion, this entity will also have inhabitants with a
   greater prosocial and communal orientation towards others, greater
   conscientiousness and more openness to experience. These findings imply
   that social cohesion may be one geographical social indicator related to
   variation in personality traits. Moreover, the findings suggest that
   understanding social cohesion requires both macro- and
   micro-perspectives and that its connection to these particular
   personality traits should be taken into consideration.},

Abstract = {Labor migration has surged in the former Soviet countries such as
   Kyrgyzstan because of multiple crises that the country faced since the
   collapse of the Soviet Union. Migration has produced broad impacts on
   most aspects of life in Kyrgyzstan and is transforming family life in
   myriad ways. Based on in-depth interviews with members of migrating
   families, this study explores the impact of labor migration on families
   from Kyrgyzstan and identifies issues that arise at the intersection of
   migration and family life. The experiences of migrants and their family
   members were examined (N= 20). The results revealed that decisions of
   who would migrate were made jointly among extended families and were
   driven by economic needs. Migration incurred number of trade-offs and
   challenges for families, especially separation of family members and
   additional responsibilities placed on those who remain at home. The
   study contributes to our understanding of the family level consequences
   of labor migration, providing a nuanced picture of the benefits and
   compromises for families.},

Title = {Income-based projections of water footprint of food consumption in

Abstract = {Assessing future water requirements for feeding the growing population
   of Central Asia can improve understanding of the projected water supply
   scenarios in the region. Future water requirements will be partially
   determined by the dietary habits of the populations, and are thus
   responsive to significant variation of income levels. Using Uzbekistan
   as an example, this study projects the water footprints of income driven
   changes on the population's diet in Central Asia. To reveal the
   influence of large income changes on dietary habits a Normalized
   Quadratic-Quadratic Expenditure System was calibrated and applied to
   data from 2009. The national water footprints of food consumption in
   Uzbekistah were projected until 2034 by applying the parameterized
   demand system to estimate the respective water footprint values. The
   results showed that for Uzbekistan the projected increase in the food
   consumption water footprint would be primarily linked to income growth
   rather than population growth. Due to the high water footprint of common
   food products, the composition of the population's diet, and
   responsiveness to income, economic growth is expected to put greater
   pressure on water resources in Uzbekistan unless proper measures are
   undertaken. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Crude `Oil Mercantilism'? Chinese Oil Engagement in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {PACIFIC AFFAIRS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {257-280},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In 1991, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
   commenced the first Chinese national oil company equity oil investment
   overseas when it invested in a UN-sponsored oil sands project in Canada.
   Since then, the CNPC and the other Chinese national oil companies
   (Sinopec and the CNOOC) have steadily increased their equity oil
   investments in developing nations, sometimes with the assistance of
   various Chinese party and government organs. Viewed in the context of
   China's burgeoning oil consumption and plateauing oil production, these
   investments have led to accusations by Western analysts and policy
   makers that China is engaging in ``mercantilism{''} by ``locking up{''}
   oil supplies from vulnerable developing nations to assuage their
   mounting energy-security woes.
   Through examining Chinese oil engagement in Kazakhstan, this paper will
   analyze whether accusations of ``mercantilism{''} can adequately capture
   the complexities and dynamics that drive Chinese oil company investment
   in developing nations. This will be achieved by first surveying
   contemporary debates regarding Chinese oil engagement abroad and then
   linking these debates to historical and contemporary conceptualizations
   of mercantilism. This will allow for a new multi-faceted definition of
   ``oil mercantilist{''} behaviour, which will shift the label from a
   statement of ethical value to a statement of empirical fact that can be
   tested. This definition will then be used to examine the institutional
   contexts in China that support and counter contemporary accusations of
   oil mercantilism, and then to explore Chinese oil engagement in
   Kazakhstan from 1996 to the present day. This paper will contribute to
   emerging literature that suggests Chinese oil investment and diplomacy
   cannot be simply understood through mercantilist perspectives. Analyses
   of Chinese oil engagement need to recognize the important influence that
   China's institutional reforms have had on Chinese national oil
   companies' increasingly commercial approach to foreign investment, in
   addition to the unique host-country contexts China encounters through
   its oil investments.},

   authors argue that those measures can be instrumental in fostering
   growth. Uzbekistan has applied heterodox distortive measures in

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, it analyses the
   relationship between educational level, the school-to-work transition
   period for youth and positions which suffer from an education-job
   mismatch in Kyrgyzstan; and second, it investigates the effect of the
   education-job mismatch on the wages of youth in Kyrgyzstan.
   Design/methodology/approach The study uses the International Labor
   Organization 2013 data from the school-to-work transition survey for
   Kyrgyzstan. The Kaplan-Meier failure analysis is employed to demonstrate
   the relationship between school-to-work transition and mismatch status.
   To investigate the effect of an education-job mismatch on wages, a
   Mincer-type equation with OLS estimations is used. Along with this,
   taking into consideration potential unobserved heterogeneity issue, a
   propensity score matching method is applied. Findings The results
   indicate a large difference between those with tertiary education and
   those with non-tertiary education in terms of the probability of being
   employed with a wrong match. Young individuals without tertiary
   education are more likely to be employed with a right match. Analysis of
   the impact of overeducation on wages shows that the impact of
   overeducation depends on how it is measured. According to the objective
   approach, overeducated male individuals receive low wages compared to
   well matched, but estimation results based on the total sample of
   subjective approach indicate the positive effects of overeducation on
   wage. Originality/value This paper contributes to the existing
   literature on the school-to-work transition and overeducation by
   focusing on one of the transition economies, which has been largely
   neglected by the literature.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of the drug trade on security and
   stability in Tajikistan. In order to capture the multifaceted nature of
   this relationship, the effects on territory, population, state
   institutions, and the idea of the state are examined. The types of
   threats affecting these components of the state are discussed. These
   include societal security in the form of addiction and drug-related
   diseases; the military threat, most notably manifested by the merger of
   crime and terror; economic and political threats resulting from a
   criminalised economic and political system; and the relationship between
   the drug trade and the legitimacy of the state.},

Abstract = {Why would a woman agree to wed a legally married man when the state
   would neither recognize her marriage nor grant her alimony, child
   support or inheritance rights? Although the Communist Party curtailed
   the rate of openly acknowledged polygynous marriages among the Kyrgyz,
   its work was undone by glasnost and perestroika, which ushered in a
   permissive environment. This article highlights constructions of gender
   as a driver of polygyny in Kyrgyzstan from the perspective of women who
   voluntarily become second wives. The Kyrgyz case suggests that the
   cultural value of marriage and motherhood - traditions that grant women
   communal identities, power and prestige - might lead a woman to consent
   to second-wife status. I employ the concept of motivational
   interconnectivity, defined as two or more related reasons women make
   important personal decisions that have societal repercussions, to
   explain a woman's decision to become a second wife.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Despite the extensive literature on the nexus between civil society and
   democratization in non-democratic regimes, most existing scholarship
   focuses on politically oriented and claim-making civil society
   organizations. While these accounts provide useful insights, they appear
   to rely on Western-centric understandings of civil society. Undoubtedly,
   little space exists in non-democratic regimes within which civil society
   organizations may engage in overt political activism due to governmental
   restrictions. Notwithstanding these restrictions, there are politically
   less threatening social arenas, where it is possible to identify
   informally organized civil society initiatives with the potential to
   redefine and influence long-term state-society relations. This article
   argues that what we might think of as civil society initiatives in
   non-democratic regimes cannot be satisfactorily understood through the
   lens of Western-centric understandings of civil society. Instead, we
   should focus on informal civil society initiatives. These processes will
   be illustrated through the case study of mahalla institutions in
   Uzbekistan.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN LAW},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-134},
Abstract = {Against the framework of international human rights law, this article
   studies the regulatory approach towards the exercise of the human right
   to freedom of expression on the Internet in the legal system of the
   Central Asian state of Uzbekistan. The mechanisms of state censorship of
   Internet communication for Uzbek citizens and the restrictions that
   narrow the scope of freedom of expression in the context of the Internet
   are the issues in focus. The article argues that the Uzbek government,
   although publicly committed to democracy and respect for the rule of law
   under the Constitution, favors regulation that undermines the human
   right to freedom of expression on both legal and ideological
   grounds-namely, by enforcing the legal rules on information security and
   the ideological `idea of national independence'. The article
   demonstrates that the absence of legal guarantees of the effective
   exercise of freedom of expression on the Internet reflects upon the
   general weakness of Uzbekistan's domestic system of human rights
   protection. This system gives absolute priority to state interests in
   legitimizing restrictions upon human rights. The article concludes that
   the impairment of the right to freedom of expression is inevitable in
   Uzbekistan unless the government makes an effort to pay full respect to
   human rights and implement in practice its obligations under
   international human rights law.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurship is essential in contributing to economic growth, job
   creation, technological advances, etc. in all countries, including
   Kazakhstan. Hence, the purpose of this study was to find out how to
   further facilitate the development of (foreign) entrepreneurship in
   Kazakhstan. In doing so, the authors attempted to identify factors
   influencing entrepreneurial intention (EI), specifically among the
   foreigners in Kazakhstan, and highlight the role of government support
   (GS) in general and under COVID-19. The study conceptualized the
   extended ``TPB + Moderator (GS){''} model. The hypotheses were tested on
   a sample of 362 new and established foreign entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan
   by means of descriptive analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, and
   multiple regression analysis. The study found that the foreigners'
   personal attitude (PA) toward entrepreneurship was the strongest factor
   motivating their EI, followed by their perceived behavioral control
   (PBC) as the second strongest factor. The role of GS strengthened each
   effect of PA and PBC on EI. The moderating effect of GS and PA is
   greater than that of GS and PBC; each of the moderating effects is lower
   in magnitude than each of the direct effects. Their subject norms (SNs)
   and the moderating effect of GS and SNs are both insignificant.},

Abstract = {Through the case study of Soviet and post-Soviet Almaty (the former
   capital of Kazakhstan), this article considers how the idea of rational
   planning was bolstered in the Soviet era by a belief in universalizing
   approaches and the primacy of scientific truth over local ethics and
   knowledge. However, in practice, plans were rarely implemented. A
   succession of contingent events left city officials caught between an
   immediate necessity for basic shelter and grand plans for quite
   different futures. This also revealed the tension between rationality as
   the goal of harmony between man and nature, and rationality as the means
   to get there. Many citizens believed harmony had in fact been destroyed
   by statist intervention. The revolutionary logic - supposedly natural
   laws framing rationality - appeared again after the end of the Soviet
   period. This time, however, the inverse resulted. The emergence of the
   market was retrospectively rationalized through the bureaucratic form as
   an inescapable result of historical determinism.},

Abstract = {The information in government web sites, which are widely adopted in
   many countries, must be accessible for all people, easy to use, accurate
   and secure. The main objective of this study is to investigate the

   in Kyrgyz Republic. The analysis of web government pages covered 55
   sites listed in the State Information Resources of the Kyrgyz Republic
   and five government web sites which were not included in the list.
   Analysis was conducted using several automatic evaluation tools. Results
   suggested that government web sites in Kyrgyz Republic have a usability
   error rate of 46.3 \% and accessibility error rate of 69.38 \%. The
   study also revealed security vulnerabilities in these web sites.
   Although the ``Concept of Creation and Development of Information
   Network of the Kyrgyz Republic{''} was launched at September 23, 1994,
   government web sites in the Kyrgyz Republic have not been reviewed and
   still need great efforts to improve accessibility, usability and

   ``Characteristics of workers with a special social status{''}. We
   analysed the essence of the method of differentiation of labour
   legislation, which affects the establishment of special working
   conditions for women and workers with family responsibilities. We
   suggested a correlation between the content of legal norms and the level
   of guarantees of gender equality in the labour market The results show
   that family circumstances, gender equality are factors influencing the
   formation of labour legislation, state policy in the field of wage
   labour. The creation of a favourable environment for labour relations of
   the considered categories of workers should be carried out through
   labour contracts, acts of the employer, social partnership agreements,
   collective agreements. However, priority should be given to normative
   acts of national action. Ensuring gender equality in fact always
   requires the implementation of special measures by the employer, which
   must be guaranteed by a coercive state mechanism. At least this thesis
   is true for the conditions of Kazakhstan, a country with a transition
   economy, when business does not have high social activity, and state
   power is in a period of transformation. Importance should be given to
   the monitoring and implementation of international obligations in the
   field of ensuring the prohibition of discrimination, the implementation
   of best practices and standards. The post-Soviet law of Kazakhstan
   recognises the priority of international law over national law, and this
   channel should be maximally used to promote the value of gender
   equality.},

Title = {Rebound Effects in Irrigated Agriculture in Uzbekistan: A
   Stakeholder-Based Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is wide consensus among scholars and practitioners that improved
   irrigation technologies increase farm productivity and improve resource
   use efficiency. However, there is also growing empirical evidence that
   efficiency improvements in irrigation water use may create rebound
   effects, i.e., they may trigger changes in farmers' behavior that partly
   or fully offset the technical water savings expected under ceteris
   paribus conditions. In extreme cases, total water consumption may even
   increase. We studied the impacts of introducing water-saving irrigation
   technologies in Uzbekistan and used structured stakeholder interviews
   for an expert-based assessment of potential rebound effects. Our
   findings contribute to the understanding of impacts of technological and
   institutional responses to environmental and economic pressures in
   sustaining water resources. The study demonstrates that although the
   objective of increasing irrigation efficiency may be achieved, the
   actual water savings under Uzbek conditions are likely to be reduced due
   to rebound effects. Unless there are effective policy interventions, we
   expect rebound effects through an increase in water supply for crops
   that compensates for current shortages of irrigation water availability,
   an increase in irrigated area, a switch to more water-intensive crops,
   and overall economic growth. The findings of this paper provide a
   reference point for estimating the water-saving potential and for
   evaluating and adapting policies.},

Abstract = {Food resource is an important bond that connects human beings and
   nature. In this study, we investigated the changes in food consumption
   and nutrition intake in Kazakhstan from a spatial and temporal
   perspective, from 2001 to 2018. The data were obtained from the Bureau
   of Statistics, international organizations and our social interview
   work. After the start of the 21st century, it was found that per capita
   food consumption significantly increased; however, the consumption of
   crop, vegetables and milk decreased. Per capita meat consumption was
   similar in both urban and rural areas. However, some food consumption
   showed differences between urban and rural areas. Changes of food
   consumption quantity and structure also had some effects on nutrient
   intake and the proportion of nutrients. Per capita energy intake in the
   national, urban and rural areas all increased remarkably. The energy
   intake changes in eastern states increased much more than that in
   western states. Protein intake in rural and urban areas was similar;
   however, the gap between carbohydrates and fat intake in urban and rural
   areas increased. The intake of protein, carbohydrates and fat in
   different states showed the same trend. Food consumption and nutrition
   intake are affected by economic, social and ecological factors.},

   conservation and interpretation of Gulag sites is at best partial,

   ambiguous. This paper considers key heritage sites and museums in
   Kazakhstan and a qualitative case study approach is adopted based on a
   combination of interviews with twenty-four key stakeholders involved in
   the development and operation of Gulag tourism. Direct observations and
   qualitative document analysis of the major national Gulag museums and
   other important Gulag heritage sites was also undertaken. This research
   questions the orthodoxy inherent in the supposed attraction of dark
   tourism sites and seeks to ascertain why domestic and international
   visitation remains low given the scale and importance of the Gulag

Abstract = {The article explores Kyrgyzstan's nation branding through the film
   Kurmanjan Datka: Queen of the Mountains (2014). While focusing on the
   nexus of gender and nation branding, I suggest that the cinematic
   narrative of the importance of women in national history has become an
   additional source for polishing the national image. To test this, I turn
   to the cinematographic plot and analyze the nation-branding activities,
   on the one hand, and the situation of women in independent Kyrgyzstan,
   on the other. First, the article explores how existing patriarchal
   tendencies limit aspirations of Kyrgyz authorities to project an image
   of Kyrgyzstan as democratic, modern, and progressive. This is especially
   evident when a film about a real-life woman hero that challenges the
   patriarchal attitudes becomes a tool of nation branding. Second, the
   article highlights that not only elites but also ordinary citizens can
   engage in nation-branding practices. The article is based on interviews
   with the film's producer and viewers, the heroine's descendants,
   feminist activists, experts on nation branding, and foreign tourists
   during field-work in Bishkek and Osh in Kyrgyzstan in 2017, 2018, and
   2019, as well as on archival data and interviews with film's audiences
   in the United States.},

Abstract = {Governments are reluctant to acknowledge illegal settlements. Ak Jar is
   an illegal settlement on the outskirts of Bishkek. If the settlement
   were formally legalised, its residents would receive property documents
   as well as recognition and inclusion. They have thus developed
   strategies to achieve the legalisation of Ak Jar. Although the
   settlement is technically illegal, by behaving `legally' (that is,
   following legal norms and practices), the residents and community
   leaders generate the appearance and even some of the effects of legality
   (such as, legitimate power supply, recognition by politicians). This
   creates a halfway space between `legal' and `illegal' that moves the
   settlement away from `full' illegality and closer to legalisation.},

Abstract = {This paper explores Human Resource Management (HRM) practices in

   utilised a questionnaire-based survey, secondary data and interviews
   with HR managers. The paper concludes that HRM and employee relations

   approaches (US and European), and also provided are some implications

Abstract = {No country in the world has achieved full gender equality in labour
   relations. Kazakhstan has just begun a long way of creating legislative
   and organizational conditions for equality in the workplace. It is
   obvious that to create a more equal, gender-sensitive society, a state
   will require profound changes in perceptions, attitudes, stereotypes,
   and laws. Facilitating such changes is justified not only from a moral
   but also from an economic point of view. Today, the requirements for
   women in society in the performance of labour functions are the same as
   for men. However, in family and domestic relations, there is a
   persistence of the gender stereotype of male privileges. There is no
   change in sectoral gender segregation. Women still make up more than
   70\% of employees in the health, education, and social services sectors,
   while women's representation in the financial and public sectors is
   slightly more than half. Traditionally, these types of sectors are less
   profitable compared to ``male industries,{''} such as construction, oil
   and gas, mining, and transport. The level of attracting female labour in
   innovative, infrastructural, and high-tech projects and programs is very
   low. The issue of expanding the economic opportunities of rural women,
   who are denied access to public and state resources and services,
   remains relevant. In the article, we show the possibilities for ensuring
   equal employment of men and women in Kazakhstan. The proposals on the
   improvement of legislation on labour protection and labour conditions
   and improvement of working conditions are presented, and the
   possibilities of introducing and expanding flexible forms of employment
   are considered. Conclusions are drawn on the revision of the list of
   works prohibiting the use of female labour and ensuring that women have
   access to types of work that do not pose a danger to women's health due
   to their automation, technologization, and informatization.},

Title = {IWRM and the Politics of Scale: Rescaling Water Governance in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Over the last two decades, politics of scale and rescaling processes in
   relation to water have been debated by several scholars, especially by
   geographers and political ecologists, who emphasized their
   socio-political nature and their interactions with the environment. By
   contributing to this debate, this paper analyses rescaling processes in
   water governance in relation to the implementation politics of
   Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Uzbekistan. IWRM and
   related initiatives were promoted worldwide, especially in the ``Global
   South{''}. These initiatives proposed the shift in water governance from
   administrative to hydrographic, or river basin, units. Empirically, the
   analysis focuses on the Middle Zeravshan valley in Uzbekistan, where
   IWRM was promoted as a part of post-Soviet water reforms. The analysis
   demonstrates that rescaling water governance towards IWRM and
   hydrographic units is inherently political. The evidence shows that the
   process is deeply interlinked with interests and power of Uzbek
   hydraulic bureaucracies at multiple scales. Firstly, the IWRM sponsored
   establishment of hydrographic units coincided with a recentralization of
   water management, supported by national hydraulic bureaucracies.
   Secondly, the design of the hydrographic unit and related boundaries in
   the Middle Zeravshan valley was driven by controversial multi-scalar
   power dynamics and relations between national and province levels, which
   emphasized the complexity and the multi-scalar nature of rescaling
   processes rooted in Post-Soviet political transformations.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {78-97},
Abstract = {Uzbekistan contains all the ingredients that observers have long argued
   would lead to not only regime change but civil war: economic, political
   and religious repression. Despite the presence of these factors, the
   autocratic regime in Uzbekistan has remained remarkably stable in the
   face of revolutions in neighbouring countries. This article suggests
   three complementary reasons why the regime has remained firm as others
   crumbled around it, including relatively strong economic performance,
   state capacity to repress revolutionary aspirations and government
   co-optation of local institutions. Understanding autocratic stability
   requires that we move beyond the `agency-structure' debates that pervade
   the literature on post-communist institutional development toward a more
   encompassing explanation that recognizes how institutional and
   structural factors both liberate and constrain individual choices.},

   \textbackslash{}nPolitical Settlement in Post-Conflict Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-95},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article engages critically with recent literature on political
   settlements through a case study of inter-ethnic conflict in southern
   Kyrgyzstan. The case study traces how a new political settlement emerged
   in the aftermath of conflict, despite a rejection of international
   proposals on conflict resolution. Instead, local elites constructed an
   exclusionary form of social order, forged through dispossession and
   violence, maintained by informal institutions of patronage and
   clientage. The article explains why this new political settlement
   appeared remarkably resilient, despite its failure to address
   traditional liberal concerns regarding transitional justice and minority
   grievances. The case study highlights two major problems with the
   political settlements literature. First, it contests a widespread
   conceptualisation of political settlements as indicating a cessation of
   conflict, instead pointing to how a political settlement can be
   initiated and maintained through different forms of violence. Second, it
   questions notions of inclusivity in political settlements, noting that
   many political settlements combine logics of both inclusion and
   exclusion. In many cases, they are marked by exclusionary, authoritarian
   practices that together constitute a form of `illiberal peace'. These
   findings caution against a simplistic use of political settlements
   theory to inform policies aimed at resolving internal conflicts.},

Pages = {135-155},
Abstract = {Aim of the study: In this study, it is aimed to determine the
   satisfaction and loyalty perceptions of domestic and international
   tourists who receive kumiss treatment within health tourism in
   Kyrgyzstan. In the study, it was also attempted to find answers to some
   questions i.e. where the tourists having kumiss treatment in Kyrgyzstan
   come from, from where (which channel) did those tourists get information
   about kumiss treatment, how much budget they saved for this type of
   treatment and for what purpose they had this treatment. Materials and
   Methods: In the research, the data were collected by questionnaire
   technique from 156 tourists at 9 different accommodation enterprises
   offering kumiss treatment service in Kyrgyzstan. Cronbach's alpha test
   was made to check the reliability of scales used in the research, and
   factor analysis was made to test construct validities. Results:In the
   result of the study, it was determine that more than half of the
   participants were women (57.7\%) and Kyrgyz citizens (58.3\%), and
   mostly the people who were at the age of 51 years or more, received
   kumiss treatment (24.4\%), most participants consist of the people who
   received kumiss treatment for the first time (32.7\%). It was detected
   that the dimension which made participants most pleased were ``dining
   services and satisfaction from facility's employees{''} (arithmetic
   mean: 4.64). Finally, statistically significant and positive relations
   were identified between satisfaction and loyalty perceptions of the
   participants towards accommodation enterprises they had their kumiss
   treatment. Conclusion: Current data reveal that the tourists receiving
   kumiss treatment in accommodation enterprises in Kyrgyzstan were
   generally satisfied and felt a high level of loyalty towards these
   facilities.},

Abstract = {As soon as the economy of Kazakhstan is highly resource-oriented despite
   numerous efforts to change the structure of the national economy,
   constant assessment of the scientific and innovation sphere of the
   country is actual and important. By way of qualitative, quantitative,
   comparative, and descriptive analysis 13 indicators related to science
   and innovations were investigated to define the level of scientific and
   innovative development in Kazakhstan. Science and innovation in
   Kazakhstan are under-financed and state-based financing of innovative
   activities seems to be ineffective, and the innovations are still
   unprofitable. The scientific human capital is affected by ``brain
   drain,{''} when best graduates go into business or leave the country to
   build careers in better financial conditions. Eight indicators are found
   to be universal and comparable for various countries, and can be applied
   with the purpose of defining the level of scientific and innovative
   development of a country or countries. The results of the study can be
   applied by governmental officials for developing policies related to
   science and innovations. The methods, set of indicators, and findings of
   the study can be used by other researchers for investigating and

Abstract = {This paper intends to highlight how the Kazakhs, the indigenous ethnic

   independence from the former Soviet Union, reclassify and remodel their
   self-culture in the new socio-political context. Despite the craving for
   resuscitating the Islamic tradition, shrunk under colonial domination,
   rather the indigenous folklorized Islam came to be classified as a pure
   national tradition under the fear of radical Islamism, causing the
   exclusion of the orthodox Muslims. This paper looks at hijabed Muslim
   women, considered to be outside the reclassified boundary of national
   tradition, and efficiently controlled and marginalized by the discourse
   produced by the ruling powers. The authors include field research and
   interviews from a number of participants, making visible the strategies
   of exclusion and the political narratives constructed around what people

   2004-2016. Karimov also left behind strong macroeconomic fundamentals
   for his successor. Since taking over the presidency in December 2016,
   Shavkat Mirziyoyev has introduced wide-ranging reforms, creating an

Abstract = {The matter of the effectiveness of applying smart technologies in
   agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan will be of interest to the
   academic community, regardless of territorial affiliation. The relevance
   of the research is in the need to inform farmers on the efficiency of
   such technologies and how to use them. Economic valuation, cost-benefit
   analysis were used to compare traditional and digital agricultural
   technologies in grain production. Wealthy farmers from developed
   countries widely use digital technology, reducing operating costs for
   wage labour and productive resources. In this research, the authors
   attempted to prove the hypothesis of significant economic and
   environmental efficiency in the application of precision technologies.
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the results of the application
   of precision farming tools from an economic standpoint, these results
   can contribute to the study of the efficiency of digital technologies at
   the global and local levels. This research displays that with
   application of modern digital technologies in production, under certain
   circumstances, a farm can increase wheat yield by at least 25-30\%.
   Gross profit with traditional technologies in agriculture amounted to 31
   US dollars per hectare, while application of digital technologies
   brought 54 US dollars per hectare.},

Title = {Politicization of e-voting rejection: reflections from Kazakhstan},
Journal = {TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-330},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Despite certain political, organizational, technological and
   socioeconomic benefits that e-voting brings, governments around the
   world are beginning one by one to denounce its further use in the
   electoral process. In this regard, the paper aims to analyze reasons
   that led to the discontinuation of e-voting, resorting to the case of
   Kazakhstan, a transitional post-soviet country, which actively used the
   technology in 2004-2011, as a poster child of the global trend,
   elaborating on key political, socioeconomic, organizational and
   technological risks that could be associated with the possible return of
   this innovation in future elections.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research is based on the combination of context and policy analysis,
   as well as focus groups studies and semi-structured interviews. The
   context analysis was aimed to understand various political and
   socioeconomic benefits in adopting e-voting in Kazakhstan. The policy
   analysis was useful in identifying implementation strategies of the
   government in promoting e-voting. The focus groups were helpful in
   understanding the perspectives of various audiences on e-voting. The
   semi-structured interviews were carried among independent developers in
   regard to the potential software products that could be used to propose
   new solutions in the area, including by experimenting with various
   blockchain platforms.
   Findings
   Analyzing the lessons from Kazakhstan, one can conclude that e-voting
   was introduced and used for several years by authorities in this country
   for certain economic and organizational benefits, but later they had to
   reject it and return to traditional paper ballot due to lack of
   confidence from the non-governmental sector in the capacity of public
   sector to ensure the integrity of e-voting procedures. As a result,
   building trust and applying innovative approaches should be a priority
   for policymakers in the area, if they wish to return to this technology,
   especially in adopting new presumably more reliable solutions based on
   blockchain technologies.
   Research limitations/implications
   The primary data that was collected by the author from field studies
   were indexed, refined and presented in a special matrix in a separate
   section, which were interpreted in the discussion session. These data
   could be used by other scholars for further interpretation and analysis
   in their own studies, setting new research agendas and testing
   hypotheses. This is a single case study research, which is focused on
   the analysis of reasons that led to the denunciation of e-voting in
   Kazakhstan, which results could be extrapolated mostly to similar
   transitional post-totalitarian settings.
   Practical implications
   The study can be used to inform ways of how to improve the current
   e-voting platforms, especially in ensuring better security and
   transparency of the systems, which could be useful for developers who
   work on blockchain-driven solutions.
   Social implications
   The results of the case study research and expert opinions expressed by
   various software developers in the e-government areas, which were
   presented in the paper, could be used by both an academic community and
   practitioners in understanding better a wide range of political,
   organizational, economic, social and technological drivers, risks and
   new opportunities in promoting e-voting technology as a trust generating
   social phenomenon.
   Originality/value
   The paper proposes the first case study of reasons that led to the
   discontinuation of e-voting in the context of such a typical
   transitional, post-totalitarian and post-soviet society as Kazakhstan,
   providing new insights into a wide range of political, regulatory,
   socioeconomic, organizational and technological aspects of related
   policy decision-making and implementation strategies adopted by public
   institutions in this country.},

Abstract = {The everyday life of the city population of North Kazakhstan between the
   year 1920-1930s has been analyzed through the analysis of family and
   social relations of these people. This paper provides an analysis of
   scientific literature covering specific areas of study of everyday life
   of the population of cities of the Soviet Union. Authors have used
   sourced file copies, museum collections of written documents, and
   statistic materials. The authors have reported changes in the
   consciousness of citizens of the Soviet Union which has led to
   modernization of social relations as an example of a city population of
   this region. The authors have come to the conclusion that new forms of
   political organization in the society had impact on the modernization of
   private life, family, marriage and had caused new problems, that
   manifested themselves through the loss of previous family values.},

Abstract = {Scientific research on irrigation in Uzbekistan has produced much
   knowledge on how to raise water use efficiency. However, most of the
   technologies developed have never been adopted by farmers. I consider
   technology as socially constructed and argue that water use research in
   Uzbekistan has been influenced by a discourse that attributes water
   scarcity to unsustainable, inefficient water use. Technologies developed
   to tackle this discursive scarcity often require long-term commitment
   and investment on a field level. In contrast, farmers experience water
   scarcity as a lack of technical, organizational, or sociopolitical water
   control. Under the political risk of losing their land, short-term
   planning dominates over sustainability concerns and farmers invest in
   social relations and a struggle for water with technology that is not
   connected with the land and does not conflict with agricultural norms.
   To develop adoptable solutions to water scarcity for and with farmers,
   scientific research needs to acknowledge local realities more.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {After a swift decline in the 1990s, the countries of Central Asia have
   experienced significant fertility increases over the last 15 years.
   These fertility upturns have remained off the radar of demographers.
   This study examines the recent fertility increase in Kyrgyzstan,
   focusing on fertility development by parity and among the main ethnic
   groups, in order to go beyond classic fertility indicators and national
   averages. Using a sample from the 2009 Census micro-dataset, sibling
   progression ratios were computed using information on the relationships
   and dates of birth of children under the age of 15. The results allow an
   analysis of the fertility increase by identifying the contribution of
   parity and ethnic group. It was found that the fertility increase in
   Kyrgyzstan has been experienced across the main ethnic groups, but their
   respective share in the population of the country has resulted in
   distinct contributions to the increase. Between 2001 and 2009, 82.4\% of
   the fertility increase was due to an increase in the fertility of Kyrgyz
   women. In comparison, Uzbek and Russian women contributed 10.2\% and
   7.4\%, respectively. By accounting for the parity component and ethnic
   factor, this study adds important disaggregated information, not only on
   family-building behaviours, but also on the social dimension, which is
   of prime importance for a better understanding of the demography of
   Central Asia. The study highlights important information on
   family-building behaviours, which are essential for the formulation of
   appropriate and more effective social policies aimed at sustaining
   and/or increasing fertility.},

   European-origin ethnic groups. The multivariate analyses of recent
   survey data show that even after controlling for socioeconomic
   characteristics and social embeddedness Europeans are significantly more
   inclined to migrate than Asians. Whereas no gender differences in
   migration intentions among either group are detected, marriage,
   childbearing, and social capital exhibit distinct ethnic-specific
   effects. Although economic considerations are prevailing stimuli for
   migration in both groups, the results point to the formation of two
   dominant ethnic-specific migration preference types - for temporary
   migration among Asians and permanent migration among Europeans.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper we explore the evidence that would establish that Dutch
   disease is at work in, or poses a threat to, the Kazakh economy.
   Assessing the mechanism by which fluctuations in the price of oil can
   damage non-oil manufacturing-and thus long-term growth prospects in an
   economy that relies heavily on oil production-we find that non-oil
   manufacturing has so far been spared the perverse effects of oil price
   increases from 1996 to 2005. The real exchange rate in the open sector
   has appreciated over the last couple of years, largely due to the
   appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We analyze to what extent
   this appreciation is linked to movements in oil prices and oil revenues.
   Econometric evidence from the monetary model of the exchange rate and a
   variety of real exchange rate models show that the rise in the price of
   oil and in oil revenues might be linked to an appreciation of the U.S.
   dollar exchange rate of the oil and non-oil sectors. But appreciation is
   mainly limited to the real effective exchange rate for oil sector and is
   statistically insignificant for non-oil manufacturing.},

   it looks at how Southeast Asia is seen as part of this strategy,
   particularly as alternative economic partners for Kazakhstan. It argues
   that there are greater opportunities for enhanced economic interaction
   due to Kazakhstan's central role in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
   membership of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) that is shifting toward
   Asia, and reinvigorated economic diplomacy. Thirdly, it examines
   Kazakhstan's relations with five key Southeast Asian states - Singapore,
   Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand - which are Kazakhstan's
   largest trading partners in the region and arguably viewed as the
   Southeast Asian countries with the most potential to play a role in
   Kazakhstan's omnidirectional hedging strategy.},

Title = {Online Temptations: Divorce and Extramarital Affairs in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, the institution of marriage in Muslim Central Asia has
   undergone profound transformations in terms of religious dynamics,
   migration patterns, and the impact of globalization. In Kazakhstan
   between 2014 and 2019, every third marriage ended in divorce. By
   examining how Muslim Kazakhs' support for divorce and casual sex is
   related to their consumption of information obtained on the Internet,
   mobile phone, and social media, this study contributes to the growing
   body of literature on the transformative forces of information and
   communication technology (ICT) in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. It uses a
   mixed-method approach that contrasts wider statistical trends from the
   World Values Survey Wave 7 country dataset on Kazakhstan with empirical
   data from focus groups conducted in five different regions of the
   country in 2019, involving a total of 96 respondents. The findings from
   the statistical and non-statistical analysis show that frequent exposure
   to information online influences Muslim Kazakhs' support for
   extramarital affairs and divorce. Yet, frequent use of ICTs does not
   necessarily weaken the institution of marriage. Apart from its effect on
   university-educated female Kazakh youth, it seems to reinforce
   traditional understanding of marriage obligations among older
   generations and young men.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {347-367},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of outer space technopolitics in
   postSoviet Kazakhstan. It explores how outer space, the technological
   artefact of global relevance, works as a postcolonial fetish of
   modernity that is called upon to produce what it represents, that is,
   the reality of a technologically advanced Kazakh nation. The article
   shows that in its project of becoming a spacefaring nation the country
   reiterates major incentives that have motivated nuclear and space
   programme development in the postcolonial context of the Global South.
   It explores how collaboration with Russia allows Kazakhstan to claim its
   share in the Soviet space legacy rather than to distance itself from it.
   The study then traces the rise of a new internationalism in the
   Kazakhstani space programme outside the post-Soviet context. The article
   contributes to the debate on postcolonial technopolitics and shows how
   outer space has been used to enhance the conventional domain of
   postcolonial national ideologies nativism and tradition - with
   technology and science. Finally, it depicts how the growing resistance
   to the space programme among Kazakh civil society groups reveals a close
   association of the environmental agenda with an `eco-nationalism'
   permeated by a profoundly anti-imperial and, ultimately,
   anti-authoritarian political discourse.},

Title = {`Backward' industrialisation in resource-rich countries: The car
   industry in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {COMPETITION \& CHANGE},
Abstract = {This article analyses the `backward' form of import-substitution
   industrialisation (ISI) in countries integrated into the global economy
   as exporters of primary commodities, using the example of the car
   industry in Uzbekistan. This form of incorporation defines the way in
   which all manufacturing capitals, regardless of `nationality',
   accumulate at the average rate of profit via raw material rents, as
   mediated by specific state policies. This has been the case of
   Uzbekistan's state-owned car manufacturer UzAvtoSanoat, in joint-venture
   with Korean Daewoo Motor Company and American General Motors in the
   1992-2016 period. Orthodox (neoliberal) economists view the Uzbek car
   industry as inefficient due to state intervention. Heterodox
   ('developmental state') scholars hail it as an example of
   export-oriented industrial upgrading. Neither explain, however, why
   leading MNCs would invest in such an inefficient market (as per the
   former), given its low scale of production that is mostly purchased
   domestically (pace the latter). Instead, I contend that all
   manufacturing capitals in the country could stay profitable only via
   rent subsidisation, the main reason for leading MNCs to invest in it. As
   such, `backward' manufacturing ISI in Uzbekistan epitomises a specific
   national form taken by the global process of capital accumulation in
   resource-rich countries of the Global South.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-222},
Abstract = {The intensively propagated moral construct of ma'naviyat penetrates all
   fields of public life in present-day Uzbekistan. The originally
   religious term is used as the moral foundation of the state's official
   `ideology of national independence'. Portrayed as a return of the Uzbek
   people to their pre-Soviet past and their innate values and traditions,
   the ideological concept is preached as the only effective remedy for
   overcoming the negative Soviet legacies. Yet the analysis of the
   phenomenon shows that both the conceptualization of ma'naviyat at large
   and the concept's underlying rhetoric, ideas and structures reveal many
   analogies to Soviet times. By offering a detailed linguistic analysis of
   a range of official writings, I argue that the discourse about
   ma'naviyat works - similarly to Soviet ideological patterns - as a
   strong legitimizing factor of today's authoritarian regime.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates effects of interpersonal links with bureaucrats
   on SME access to formal finance. A survey of 502 SMEs in post-communist
   Uzbekistan shows fewer SMEs with government connections express a need
   for external finance, but success rates of applications are higher than
   for SMEs without connections. Econometric models show
   government-connected SMEs receive more formal credit than their
   counterparts. The small share of SME credit available is thus
   distributed in favour of those capitalising on bureaucratic links, with
   consequent resource misallocation. Findings imply that greater SME
   credit flows need supplementing with capacity building that improves
   bank transparency and efficiency.},

Title = {Boundary management and the discursive sphere - Negotiating `realities'
   in Khorezm, Uzbekistan},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {268-276},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With independence in 1991, Uzbekistan, as most of Central Asia, entered
   into a phase of socio-economic transformation. In agriculture, this
   state-driven restructuring of the former system has concentrated on the
   `formal' sphere of land and water governance.
   This paper assesses water management in Khorezm, Uzbekistan, taking a
   social constructivist and boundary work-inspired perspective. Several
   limitations to effective water management in Khorezm exist. We argue
   that three types of practices are widely employed to manage these and
   assure water access: formal, strategic, and discursive practices. The
   discrepancy between the formal water management institutions, manifested
   and regulated through formal practices and the informal, widely pursued
   through strategic practices and acts of deviation, is overcome through
   discursive practices. Verbal references to formal institutions therefore
   hamper the formalizing of informal practices. The institutionalized
   employment of all three types of practices fosters the production and
   reproduction of boundaries demarcating two, largely separate, spheres of
   reality in Khorezm's water management. Consequently, a high degree of
   resistance to the integration of informal water management realities
   into the formal regulatory environment prevails, preventing mutual
   learning and thus the locally informed restructuring towards more
   efficient and sustainable water management in Khorezm. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Terms used in the study of people/place bonding too often circumscribe
   thinking to either the most readily conceived and tangibly experienced
   scale of place - home/neighborhood - or to the most politically
   prevalent scale of place - the state. In doing so, researchers ignore
   the influence of places that help constitute identity between and above
   the aforementioned scales. A more elastic conceptualization of place
   attachment allows for mutability of place-identities and their capacity
   to be both multi-sited and varying in scale. With a long history of
   ethnic Russian habitation from the Tsarist through Soviet eras, the
   northern oblasts of Kazakhstan emerged as a borderland of potential
   irredentism akin to eastern Ukraine. Calls for secession and annexation
   have, however, been minimal thus rendering the region's amalgam of place
   identities a ready case for considering relational geographies of
   borderland place-attachment.},

Title = {Language Use among Secondary School Students in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-14},
Abstract = {This study analyzes the results of a survey conducted among 76 urban
   high school students of both genders at a school in Astana, Kazakhstan,
   to compare patterns of language use among children from classes with
   Russian and Kazakh language of instruction. The study revealed that
   Russian continues to dominate most of the spheres of language use and is
   utilized as the main language of communication by over 50\% of students
   enrolled in Russian classes, as well as the alternate language of
   communication with peers by around 70\% of the Kazakh-speaking youth
   attending Kazakh classes. The study also revealed that immediate family,
   including parents and grandparents in particular, play an important role
   in preserving the use of Kazakh as the main language of communication.
   Seventy seven percent of students in Kazakh classes use exclusively
   Kazakh in communication with grandparents. Meanwhile, in bilingual and
   Russian-speaking families parents no longer push the use of Kazakh by
   children with only 19\% of children using exclusively Kazakh with
   grandparents. Importantly, the study revealed that children in both
   groups increasingly rely on the use of Russian and English in
   communication across various modern media, such as TV and the Internet.
   The study concludes that the continuing dominance of Russian may create
   challenges for maintenance of Kazakh during introduction of trilingual
   education policy and recommends that greater attention should be paid by
   policy makers to development of Internet content in Kazakh, while ethnic
   Kazakh parents should maintain a stricter mono-lingula policy at home to
   preserve Kazakh.},

Title = {The relationship between contraceptive use and maternal and infant
   health outcomes in Tajikistan},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Number = {3},
Pages = {216-221},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: There has been no evaluation of the association between
   contraceptive use and maternal and child health (MCH) in Tajikistan,
   though the government has made concerted efforts to improve
   accessibility to family planning methods. The aim of this study is to
   understand the relationship between current contraceptive utilization
   and specific MCH outcomes in Tajikistan.
   Study Design: Using data from the 2012 Tajikistan Demographic and Health
   Survey, a total weighted sample of 6716 women aged 15 to 49 years who
   had at least one child at the time of interview was analyzed. Logistic
   regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between
   current contraceptive utilization and birth spacing, birth limiting and
   infant mortality.
   Results: Modern contraceptive use was low among women studied (27.1\%).
   Modern contraceptive users were more likely to present with a longer
   birth interval {[}adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.4, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = 2.0-2.8] than traditional or nonusers. Women who used
   modern contraceptives were half as likely to limit births to three or
   fewer children compared to traditional or nonusers (aOR = 0.5, 95\% CI =
   0.4-0.6). Among women whose most recent live birth resulted in death,
   modern contraceptive use was not associated with lower levels of infant
   mortality.
   Conclusion: Efforts made by the Tajik government to increase utilization
   of family planning have had mixed effects on overall uptake and the MCH
   outcomes analyzed in this study. These findings can help to inform the
   government's policy on family planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Since the demise of the Soviet Union, major changes have occurred in the
   local economy of the Wakhan area of Tajikistan. The inhabitants of this
   area now face several problems in economic enterprises, employment, and
   lifestyle. Most of the people are unable to survive on the incomes they
   derive from agriculture, and many young people have migrated to cities
   in Tajikistan or Russia in search of work. A promising industry for this
   area is tourism because of its beautiful landscapes and unique culture.
   Although tourism may be the most effective way to address the region's
   financial crisis, there are several problems in the promotion of the
   tourism industry. Improvements to infrastructure are necessary before
   suitable lodging can be built for tourism purposes. Moreover, the
   sustainable development of tourism should include the preservation of
   the traditional agriculture of the Wakhi mountain farmers. The formation
   of independent tourism organizations is important to the accomplishment
   of these goals.},

Title = {Higher education expansion in Kazakhstan and regime stability},
Journal = {POWER AND EDUCATION},
Abstract = {This research will analyze the ideological policy of the political
   regime of Kazakhstan in the field of higher education, which was
   supposed to find answers to the research question: why the Kazakhstan
   government is promoting the expansion of higher education. Thus, through
   the analysis of educational documents in the higher education system, an
   attempt will be made to identify the motives of the political regime in
   promoting the expansion of higher education in Kazakhstan. The study
   claims that the government of Kazakhstan promotes the expansion of
   higher education to maintain the regime stability. The Kazakhstan
   government's motives for promoting the expansion of higher education are
   based on taking control of a large number of school graduates by
   admitting them to Higher education institutions. In this way, these
   students will be socialized into the state's dominant ideology. Thus,
   the study will use the Gramscian approach, which will allow us to
   understand the political purpose of the Kazakh government in expanding
   higher education. An analysis of official state documents and curricula
   of higher educational institutions shows that the entire content of
   youth upbringing programs and compulsory academic disciplines aims to
   form moral and loyal citizens.},

Journal = {TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {1219-1243},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {To date, there has been limited research concerning the methodology and
   approach to Gulag heritage and how it has been memorialised and
   commodified for tourism purposes. The recent cultural commodification of
   the Soviet past and the development of participatory visitor experiences
   at Gulag museums in Kazakhstan necessitate to advance understandings of
   the roles authenticity and performance play in the management of Gulag
   museum practices in the country. Using a qualitative case study research
   approach based on a combination of semi-structured interviews with
   stakeholders involved in the development of Gulag tourism including
   senior management of museums, museum guides, policy-makers, tourism
   operators, local NGOs and experts in Soviet Gulag heritage, direct
   observations and qualitative document analysis of two Gulag museums and
   sites in Kazakhstan, the commodification and management of Soviet Gulag
   heritage is explored. Results reveal that beyond objects on display and
   images regarded as interpretive illustrations that allow visitors to
   connect with the past and verify history, dioramas and staged
   performances re-enacting various elements of the Gulag life are used as
   immersive and emotional tools to accentuate the ?dark? atmosphere of the
   epoch and induce a more impactful and participatory visitor experience.
   The findings contribute to literature on authenticity and performance in
   Gulag tourism by examining the delicate question of the extent to which
   stakeholders involved in the management of the Gulag tragedy can offer
   meaningful visitor experiences that are historically accurate and
   protect the dignity of the victims while adapting to the dynamic roles
   of museums as heritage and education sites.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variation and driving factors of wetland in the Amu
   Darya River Delta, Central Asia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Aral Sea in Central Asia has shrunk by 90\% since 1960. The
   resulting desertification and salt and dust storms have diminished
   biodiversity in the Amu Darya River Delta, triggering the Aral Sea
   Crisis. Timely monitoring of trends and spatial patterns in deltaic
   wetlands is beneficial for biodiversity conservation and ecological
   restoration. Existing studies have mainly focused on the response of
   vegetation and microbial communities to ecological changes while
   ignoring the indicative role of wetlands-associated changes. This study
   analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of long time series wetland
   changes extracted from remote sensing imagery through cover frequency
   maps and landscape indices. The hydrological data, land use/land cover
   change maps, and statistical data were combined to explore the driving
   factors of wetland change over the past 40 years. The results showed
   that the wetland area increased by 2242.96 km(2) (90.72\%) from 1977 to
   2019. The wetland area increased at 268.01 km(2)/ a from the 1970s to
   the early 1990s, with a fluctuating change since 1994. Wetlands are
   mainly distributed in the transition zone between the delta and the Aral
   Sea, accounting for approximately 81.61\% of the total wetland area. The
   proportion of wetlands on the east and west sides significantly expanded
   along the canal system, increasing from 0.13\% in 1977 to 9.74\% in
   2019. The degree of fragmentation of the wetland landscape in the entire
   delta increased by 1.7 times. With decreasing runoff into the delta, the
   expansion of cultivated land and the construction of reservoirs and
   irrigation canals changed the spatio-temporal distribution of water
   resources. In contrast, agricultural irrigation has raised the
   groundwater level. Human activities, such as the expansion of cultivated
   land and the construction of reservoirs and irrigation canals, are the
   main reasons for the spatio-temporal changes in wetland distribution,
   and exacerbated the decrease in water flow into the Aral Sea and its
   shrinkage. The restoration of wetlands is not a proof of ecological
   improvement, it resulted from the redistribution of water resources in
   the delta. The increase in wetland area represents an apparent
   ecological contrast with the drying up of the Aral Sea, and the
   phenomenon is not conducive to the ecological restoration of the delta.},

Abstract = {Working in a context suffused with distrust towards local populations,
   inherited from precolonial times, the first European or Russian
   scholars, explorers, and artists who were interested in the ancient
   history of Central Asia did not carry out any archaeological study
   without the assistance of ``natives{''}. These were, however, criticized
   for their ``ignorance{''}, their ``lack of taste for beautiful
   things{''}, their ``delusion{''} in relation with the historical data,
   or their ``vandalism{''} towards vestiges. Despite this, they were the
   ones who lead the modern scholars to the sites or monuments, did the
   actual work on the excavations, and provided the collectors and the
   organizers of exhibitions with archaeological finds, while generally
   remaining unnamed. With time, the propagation in Turkestan of a ``taste
   for History{''} developed the market of antiquities and produced
   indigenous ``amateurs{''} in archaeology who appropriated an
   appreciation system of the vestiges that had been crafted in Europe.
   This turn is doubly interesting: on the one hand, it shows the ambiguity
   of the process of incorporating local epistemic expertise in the
   knowledge of ``colonizers{''}; on the other hand, it underlines how
   local scholars appropriated Western approaches to patrimonialization
   while denigrating the attitude of their own Central-Asiatic milieu
   towards the past.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the state of Kazakhstan's environmental legislation
   after nearly 30 years of development as an independent state. The state
   of ecological systems is directly related to production and economic
   activities, as well as the state policy in the field of environmental
   protection. The main environmental problems of Kazakhstan are: the
   residence of a significant part of the population in the area of direct
   influence of harmful production factors, the most influential of which
   are emissions of pollutants into the air, uneven distribution of fresh
   water across regions, increase in the volume of production and
   consumption waste. The approximation of Kazakhstan's legislation to
   universal environmental protection standards is difficult, including in
   terms of the impact of sustainable development goals on the context of
   environmental legislation. The paper explores the areas in which
   environmental regulations need to be revised and implemented through
   adequate legal mechanisms. This document facilitates discussions on
   improving environmental legal norms in national legislation. (C)2022

Title = {Corruption, public procurement and political instability in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan, seen as an example of political stability in Central Asia,
   recently descended into political turmoil. While the causes of the
   violence and unrest are the subject of ongoing analysis, their origins
   can be linked to systemic inequalities in a country rich in natural
   resources. Inter alia, Kazakhstan has failed to tackle insidious
   problems of corruption, particularly in public procurement contracts.
   Public procurement constitutes a significant amount of government
   spending in developing countries which makes it a high-risk area for
   corruption. Using primary data collected from small and medium-size
   enterprises organisations in Kazakhstan, this research finds that public
   officials and suppliers are complicit in corrupt practices. Intervention
   strategies, such as monitoring and control, have failed to tackle this
   problem. While the causes of recent political instability in Kazakhstan
   are multiple, corruption remains an underlying and persistent problem
   which will add to the fermenting discontent among the citizens of
   Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {In this paper, critically analysis of the agricultural trade
   competitiveness and complementarity of 28 agriculture products between
   Kazakhstan and China was investigated. The agriculture trade flow period
   was considered from 2008 to 2018. The agricultural trade competitiveness
   and complementarity analysis were carried out by using four different
   trade models. Models were normalized revealed comparative advantage
   (NRCA), trade complementarity index (TCI), trade combining density
   (TCD), and trade specialization index (TSC). The results showed that (1)
   Kazakhstan and China have differences in comparative advantages in the
   international market, and at the same time, they are not considered
   ``natural trading partners{''}. In recent years (3), dependence on
   mutual trade between countries in agricultural products has been
   steadily growing. In addition, it should be noted that the structure of
   foreign trade is dominated by inter-industry trade based on comparative
   advantages, which means different trade orientations of countries and a
   huge potential for further cooperation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Kazakhstan's innovation policy has enjoyed a noticeable
   rally: ways to support innovation are being actively discussed, a
   suitable ``toolbox{''} is developing, the susceptibility of
   decision-makers to the mechanisms for encouraging innovation is
   increasing. Nevertheless, effective levers of influence on business, in
   which innovation activity could manifest locally, have not been found
   yet. Although this does not change the overall economic situation.
   Following on from the results of a survey of various level business
   managers and factor analysis performed prior, the authors study the
   influence of incentive mechanisms on entity activities and their
   ``inquiry{''} on the public policy content. The authors come to the
   conclusion that most of the tools to stimulate innovation
   entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan are currently aimed at successful market
   players, creating conditions for technological modernization of existing
   industries, and at improving the level of entrepreneurs' business and
   technological competencies. According to a study conducted in
   Kazakhstan, it is necessary to increase the participation of
   universities, research institutes, local executive and legislative
   authorities in the development of management mechanisms and the
   promotion of innovation entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {This study examines the post-socialist transition in the secondary
   education history programme in Kazakhstan from 1990 to the present. The
   article examines the influence of policy talk and action upon official
   educational policy, and how the deployment of a new national narrative
   is being used to construct a de-Sovietized-re-Kazakhified national
   identity. Educational objectives in calling for de-Russification and
   de-Sovietization are considered in the light of two other objectives: to
   de-politicize and de-ideologize the curriculum following the break-up of
   the Soviet Union. I argue that there are two parallel projects at work
   that both support a more Kazakhified history curriculum and
   counter-balance an ethno-nationalizing programme by developing the World
   History programme. This study is based on 10 months of in-country
   fieldwork encompassing document review, interviews and classroom
   observations in Kazakh and Russian medium of instruction schools.},

Abstract = {Many studies have compared the Russian and Chinese projects currently
   underway in the Central Asian region, namely the Eurasian Economic Union
   (EAEU) and the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), both of which seek to
   increase integration with Central Asian states. Yet little attention has
   been paid to how these endeavors are perceived locally by Central Asians
   themselves. This article aims to fill this gap by presenting the
   findings of a comparative discourse analysis of perceptions of Russia
   and China in online Russian-language media in Kyrgyzstan. The research
   reveals that while Russia's role in the region has been seen primarily
   in political terms and China's role chiefly in economic terms, these
   perceptions are changing, and that a growing percentage of articles are
   devoted to economics in the case of Russia and politics in the case of
   China. Another finding from this research is that China receives a
   greater percentage of positive coverage than Russia. It is suggested
   that as two important poles in the emerging multi-polar world, China and
   Russia should ensure their respective projects complement, rather than
   conflict, with one another in the region.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic and survey data, Madeleine Reeves explores the
   meanings and impact of large-scale seasonal labor migration to Russia on
   a group of four kin-related villages in southern Kyrgyzstan. Although
   remittances have come to figure centrally in domestic budgets of migrant
   families, it is to questions of political economy that we must turn to
   understand the shift away from small-scale farming toward migrant work.
   Reeves examines a range of factors mediating decisions to migrate,
   including the role of social networks and sibling hierarchies; the
   emergence of growing economic differentials between migrant and
   nonmigrant households, and the growing importance for young men of a
   period of work ``in town{''} (shaarda) in proving their eligibility for
   marriage. Although patterns of economic activity in southern Kyrgyzstan
   have changed dramatically in recent years, Reeves argues that new forms
   of engagement in distant labor markets are also being used to sustain
   patterns of ritual gifting and expressions of ethnic and religious
   identity that are imagined and articulated precisely as expressions of
   social continuity.},

Abstract = {This article examines recent renewable energy initiatives in two
   hydrocarbon rich states of Eurasia: Kazakhstan and Russia. The global
   nature of challenges surrounding energy and natural resource use demand
   that sustainability and ``energy transition{''} policies be understood
   as geopolitical issues, which are increasingly (re)defining political
   relations among and within states. Existing research and media coverage
   of international energy politics in Eurasia is overwhelmingly dominated
   by a focus on oil and gas extraction, especially in Kazakhstan and
   Russia, due to their central place in traditional hydrocarbon fuels
   markets. As elsewhere in the world, however, political and economic
   leaders in both countries have started to adopt the language of
   promoting environmental sustainability, the ``green economy,{''} and
   renewable energy infrastructures. Taking a critical geopolitics lens to
   recent developments, this article considers who is involved in advancing
   renewable energy in contexts that have traditionally been dependent on
   traditional energy sources, and what this may portend for the shifting
   energy landscape of Eurasia.},

Abstract = {This article explores contemporary artistic practices in Kazakhstan that
   challenge narratives on national belonging and identity through the
   notion of queerness. It discusses artworks created by artists Saule
   Dyussenbina, Natalya Dyu and Kuanish Bazargaliyev, the artistic duo
   Kreolex Center, and the advertising agency Havas Worldwide Kazakhstan,
   which were created as a reaction to global discussions around gender and
   sexuality happening in and between various countries. It seeks to
   scrutinize different approaches and aspects presented in each artwork
   and argues that the overall strategy present in all the artistic
   testimonies is humour. While drawing on key concepts and categorizations
   of humour that permit the uncovering of the ways in which humour creates
   specific knowledge and identity, this article looks at humour techniques
   more broadly and builds on the argumentation provided by Uros Cvoro and
   Chrisoula Lionis that opt for humour analysis connected to temporality
   and its perception in the works of art.},

Abstract = {This article tracks housing protests in Kazakhstan's former capital
   city, Almaty, from 1989 to 2016 for what they reveal about shifting
   ideas of rights and obligations between citizens and state. Three broad
   models of moral economies of housing emerge: the first, during the
   Soviet period, where equal access to housing was nominally in return for
   labour; the second, during the early Republican period when pro-Kazakh
   policies favoured previously marginalised ethnic Kazakhs, and, the
   third, in the period 2004 - 2008, when the country's wealth increased,
   before the financial crash and the plunging value of the local currency.
   This last period was when a professional class was increasingly
   valorised by the government with housing support mechanisms created
   specifically for them. Protests in each period highlight the failures of
   each model to provide secure, adequate housing. A constant theme of
   illegal legality' and informal practices, variously construed by
   citizens as moral, pragmatic or immoral, have consistently undermined
   both the achievement of housing promises and the safety and security of
   housing. The article explores the paradox of why citizens continue to
   demand help and interventions from the state amidst such pervasive
   untrustworthiness.},

Abstract = {This paper present the research aimed at studying learned helplessness
   and values in young migrants from the Central Asia who are educated in
   Russia at different stages of sociocultural adaptation. The
   psychological diagnostic study using the Sh. Schwartz questionnaire of
   values, as well as the learned helplessness questionnaire, has shown
   that learned helplessness accompanies the process of sociocultural
   adaptation of the migrants and features nonlinear trends. The young
   migrants' values also change in the course of sociocultural adaptation
   and are associated with learned helplessness. Regardless of their
   adaptation stages, the migrant students coming from the Central Asia
   value maintaining and improving the wellbeing of the people they are in
   close relationships with. The migrants are aimed at kindly relations,
   which enables them to satisfy their needs of positive interaction and
   affiliation, as well as to level out the condition of learned
   helplessness.},

Abstract = {Tajikistan like other mountainous nations in Central Asia faces the dual
   problem of poverty and exposure to multiple natural hazards such as mass
   wasting, flooding, and prolonged cold. In this case study,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 rural Tajik households
   in order to characterize their vulnerability and adaptation to prolonged
   winter cold. The household interviews were supplemented with interviews
   with village leaders, doctors, and school staff. Key interview themes
   regarding the road network were then compared with GIS road network
   analysis of the region. Results suggested that the area is highly
   vulnerable to the impacts of prolonged cold, which could ultimately be
   made worse through the unsustainable land-use practices, especially for
   agricultural and biofuel resources. The combination of unreliable
   sources of income and lower accessibility to markets in winter results
   in less ability of the residents of these rural villages to mitigate the
   impacts of prolonged cold. Analysis of the road network using GIS
   provided additional evidence for the influence of accessibility on
   vulnerability to prolonged cold.},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of China's energy cooperation with
   Central Asia in the context of competition between geopolitical actors.
   Using historical narrative analysis methods to unfold the dynamics of
   the interactions between the actors, the author presents a case study of
   Kazakhstan's energy industry. This study could offer broader
   implications as the country attracted the lion's share of foreign direct
   investment in Central Asia, including investment from China within the
   Belt and Road Initiative. The analysis suggests that Central Asian
   states benefited from the competition between global actors as they
   diversified their export routes, which strengthened their political and
   economic independence. In the end, Central Asian states and energy
   consumers developed energy cooperation networks in the same area where
   the ancient Silk Road crossed the Eurasian landmass. Concerning the
   theoretical implications, this article highlights to the usefulness of
   applying both realist and liberal frameworks of international relations
   theory in tandem.},

Abstract = {Development of the modern legal integration expresses in convergence of
   legal families, both through development of international law, and
   through processes of regional integrations and interactions. However, it
   is necessary to mark that an entity of legal processes of the modern
   legal integration express, eventually, in convergence and integration at
   the level of specific legal systems of the states. Process of
   evolutionary development of law at the real stage, in the entity, is
   process of convergence of legal systems. The most important legal
   processes of legal integration are, first of all, harmonization of law,
   which defines the main direction of deformation of legal systems and
   also unification (assimilation) of law, legal expansion (or absorption),
   reception of law, etc. In this article the processes of a dimple
   integration of the legal systems of the countries of Central Asia in the
   Eurasian economic space are researched. The model of equivalent
   cooperation of the people, which reached the high level of consciousness
   and the civilization, and movable by aspiration to approve social and
   international peace and harmony of the people, is considered. The scale
   crisis response measures of the state aimed at restoration of sure rates
   of economic growth and support of strong social warranties to all

Abstract = {Integrated water resource management (IWRM) is a widely recognized
   management framework that is currently being adopted throughout
   post-Soviet Central Asia to inform and guide national water sector
   reforms, and to keep up with the pace of the faster moving land reforms
   taking place in the region. With hydrographic principles and public
   participation being at the core of this framework, the process in the
   region has started with the reform of on-farm irrigation systems by
   creating water users associations (WUAs), transferring irrigation
   management to them and introducing irrigation service fees. This paper
   draws on the experiences, over four years, of three study WUAs set up in
   the Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.
   Aiming to explore the differences in institutional environment and
   arrangements in these three countries for establishing WUAs, as well as
   assessing WUA performances (particularly from users' perspectives), the
   study reveals that it is not only the newly-established institutional
   arrangements in the irrigation sector but also their internal
   operations, coupled with other important factors such as size of area
   farmed, overall viability of agriculture and a wider economic context
   that crucially determine overall irrigation performance.},

Abstract = {The present article analyses the provisions of the 2006 Semipalatinsk
   Treaty establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in Central Asia, explores
   their different nature and compares them with those contained in the
   Treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga, Bangkok and Pelindaba. The
   fundamental question to be answered is whether the Semipalatinsk Treaty
   will effectively contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
   The article concludes that the treaty contains lights and shadows:
   although some positive innovations have been included in the final text,
   there are loopholes that might weaken the denuclearization regime. The
   ``Great Game{''} in Central Asia and the tight relations of the regional
   States with the Russian Federation might also hamper the efforts to
   obtain the support of the other nuclear powers.},

Abstract = {Soil salinization is a serious problem in the arid and semi-arid regions
   of Central Asia. To address the problems, we analyzed the dynamics and
   distribution patterns of salts in both rice-based and cotton-based
   cropping fields in selected farms of southern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
   with special emphasis on the dynamics of gypsum, which had a lower
   solubility than Na salts, as an index of water-movement regimes in
   irrigated fields. Most of the rice-based plots and some of the
   cotton-based plots exhibited no surface accumulation of soluble salts or
   gypsum because of repeated washing by a huge amount of irrigation water
   in the former or comfortable drainage in the latter. These soils are
   probably free from the risk of secondary salinization under present
   conditions and management practices. In contrast, uncultivated plots
   near canals accumulate both soluble salts and gypsum in the surface soil
   layers, and these salts would not be leached out without a drastic
   change to a predominantly downward pattern of water movement. In the
   intermediate stages in terms of soil salinization, some soils
   accumulated substantial amounts of soluble salts in surface layers but
   relatively low amounts of gypsum. In this case, periodic irrigation
   could have washed out most of the gypsum and soluble salts in a downward
   direction and, consequently, it is possible to leach out the accumulated
   soluble salts by applying additional irrigation water if necessary.
   However, there were some cases in which soils accumulated large amounts
   of gypsum in surface layers as well as soluble salts, suggesting that
   irrigation/drainage is generally insufficient to remove gypsum with a
   lower solubility and that these profiles are dominated by an overall
   upward movement of water. For these soils, drainage facilities should be
   improved to ensure the efficient leaching of accumulated salts on
   cropping. Thus, the condition of irrigated plots in terms of the
   direction of water movement and resulting salt regimes can be well
   understood from the distribution patterns of both soluble salts (or
   cations) and gypsum.},

   investigation, their challenges and potential. The contributors discuss
   how particular kinds of sources such as climate models, archival
   manuscripts, ethnographic fieldwork and media analyses have been used to
   understand environmental changes in the region. In what ways do the
   traditions of scholars' disciplinary training guide the scale of
   analysis? Looking toward the future of environmental humanities in
   Central Asia, this roundtable suggests paths for developing this vital

   the country's two presidents have used Islam to buttress their regimes,
   and the state actively discourages other forms of religious expression.
   The law appears to make room for religious pluralism but, in reality,

   national culture perspective was more successful in achieving
   post-acquisition social integration than a culturally close one. We
   ascribe this to the fact that although both acquirers made extensive use
   of both formal and informal social integration mechanisms, they favored
   different types. We also specify other contextual variables which may

Abstract = {Changes in elite composition during the post-Soviet transition in Russia
   and Central and Eastern Europe have received significant scholarly
   attention, but corollary developments in other former `Communist'
   countries, including Kazakhstan, have attracted much less scrutiny, or
   have been attributed to organic features of Central Asian society. We
   examine the trajectory of the Kazakhstan elite in the light of three key
   perspectives on elite transformation: the first claims that the country
   has reverted to traditional clan social structures, the second proposes
   the conquest of power by a nascent `acquisition class', and the third
   argues that the Soviet-era elite was largely successful in maintaining
   power during the economic reorganisation. We find that Kazakhstan's
   experience most closely matches the third explanation.},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The Soviet Union was established in about 1920, but due to large-scale
   processes such as collectivization, World War II, and their negative
   consequences, the transitional period that followed the establishment
   was extended to the late 1950s. Rapid Soviet modernization through the
   liquidation of local traditions was in many places just a show. This
   essay focusing on local practices argues that the Soviet economy in
   rural Kyrgyz Republic was created through the interaction between the
   state and local kinship relations. Moreover, where the Soviet class
   system was weak in rural areas in particular, kinship relations worked
   instead. Based mainly on freshly obtained empiric materials from a
   village in Kyrgyzstan, this article displays the mechanism of how the
   kinship and the state created an economy in the context of the Soviet
   rural areas.},

Abstract = {Situated at the crossroads of the Silk Road, Central Asia has been an
   arena of international competition for centuries. Today, a ``New Great
   Game{''} appears to be taking place between Russia, China and, to a
   lesser extent, the United States and the European Union for regional
   hegemony. In the last two decades, Russia and China formed an ``axis of
   convenience{''}, both to counter Western influence and to thwart
   regional challenges; however, this has increasingly turned to rivalry in
   recent years, with China gradually replacing Russia as the chief power
   with regard to geo-economic and energy assets in some Central Asian
   countries. An analysis based on Power Transition Theory points to two
   possible future scenarios for the rivalry, namely China's predominance
   or a Chinese-Russian modus vivendi based on a `division of labour'.},

Title = {Integrated Water Resources Management in Central Asia, as a way of
   survival in conditions of water scarcity},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {311},
Pages = {181-188},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {This paper presents the practical outputs of Integrated Water Resources
   Management (IWRM) pilot implementation in the Fergana Valley shared by
   three countries of Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
   IWRM was not a new approach for Central Asian countries. Some its
   elements have been practiced for irrigated agriculture development in
   the region during the Soviet time. For instance, hydrographic
   institutional set up, coordination between different water users across
   multiple levels of water hierarchy, water conservation, and consolidated
   records for all types of waters uses were applied for the development of
   virgin lands in the Golodnaya Steppe in the 1960-1970s. The new economic
   and financial conditions of the 1990s and restructuring of the agrarian
   sector required an updated vision of IWRM to support reforms. To respond
   to these needs, in 2001 Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) suggested
   development of a vision of IWRM that would reflect the specificities of
   the region, and testing it in a pilot project in the Fergana Valley. The
   IWRM-Fergana project was implemented by national teams from Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan and coordinated by the Association of
   Scientific Information Center of Interstate Commission for Water
   Coordination (SIC ICWC) and International Water Management Institute
   (IWMI). The main purpose of the project was to contribute to more secure
   livelihoods, increased environmental sustainability, and greater social
   harmony through improved effectiveness of water resources management
   using IWRM principles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

   of the Amu Darya River Basin, Central Asia},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With population growth, climate volatility, and economic expansion, the
   conjunctive management of surface-groundwater (SGW) faces great
   challenges. In this study, a hybrid factorial optimization programming
   (HFOP) method is developed through integrating factorial analysis,
   interval linear programming, flexible fuzzy programming, and two-stage
   stochastic programming into a general framework. HFOP can effectively
   reflect the multiple uncertainties and quantitatively identify the
   effects of multiple factors. Then, a HFOP-SGW model is formulated for
   the middle reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin, where 125 scenarios are
   analyzed. Some of the major findings are: (i) the improvement of
   surface-water transport efficiency and the proper use of groundwater can
   effectively alleviate regional water shortage; (ii) agricultural users
   have a high risk of water scarcity for all states, especially under a
   low-flow level; (iii) uncertainties of water-flow levels and
   risk-reverse attitudes of decision makers have significant impacts on
   the system's benefits and water-allocation scheme; and (iv) the
   surface-water-transmission loss rate and risk perceptions of decision
   makers are the main factors affecting the system's benefit's and
   water-allocation scheme. These findings can help decision makers obtain
   desired water-allocation strategies to respond to the variations in
   water availability.},

Abstract = {In central Asian countries, sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus)
   represent a key economic resource for millions of people living in rural
   communities and, at the same time, a critical source of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. This study aims to estimate GHG emissions of several
   economic traits of sheep and goats and investigate sustainable
   mitigation strategies. It advances beyond previous studies by
   calculating the GHG emissions of traits of economic importance rather
   than reporting average animal emission and can thus provide insights for
   creating better-targeted mitigation strategies. In dairy sheep in
   Tajikistan, the emission intensity (EI) decreased from 62.4 to
   56.7kgCO(2)-eqkg(-1) of protein as the production of milk increased by
   20\%. In meat goats raised in Turkmenistan, the EI decreased by
   2.6kgCO(2)-eqkg(-1) of protein when simulating an increase in meat
   production of +20\%. Improving female fertility by 10\% scaled down the
   EI of meat sheep in Uzbekistan by 36kgCO(2)-eqkg(-1) of protein. The
   improvement of meat and milk productions, female fertility, and litter
   size and the reduction of mortality, and female culling can reduce the
   emission intensity of sheep and goats globally. Thus, genetic
   improvement of economic traits is an important global mitigation tool.
   Furthermore, improvement of national and international sheep and goat
   strategies can provide policymakers with valuable information to develop
   regional and global mitigation actions.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of artificial recharge of winter surface flows coupled with
   increased summer groundwater use for irrigation in the Sokh aquifer
   (Central Asia) have been investigated. Water release patterns from the
   giant Toktogul reservoir have changed, as priority is now given to
   hydropower generation in winter in Kyrgyzstan. Winter flows have
   increased and summer releases have declined, but the Syr Darya River
   cannot pass these larger winter flows and the excess is diverted to a
   natural depression, creating a 40 x 10(9)m(3) lake. A water balance
   study of all 18 aquifers feeding the Fergana Valley indicated the
   feasibility of winter groundwater recharge in storage created by summer
   abstraction. This modeling study examines the dynamics of the process in
   one aquifer over a 5-year period, with four scenarios: the current
   situation; increased groundwater abstraction of around 625 million (M)
   m(3)/year; groundwater abstraction with an artificial recharge of 144
   Mm(3)/year, equivalent to the volume available in low flow years in the
   Sokh River; and with a larger artificial recharge of 268 Mm(3)/year,
   corresponding to high flow availability. Summer surface irrigation
   diversions can be reduced by up to 350 Mm(3) and water table levels can
   be lowered.},

Abstract = {This article presents two hitherto unstudied compilations of verses from
   the Bust?n of Sa?d?. Both circulated in the Persianate world in the
   fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The article provides an analysis of
   the compilations? content as well as their relation to the complete
   Bust?n. By highlighting certain stories and themes at the expense of
   others, and by ordering these passages in a way that differs from the
   complete Bust?n, each compilation transforms Sa?d??s text into a
   shorter, more homogenous composition, with distinct formal, thematic,
   and generic qualities. The shorter compilation presents a series of
   aphorisms, forming a mirror for princes. The longer one offers a
   selection of stories and lessons and emphasizes mystical themes,
   including aspects of Sufi erotic theology. This article also
   investigates the manuscript copies of these compilations, revealing
   their use and transmission in Iran, Turkey, and Central Asia between
   1470 and 1550.},

Title = {Oil and gas cooperation between China and Central Asia in an environment

Journal = {PETROLEUM SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {596-605},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper investigates Central Asia's oil and gas resources, special
   geopolitics and energy competition, and approaches, challenges and
   prospects in cooperation between China and Central Asia. The objective
   is to propose measures for oil and gas cooperation between China and
   Central Asia. Central Asia is rich in oil and gas resources. Its
   remaining recoverable reserves of crude oil and natural gas account for
   1.9\% and 10.6\%, respectively, of the world's total reserves. Moreover,
   there is great exploration and development potential. As a strategic
   channel connecting Eurasia, Central Asia has a prominent geopolitical
   status. Many powerful countries such as the United States, Russia and
   China, as well as Europe, have an intense energy competition in Central
   Asia. In the oil and gas cooperation with Central Asia, the China
   National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) focuses on establishing a
   coordination group, promoting overall oil and gas business opportunities
   and sustainable development, innovating and applying specialty
   engineering technology and improving project economic benefits. Through
   its efforts over the last nearly two decades, the China National
   Petroleum Corporation has completed a 50-million-tonne a year oil and
   gas production centre in Central Asia and oil and gas pipelines passing
   through multiple countries, becoming an important channel for securing
   China's energy imports. If appropriate measures are taken in the
   `Thirteenth Five-Year Plan' period or later, the China National
   Petroleum Corporation will develop a 100-million-tonne p.a. oil and gas
   production centre in Central Asia and a strategic oil and gas import
   channel exceeding this amount of production. This cooperation between
   China and Central Asia is however faced with the following challenges:
   increasing multinational competition uncertainty, potential risks in the
   political systems of Central Asian countries, frequently occurring
   violence and also resource policy tightening in Central Asia. To further
   oil and gas cooperation with Central Asia, it is recommended that China
   should develop an energy acquisition strategy, assign a regional energy
   ambassador, enhance oil and gas supply by mergers and acquisitions,
   establish regional multinational subsidiaries and improve its risk
   prevention system.},

Abstract = {The quick rise of commercially viable renewable energy worldwide
   presents encouraging opportunities for sustainable growth, but it also
   portends new risks. Hydrocarbon-producing nations of Eurasia have
   typically strongly relied on geographic proximity to their most
   lucrative export market: Europe. Yet the revolutionary nature of
   Europe's `Green Deal' means that their position is under threat. While
   the demand-side ramifications of the global low-carbon transition are
   widely discussed, little consideration has been given to the inevitable
   implications for hydrocarbons producers, particularly in the
   less-studied central Asian region. This article draws attention to the
   interconnections between hydrocarbon rents, regime stability and new
   foreign policy strategies in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in
   the wake of the global shift away from oil to renewable energy. By so
   doing, it systematically examines what implications the energy
   transition has on crucial petrostates in central Asia, and what this, in

Title = {Assessing tourism destination competitiveness: the case of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLICY RESEARCH IN TOURISM LEISURE AND EVENTS},
Abstract = {Tourism competitiveness is important for destinations to attract
   tourists and outshine competing destinations by providing high-quality,
   innovative tourism services and attractions while ensuring available
   resources are used efficiently but sustainably. The purpose of this
   research is to develop tourism competitiveness indices, considering both
   internal and external factors, including quantitative and qualitative
   methods that are suitable for emerging tourist destinations. A range of
   tourism stakeholders was sampled including tourism business owners and
   managers in various sectors, public administrators, and academics. They
   were asked to nominate competitiveness indicators. These indicators were
   then ranked and prioritized to provide a weighted score of
   competitiveness for the destination as well as tourism services. We
   apply this method of assessing tourism destination competitiveness to
   Kazakhstan. An assessment of the destination competitiveness of
   Kazakhstan shows that the natural environment is an area of competitive
   advantage followed by tourism policy while Kazakhstan is least
   competitive in the ability to ensure quality tourism services, on
   indicators such as pricing, language knowledge of tourism employees, and
   professionalism of tourism employees. The method allows academics,
   industry, and policymakers to easily interpret the indicators and
   factors that contribute to the quality and competitiveness of tourism
   services at the macro and micro levels.},

Abstract = {We study how Russian colonization of the Kazakh steppes in the late 19th
   century influenced the evolution of traditional institutions of Kazakhs.
   Using a rich dataset constructed from Russian colonial expedition
   materials, we find that during the transition from nomadic pastoralism
   to a semi-sedentary pastoralist-agricultural system, Kazakhs'
   traditional communes shrank, property rights on land became more
   individualized, and households became less likely to pool labor for
   farming. We argue that two main forces behind this evolution were
   increasing land pressure and technological change. The speed and the
   magnitude of these adjustments were much larger than usually assumed in
   most of development economics literature on traditional institutions.},

   Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes and calculates the utilization and efficiency of
   land and water resources in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) from 2000 to 2014,
   using MODIS remote sensing data and the Water Use Efficiency Monitor in
   Central Asia (WUEMoCA) database. The results show that (1) Over the past
   15 years, the water area in ASB has decreased at a rate of 1048 km(2)
   per year, from a proportion of 2.5\% in 2000 to 1.5\% in 2014. The Aral
   Sea in particular has witnessed a significant reduction of 60.28\% of
   its area, dropping from 28,119 km(2) in 2000 to 11,169 km(2) in 2014.
   (2)The annual yield per unit area of wheat was the highest (4.16
   tons/ha), followed by rice (2.27 tons/ha) and cotton (2.22 tons/ha).
   Water productivity of wheat in the ASB was the highest (0.881 kg/m(3)),
   followed by rice (0.689 kg/m(3)) and wheat (0.451 kg/m(3)). (3)
   Generally, crop and water productivity in irrigated areas along the Syr
   Darya River is greater than that of the Amu Darya River, and that of the
   upper irrigation areas is larger than the lower ones. The Fergana Valley
   and Tashkent areas have the relatively highest land and water resources
   utilization efficiency.},

Abstract = {The close and reciprocal ties between poverty and environmental
   degradation present significant potential for simultaneous improvement
   of the livelihood of the poorest along with increased opportunities and
   enhanced resilience of the environment and natural resources. By
   supporting governments and other stakeholders in designing and
   implementing development plans that tackle environmental and poverty
   concerns in a joint manner, the globally operating UNDP-UNEP
   Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) addresses a major governance
   challenge for sustainable development (SD) and the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) in particular. Focusing on Central Asia, and
   specifically Tajikistan, a country outside the spotlight of studies
   concerned with SD governance mechanisms, and through the analysis of PEI
   programme documents and stakeholders' interviews, this article probes
   into the governance and governance co-ordination (metagovernance)
   settings for SD. The article closes by presenting a set of
   recommendations to improve governance co-ordination, while achieving
   more inclusive decision-making and ultimately increasing the impact of
   PEI on the society and the environment. Specifically, it argues for
   improved information policy and enhanced integration of endogenous
   knowledge. Furthermore, national and local development planning and
   private initiatives should be better linked, and the different levels of
   governance for poverty-environment mainstreaming should be more
   coherent. The solutions discussed are of relevance for wider Central
   Asia and the global community engaged in moving the SDGs into the
   mainstream of governance and policy frameworks.},

   national belonging. Controlling for the effects of interest in politics,
   community trust and public sector employment are also positively
   associated with voting in this election, whereas evidence on
   ethno-cultural inclusion is mixed. These findings highlight the role of
   social embeddedness in political participation in young post-communist

Abstract = {Based on a case study in central Kyrgyzstan, this paper examines the
   links between the environment, rural livelihoods, and labor migration.
   The low diversity of income-generating activities in rural areas
   increases vulnerability to climate change impacts, other environmental
   stresses, and market failures. As a result, additional livelihood
   strategies such as labor migration and engagement in trade or other
   business ventures have become essential coping strategies for rural
   households. Remittances sent by migrants contribute not only to
   individual rural households but also to rural community development.
   Remittances help repay loans that have been taken out by households for
   different purposes, particularly for running or expanding farming and
   animal husbandry. When remittances are spent to increase livestock
   herds, the resulting intensive use of nearby pastures often leads to
   overgrazing and land degradation.},

Abstract = {Central Asia has long emerged as a hotspot for both the regional and
   extra-regional powers for two main reasons: its geopolitical location in
   the middle of Eurasia between Europe, South Asia, the Middle East,
   Russia and China, and their abundant and mostly unexplored natural
   resources. Sitting on huge untapped hydrocarbon potentials the Central
   Asian geographical entity in recent years has offered enormous
   opportunity and appeal for global countries and emerged as a grand
   chessboard for regional and extra-regional players. China is one such
   new pole in the new great game without which any geopolitical and
   geo-economic debate on Central Asia would be incomplete. With this
   prelude, this article attempts to analyse China's rise in Central Asia
   and its strategies to strengthen its position in the heartland region by
   discarding the much-hyped great game thesis and argues that China's rise
   is unparallel and unmatched as testified by the recent Belt and Road
   Initiative of Beijing},

Abstract = {This article asks the question whether the Arab Spring protests have had
   a transformative impact on the political regimes of the countries in the
   Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA). Unlike in the Middle East and North
   Africa, the protests that took place in the CCA region after 2011 did
   not result in regime changes. By analysing the political developments in
   the CCA region between the period of 2011 and 2014, this article argues
   that rather than encouraging democratic changes, the Arab Spring
   protests stimulated the learning process of authoritarian rulers in the
   CCA region by showing the impact of the social media for political
   mobilization and consequently regime survival. As such, they
   incentivized the regimes to increase repression, targeting not only the
   protestors, but also media and the Internet freedom.},

   implications of projects that, on the surface, appear to be strikingly
   similar. Taking the case of apparently similar spectacular capital city
   development schemes in the resource-rich states of Central Asia and the
   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), I show that there are significant
   differences in the underlying political geographic and political
   economic factors that makes them possible, as well as the political
   relations they sustain and produce. Like most states around the world,
   foreigners represent a minority of the overall population of the Central
   Asian states, but in the GCC, citizens are in the minority of the
   population in most countries. Because of this political configuration,
   the capital city development schemes are broadly coded as legal and
   legitimate in the Gulf, but illegal and corrupt in Central Asia. By
   honing in on these two different regions, this study shows how the
   state's power to define citizenship, and thus who is entitled to its
   resources, is a tremendously powerful technology of government, which
   hinges on actively constructing a binary between the legal' and
   illegal'.},

Journal = {LANGUAGE LEARNING JOURNAL},
Abstract = {This article explores the effectiveness of a 416-hour professional
   programme intended to support 5010 Kazakhstani teachers in shifting to
   teaching their subjects through English. Document analysis describes the
   perceived intent of the course and how that is reflected in the course
   description and guidelines given to trainers. Document analysis is
   triangulated against 18 hours and 28 minutes of interview and focus
   group data from 74 participants. Data were processed through NVivo for
   thematic analysis to form and develop emergent themes until saturation
   of the data was achieved against these themes. Research findings suggest
   that the implementation of the professional development programme as a
   centralised policy initiative has been approached as a mechanical,
   one-size-fits-all process of mainstreaming a nationwide teacher
   development scheme across all regions of the country. There is a
   considerable divide between programme intentions and delivery. Content
   and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) which is a stated guiding
   principle, is largely absent from documents and interview data.
   Assessment has been flawed from the participants' perspective who do not
   have an objective measure of their progress.},

   Using novel data on bilateral time and cost measures for trade

   Program, this study estimates the trade impact of reducing time and
   costs at border crossing points within CAREC. The gravity model
   estimations show that reducing time by 10\% at the inbound border
   increases trade among CAREC countries by 1 - 2\%. Trade impact of
   reduction in time and costs at the inbound border is estimated to be
   higher than that at the outbound border. We also find that the trade
   impact of reducing time at the inbound border increases with the
   severity of time bottleneck and the trade impact is more effective in

Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {We posit that the investments in political connections made by a firm in
   an emerging market will impact differently its propensity to introduce
   radical and incremental innovations. In addition, we argue that this
   effect will be moderated by alternate non-market firm strategies, such
   as bribery. Using a dataset of more than 9000 firms in 30 emerging
   economies from Eastern Europe and Central Asia we find that political
   connections increase the probability of radical innovation but have no
   significant impact on incremental innovation. Moreover, larger bribing
   reduces the positive impact of political connections on radical
   innovation. Our results confirm the importance of political connections
   for firm activities, but also caution firms on their heterogeneous
   impact on various types of innovations, and their detrimental interplay
   with other non-market strategies.},

Title = {Risks and Strategies of China's Direct Investment in Central Asia from
   the Perspective of Big Data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {With the growth of Chinese economy and the improvement of its
   international status, Chinese enterprises foreign direct investment has
   ushered in new development opportunities. Although scale foreign
   investment continues to expand and has broad development prospects, it
   also faces huge risks that domestic investment has never had. China and
   Central Asia are highly complementary economically. Strengthening direct
   investment in the Central Asian countries can effectually drive China's
   economic development. Based on the quantitative evaluation and analysis
   from the perspective of big data, this paper uses a variety of methods
   to evaluate and explore the risks of China's direct investment in
   Central Asian countries, and gives some policy suggestions. The research
   shows that the motivation of Chinese foreign investment cooperation is
   different from the marginal industry transfer in the traditional
   international investment theory. The problem of country risks in Central
   Asia is prominent. Chinese government must rely on the build of the Belt
   and Road to strengthen intergovernmental communication and exchanges,
   and establish a good cooperation mechanism to deal with the increasingly
   prominent problem of country risks. Further we will improve trade
   facilitation and expand the trade openness of Central Asian countries to
   China. To avoid risks, Chinese companies should invest under the
   guidance of the government and establish a complete investment chain for
   large projects. At the same time, we also need to seize the opportunity
   of the development of digital economy, and gradually establish a
   scientific and efficient investment model to effectively avoid the risk
   of direct investment.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes phenomenon of ``migrant schools{''} and ``migrant
   classes{''} in schools that began to emerge in the 2010s in Siberian
   cities of Tomsk and Irkutsk. The study is based on 120 interviews with
   migrants and 36 express-interviews with parents of children from both
   local families and those that have migrated from Central Asia, as well
   as case studies of four schools in these two cities identified as
   ``migrant{''} by local residents. Despite the ethnic diversity of these
   Siberian cities where most families themselves descend from migrants
   from other regions, the local population singles out new migrants from
   the countries of Central Asia as ``others{''} in the urban space. While
   school administrations, teachers, and parents reproduce the narratives
   of tolerance and ethnic diversity, school segregation persists in these
   cities, manifested, among other things, in the emergence of
   ``migrant{''} schools and ``migrant classes{''} in schools. This study
   presents this segregation as an outcome of strategies pursued by school
   administrators and parents of both local and migrant children. In
   particular, creation of ``migrant{''} classes in some schools is the
   school administrators' response to the lack of adaptation programs for
   migrant children. I conclude that rather than assisting the
   socialization of migrant children, such schools reproduce their
   isolation from other pupils, limiting their ability to succeed in the
   future.},

Abstract = {The growing water crisis in Central Asia (CA) and the complex water
   politics over the region's transboundary rivers have attracted
   considerable attention; however, they are yet to be studied in depth.
   Here, we used the Gini coefficient, water political events, and social
   network analysis to assess the matching degree between water and
   socioeconomic elements and analyze the dynamics of water politics in the
   transboundary river basins of CA. Results indicate that the mismatch
   between water and land resources is a precondition for conflict, with
   the average Gini coefficient between water and population, gross
   domestic product (GDP), and cropland measuring 0.19 (highly matched),
   0.47 (relatively mismatched), and 0.61 (highly mismatched),
   respectively. Moreover, the Gini coefficient between water and cropland
   increased by 0.07 from 1997 to 2016, indicating an increasing mismatch.
   In general, a total of 591 water political events occurred in CA, with
   cooperation accounting for 89 \% of all events. Water events have
   increased slightly over the past 70 years and shown three distinct
   stages, namely a stable period (1951-1991), a rapid increase and decline
   period (1991-2001), and a second stable period (2001-2018). Overall,
   water conflicts mainly occurred in summer and winter. Among the region's
   transboundary river basins, the Aral Sea basin experienced the strongest
   conflicts due to the competitive utilization of the Syr and Amu Darya
   rivers. Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the density
   of water conflictive and cooperative networks in CA increased by 0.18
   and 0.36, respectively. Uzbekistan has the highest degree centrality in
   the conflictive network (6), while Kazakhstan has the highest degree
   centrality in the cooperative network (15), indicating that these two

Abstract = {A U.S.-based political scientist specializing in the complexities of
   international freshwater basins considers the role of two fundamental
   factors (geography and relative power) in the study of hydro-politics.
   Conventional analyses claim that in asymmetric contexts the more
   powerful state (in relative power terms) is able to dictate the status
   quo. Arguing, however, that such traditional (and even some critical)
   analyses tend to downplay the importance of geography, the author
   investigates how a state's physical position along a river may provide
   an otherwise weaker riparian state the means to challenge the status
   quo. The paper considers three cases (Tigris-Euphrates, Nile, and Aral
   Sea basins) with lessons for the study of power in hydro-politics.

Abstract = {In the late Soviet Union, large-scale projects such as the Toktogul Dam

   revealed different opinions about the precise direction and goals of
   Soviet development. Large-scale investments became focal points of
   political and intellectual debates; they not only helped bind the
   periphery closer to the Soviet centre, but also revealed the different
   economic, political and cultural priorities of the regional, republican
   and union-wide actors. The construction of dams and reservoirs
   eventually triggered conflicts between the republics and laid the
   foundation for an anti-colonial critique of the late Soviet state.},

Abstract = {Transboundary water governance, understood as ownership, development and
   management of water resources, has been developing in Central Asia since
   the collapse of the Soviet Union and emergence of national water legal
   systems. However, fairly developed water governance on transboundary
   basins in the region still requires strengthening through enhancing
   riparian states' institutional cooperation at all levels of interstate
   cooperation-regional level, transboundary river basins and bilateral
   level. Joint management arrangements (JMA), which according to
   widespread international legal practice are used to facilitate
   interstate cooperation on transboundary water basins, still pose a
   sufficient challenge to all levels of transboundary water governance in
   Central Asia. The most developed JMA in Central Asia is the mechanism
   represented by International Fund for Saving Aral Sea (IFAS),
   representing all states on the regional level of water governance. Not a
   flawless legal nature of IFAS envisages current challenges to the
   development of JMA at all institutional levels of interstate cooperation
   in Central Asia. Further, it reflects the need for further development
   and strengthening of transboundary water governance in the region.},

Title = {A fixed-mix stochastic fractional programming method for optimizing
   agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation in Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {248},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, a fixed-mix stochastic fractional programming (FSFP)
   method is developed for balancing the water allocation conflict between
   upstream hydropower generation and downstream agricultural irrigation.
   FSFP has advantages in dealing with ratio-objective problem under
   uncertainty, reflecting the dynamic and stochastic characteristics over
   a long-term planning context, as well as analyzing interrelationships
   between system efficiency and violation risk of water-allocation target.
   Then, FSFP is firstly applied to Tuyamuyun reservoir in the lower reach
   of Amu Darya River basin (Central Asia), where multiple scenarios based
   on different hydropower generation targets and inflow levels are
   examined for identifying the complex relationship between hydropower
   generation and crop irrigation. Major findings and managerial insights
   can be summarized as: (i) with the reduction of reservoir inflow, water
   allocation for downstream agricultural irrigation would decrease by
   30.4\% once the minimum demand is satisfied, and hydropower generation
   should be higher priority for pursuing higher marginal benefit; (ii)
   with the shrinking water supply and rising hydropower-generation target,
   cotton planting should be firstly restrained due to its high water
   demand and grape planting is encouraged; (iii) under extreme water
   scarcity (i.e., low and very-low inflow levels), low-level hydropower
   generation target (i.e., alpha = 0.45) is desired for meeting the food
   requirement in the study basin; (iv) for alleviating the water shortage
   during dry seasons, it is recommended that water storage should be
   conducted in autumn and winter, and water release for crop irrigation
   should be implemented during spring and summer. These findings can help
   managers identify sustainable water-allocation schemes for agricultural
   irrigation and hydropower generation against water shortage,
   environmental destruction and energy insecurity in arid regions.},

Abstract = {More than a decade and a half after independence, none of the press
   systems in Central Asia's five former Soviet republics are categorized
   as free, nor have any of these countries transitioned to democracy. The
   question becomes: Why have they failed to evolve into democratic nations
   after successfully rejecting Soviet domination and Russian colonialism?
   The Western-rooted development model assumes that democracy, media
   independence, free markets, and civil society can help establish the
   primary prerequisites for free and prosperous nations. However, the
   results of that assumption fall far short of expectations in Central
   Asia. Recent events provide little reason for optimism about prospects
   for such structural changes. This study discusses the interrelationship
   between press freedom and post-communist democratization. It proposes an
   exploratory matrix of external variables, including religion, that may
   help explain why press freedom has failed to materialize in Central Asia
   while democracy has become a reality in other parts of the former Soviet
   Union and in most former Warsaw Pact nations.},

Abstract = {Researchers have analyzed care policies in the wider Europe in order to
   understand how these may impact labor force decisions of women. We
   extend this analysis to Central Asia, focusing on the emerging gender
   regime in Kazakhstan, which has become a leader in announcing policies
   to facilitate combining family responsibilities with employment. While
   childcare services have expanded rapidly in Kazakhstan, female labor
   force participation has not increased as might have been expected based
   on the European cases. We draw on the data from the EBRD Life in
   Transition Survey from 2006, 2010 and 2016 to examine how motherhood and
   the availability of childcare are related to the employment choices of
   Kazakhstani women. We find that motherhood of very young children is
   strongly associated with a lower likelihood of employment and that the
   availability of childcare does not affect this relationship. Considering
   possible reasons for this and the typology European gender regimes, we
   suggest that greater availability of quality care for children under 2
   and increased support for caring by fathers which would reduce
   opportunity costs of employment for women and could help Kazakhstan
   achieve its goal of increasing gender equity.},

Title = {Open data in Kazakhstan: incentives, implementation and challenges},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {301-323},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the promising
   potential of open data in Kazakhstan to boost public sector innovations
   and trace the emergence of the related civic engagement initiatives in
   order to understand how it affects the democratization of political
   communication processes in a typical developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study research which begins
   with a brief history of the official open data project and then
   investigates various political and socioeconomic drivers, corresponding
   regulatory acts, the leading role of the key stakeholders and policy
   entrepreneurs in the diffusion of the open data movement as well as the
   main challenges associated with the advance of the open government
   concept in Kazakhstan, while various independent open data-driven
   projects provide a rich empirical basis for the analysis.
   Findings - Open data provides new opportunities to promote civic
   engagement and e-participation but does not affect the fundamentals of
   the political system nor advances democratic institutions in a typical
   developing country. The traditional directives could paradoxically be
   effective in advancing open data even in a less collaborative political
   culture. The unitary administrative context is conducive for the
   development of the ICT-driven public sector initiatives as a single
   platform. The existence of independent developers is crucial in
   promoting various open data-driven projects and sharing related
   expertise. The open data movement creates a favorable atmosphere for the
   participation of the non-governmental sector in the sphere.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study is primarily focused
   on the analysis of the open data movement at the national level of
   government, taking into account the unitary structure of the public
   administration system existing in Kazakhstan, which apparently has a
   crucial fundamental effect on the realization of any e-government system
   in this country. In this respect, the main limitation of the research is
   that the possible existence of various open data-driven projects at the
   local levels that hypothetically may have a different set of political
   and socioeconomic drivers and challenges was excluded from the final
   equation, which provides a new window for the future research in the
   area.
   Practical implications - The results of the research could be used by
   e-government practitioners and policymakers in evaluating and improving
   the operation of the open data-driven projects in many developing
   countries.
   Social implications - The author of the paper tried to develop a
   universal framework of the case study research that could be used in
   investigating the open data phenomenon not only in Kazakhstan but also
   in the context of other developing and transitional countries,
   especially in analyzing the apparitional emergence of the unique
   networking activities among the key stakeholders of the open data
   movement, i.e. policymakers, NGOs, businesses, developers, mass media
   and citizens. In addition, the results of the analysis could be used in
   testing the political and socioeconomic implications of the highly
   centralized e-government approach in the realization of the open data
   concept in a number of other typical unitary states.
   Originality/value - In scientific works, the open data phenomenon is
   usually analyzed in the context of the most developed and democratic
   countries of the world with a vast majority of case studies being
   focused only on North America and Europe, forgetting that it is a global
   trend. In contrast to the traditional trends in the academic literature,
   the author of the paper studies the realization of the concept in an
   unusual context, resorting to the case study of a typical emerging and
   post-totalitarian nation such as Kazakhstan and focusing on the analysis
   of the key drivers and challenges in the diffusion of the open data
   concept in an attempt to answer the ultimate question: whether it is
   really harnessed by the members of civil society to promote civic
   engagement and e-participation.},

Abstract = {Despite robust, and much touted, growth, Kazakhstan's economic system
   enjoys only tepid support among large swathes of the population and is

   new wealth and new poverty against a historic background of economic and
   social egalitarianism combine to make this a potent and combustible
   issue. Women, ethnic Slavs, the poor, people in urban areas most
   afflicted by post-Soviet de-industrialisation, those who feel they have
   lost out in the transition to a market economy, and those who are
   pessimistic about their financial prospects are more likely to question
   the legitimacy of the current economic system. Because scepticism about
   the distributive system contributes to political and social strife,
   these findings provide grounds for concern about Kazakhstan's long-term

Abstract = {What is the relationship between trust in religious leaders and
   compliance with policies that are costly to the individual? Religious
   leaders often have the moral authority to affect individuals'
   willingness to adopt prosocial behaviors. Yet, that influence can be
   either positive or negative because religious leaders face mixed
   incentives to encourage compliance and their leadership is often
   decentralized. We argue that greater trust in religious leaders will
   increase compliance in countries with a dominant religion and
   centralized religious authority because religious leaders will offer a
   coherent message that aligns with state directives. We test our
   hypotheses using data from surveys fielded in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find a positive and significant
   relationship between trust and voluntary compliance only in Kazakhstan,
   where religious leaders reduced the costs of compliance by enabling
   adherents to practice their faith while social distancing. We thus
   identify an alternative mechanism whereby trust promotes compliance.},

Journal = {INDIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {206-222},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The article seeks to provide glimpses into the multidimension relations
   with special reference to trade relations that existed between India and
   Central Asia right from ancient times, which reached their climax during
   Mughal times. The article reveals that these relations continued
   unprecedented despite complex geophysical forces, namely formidable
   mountains, undulating deserts, unending plains together with the
   periodical political convulsions especially the triangular rivalry
   between the three mighty powers of the region, i.e., the Mughals of
   India, the Uzbeks of Central Asia and the Safavids of Persia. The study
   of contemporary sources reveals that each power tried at its best to
   encourage the trade by providing safety and security to the trading
   caravans carrying different mercantile. The brisk trade relations
   received a serious jolt when the two regions became part of colonial
   empires, i.e., the Britain and Russia. Though indirect political and
   cultural relations were restored by India with the former Soviet Central
   Asia, yet disintegration of the USSR and the subsequent emergence of
   independent Central Asian states, which, in search of new allies for the
   nation-building process, establishment of market economy and democratic
   set up, offered a golden opportunity to India, being an immediate
   neighbour in the region, for restoring and reviving its historical
   legacy. The historical study carried out in this article intends to
   provide insights into twenty-first-century Indian policy planers for
   establishing strong multidimensional relations for regional cooperation
   and sustainable development, apart from maintaining balance of political

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of international migration on the
   schooling and labour outcomes of left-behind children in rural
   Tajikistan. Using three-wave panel survey data, I rely on an
   instrumental variable strategy to address the non-random selection into
   migration. I identify important and gender-differenced schooling and
   labour supply responses. My findings suggest that boys living in migrant
   households are less likely to lag behind at school or work. At the
   intensive margin, they also report fewer hours of work per week. On the
   other hand, left-behind teenage females undertake a higher number of
   domestic chores. They appear to marry earlier as well. The migration
   impact on boys appears to be driven by remittances and the improved
   financial situation of households. The absence of any positive influence
   on the education of left-behind girls is likely to be explained by
   Tajikistan's cultural norms and institutions.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Nature-Related Transactions and Governance
   Structures in Pasture Use and IrrigationWater in Central Asia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Central Asian countries have experienced a transition from a centralized
   state-managed economy to a decentralized market-oriented one, and gained
   valuable experience in designing institutions involving common-pool
   resource (CPR) management. Top-down policy interventions have affected
   natural resource usage practices and had environmental, social and
   economic consequences. On the other hand, in a bottom-up transformation
   process, many informal practices for using local resources and many
   forms of cooperation have emerged and become institutionalized, adapting
   to the changing socio-economic context. This paper demonstrates an
   empirical application of the Institutions of Sustainability (IoS)
   framework, analyzing these emerged institutions, and governance
   structures in pasture and irrigation management. It studies how the
   physical nature-related transactions are institutionalized through the
   operationalization of a discriminative alignment principle. The research
   results show that actors' interdependencies caused by the attributes of
   nature-related transactions play a decisive role in institutional
   development in CPR management in Central Asia. The authors argue that
   differences in the properties of physical nature-related transactions in
   pasture and irrigation water use can be linked and explained through
   differences in the key characteristics of governance structures.},

Abstract = {Since September 11, 2001, and the subsequent U.S. politico-military

   to have compromised China's long-term plans regarding the integration of
   Xin-jiang. This paper however will argue that the strategic implications
   of the U.S. penetration of Central Asia have in fact resulted in the
   re-invigoration and reinforcement of China's goal and instruments of
   integration in Xinjiang. This dynamic has been expressed within
   Xinjiang, in the form of the strengthening of the major instruments of
   internal control and development, and externally in the form of China's
   foreign policy calculus in the context of its relations with the states
   of Central Asia.},

Title = {Destination Attractiveness and Memorable Travel Experiences in Silk Road
   Tourism in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study explored the relationships between destination
   attractiveness, satisfaction, the sense of reliving, and loyalty among
   American tourists who had experienced Silk Road tourism in Uzbekistan.
   In addition, this study investigated the mediating role of the sense of
   reliving with regard to satisfaction and loyalty. A total of 477
   respondents participated and were used for the final analysis. The
   results suggest that destination attractiveness includes
   multidimensional constructs consisting of five dimensions, namely,
   cultural attractiveness, natural attractiveness, the local people and
   superstructure, infrastructure, and price attractiveness. Cultural
   attractiveness, the warm hospitality of local people, and the
   superstructure appear to be the competitive attributes of Silk Road
   tourism in Uzbekistan affecting tourist satisfaction. Furthermore, the
   results reveal that tourist satisfaction increases loyalty. A mediating
   role of the sense of reliving with regard to satisfaction and loyalty
   was also confirmed. Tourists remember their travel experiences upon
   returning home, relive Silk Road travel experiences, and demonstrate
   their behavioral intentions. These findings can provide a deeper
   understanding of destination attractiveness and memorable experiences
   for increasing loyalty to destinations related to Silk Road tourism in
   Uzbekistan.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-37},
Abstract = {After gaining independence, Tajikistan undergoes explosive reform.
   However, applied analysis of the conducted macroeconomic policy was not
   carried per se. This paper is filling this gap by conducting
   quantitative analysis of money demand, which is instrument of economic
   development. The main objective of this paper is to estimate stability
   of the money demand function in Tajikistan and provide an empirical
   analysis of factors that influence money demand. This analysis has done
   on the base of standard approach such as the ARDL Bound Test approach
   and vector error-correction model with the main objective to determine
   the factors which, in both short-and long-term, influence its movements.
   The findings of ARDL bound testing confirms the long run relationship
   between all type of money demand, economic activities, exchange rate and
   price level. Further, we found instability of the money demand function
   under reviewed sample. The bidirectional causality between aggregated
   money demand, economic activity, exchange rate has been noticed. The
   empirical analysis suggests that the money demand is unstable, one of
   the reasons being the dynamic nature of changes in the financial system
   of Tajikistan and could not be used for the purpose of targeting
   monetary aggregates. Copyright (c) 2018 JAEBR},

Abstract = {A recent child-work study by the International Labour Organization
   reports that 27\% of children in Tajikistan ages 5-17 worked in 2013.
   Although children worked in agriculture or performed household chores in
   Soviet Tajikistan, child work for pay is a relatively new phenomenon in
   modern Tajikistan. This study examines the pathways to child work and
   the families' perceptions of child work experiences. Some of the main
   findings of this study are the themes connected to normalization and
   acceptance of child work in Tajikistan. These are explained by
   expectations placed on children at the social, family and personal
   levels that are in turn affected by macroeconomic forces that are
   by-products of the transitional economy. The study also explores
   differences in expectations by gender, age and area of residence.},

   15years become a prime example of the increasing impact of China's rapid
   development in this structurally and politically weak post-Soviet state
   and in relation to its people. Chinese-made consumer goods, worth
   several billions of US dollars annually, have been re-exported overland
   via Kyrgyzstan to wholesale and retail clients across Eurasia. However,
   the hardening of the state border to the north, and particularly
   following the foundation of a tripartite customs union (CU) including
   Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus in the same year, has threatened the
   livelihoods of numerous trade entrepreneurs at the bazaar. Given
   Kyrgyzstan's recent accession to the newly formed Eurasian Economic
   Union (EEU) in May 2015, it makes sense to re-evaluate local
   representations and future perspectives on China's powerful commercial
   expansion into Central Asia. Based on several months of ethnographic
   fieldwork in Bishkek between 2012 and 2015, this article analyzes the
   dynamic socioeconomic effects of China's trade and transport policy on
   trade entrepreneurs in Kyrgyzstan. It outlines how China's commercial
   dominance in the neighboring state, albeit discussed controversially and
   often running up against nationalist anti-Chinese sentiments, have
   strongly influenced Kyrgyzstani trade entrepreneurs' interaction with
   Chinese partners and their strategies of doing business at and beyond
   the bazaar - as will be demonstrated herein through the example of
   Bishkek's emerging apparel industry. This article also illuminates the
   ways Dordoi's trade entrepreneurs make sense of the uncertainties after
   Kyrgyzstan's accession to the EEU.},

Title = {A mob for hire? Unpacking older women's political activism in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-264},
Abstract = {This article explores the politics of older women in post-Soviet
   Kyrgyzstan, who have emerged as informal leaders in urban neighbourhoods
   to `speak for the poor' to the state. Their mediating role is crucial
   for understanding community micro-politics, women's political agency and
   more broadly state-society relations in the post-Soviet context. Drawing
   on in-depth interviews with older female informal leaders, the paper
   examines their political legitimacy and modes of mediation with the
   state and elites. Using Bourdieu's concepts of political capital and
   `double dealings', the paper argues that older women are important
   informal mediators, whose representational practices involve communal
   leadership, protest activism, bargaining and vote mobilization. Their
   multitasking roles are necessitated by their legitimation struggles and
   elites' strategies of state capture. The article challenges the dominant
   media representation of older women activists as `a mob for hire' and
   offers a more nuanced account of older women's politics, addressing a
   blind spot in the literature on politics in Central Asia.},

   of the history of water-sharing agreements in the Isfara Basin is
   presented. The paper reveals that there have been fierce negotiations
   and renegotiations even during the Soviet Union period between the
   Central Asian riparian republics; agreement was reached mainly though
   engineering solutions that brought more water to the basin. The paper
   highlights that although water-sharing agreements were reached early on,
   the technical capability of implementing these agreements was lacking.
   Similarly, even after independence, agreements had been reached but lack
   of water control hindered their implementation.},

Abstract = {This article contrasts the World Bank's policy-oriented, standardized
   assessment of the business climate and small business in Tajikistan with
   an alternative, bottom-up reading of local entrepreneurship focused on
   the life stories and business experiences of the young Tajik business
   community. It shows that the World Bank's business evaluations and
   rankingsDoing Business and Enterprise Survey, offer a top-down
   understanding of business in this post-Soviet Central Asian country,
   which is filtered through an underlying neoliberal policy paradigm. This
   paradigm promotes economic liberalization, rivalry and individual
   responsibility for wellbeing at the expense of a welfare state,
   solidarity and common interest. The article proposes a different account
   which is centered on the socio-economic, political and moral
   embeddedness of local business practices. Four aspects of doing business
   are analyzed: informality, the role of the state in regulating business,
   bribing, and the relevance of social networks. Such an alternative,
   ethnographically informed account is needed because this organization's
   publications are seen by policymakers as an authoritative source of
   knowledge and, as a result, serve as a powerful global governance tool
   influencing economic reforms worldwide. These reforms, however, often
   exercise a negative effect on local economic lifeworlds.},

   concept of yntymak is brought forth as a vital practice of organization
   and place-making in and against adversarial attempts at governance.
   Reconfiguring politics around specific community practices exposes the
   utilitarian shortcomings of neoliberal governance methods and typical

Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {314-353},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This article is a foray into the understudied issue of environmental
   protest politics in Central Asia. Specifically, it uses Kyrgyzstan as a
   case study to test the argument that environmental concerns mobilized
   people to engage in protest and in ways different from other kinds of
   protest. This essay presents the first systematic study of public
   opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a
   2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and
   newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these
   results to identify geographical variation in public perception and
   political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex
   process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not
   explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances.
   Eco-mobilization - collective political action about the environment -
   represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into
   mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial
   societies. The study finds that these political actions about the
   environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic
   foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and
   demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior.},

Abstract = {This paper is based on evidence gathered in 20 firms, matched by size
   and business sector, in each of three Central Asia cities - Almaty in
   Kazakhstan, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, and Samarkand in Uzbekistan. In each
   firm the owner(s) and/or senior managers supplied information about the
   business, focusing on methods of recruitment, training, and employee
   career development. Parallel questionnaire surveys gathered information
   about the family and educational backgrounds, and labour market and
   employment biographies, of all the young (up to age 30) employees in
   each of the 20 companies. A total of 1,402 young employees completed
   questionnaires, and from these, eight per city, with equal numbers of
   males and females, with and without higher education, were subsequently
   interviewed in depth. The evidence is used to identify how families that
   were advantaged under the old (communist) system were continuing to
   reproduce their advantages inter-generationally. It is shown that this
   was mainly, though not entirely, via their children's superior chances
   of progressing through higher education. The evidence is also used to
   argue that cultural capital was playing a stronger role than social
   capital in the inter-generational transmission of advantages, that the
   critical events in the potentially life-long status attainment process
   were concentrated within a relatively short time frame, and that the
   multiple strategies to which families with economic and cultural assets
   could resort were liable to neutralise all efforts to diminish their
   ability to pass their advantages down the generations.},

Title = {Building plausible futures: Scenario-based strategic planning of
   industrial development of Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Industrial development is often considered to be a major engine of
   economic growth. Kyrgyzstan is an open, small, landlocked, developing
   economy in Central Asia. In 2018 the Government of Kyrgyzstan decided to
   elaborate a new industrial development strategy that would facilitate
   economic growth, reduce the country's dependence on foreign financing,
   and increase the welfare of inhabitants. This paper presents a set of
   plausible scenarios of industrial development of Kyrgyzstan to 2040. The
   scenarios were used as a basis for a Strategy for the Sustainable
   Development of Industry in Kyrgyzstan for 2019-2023, prepared by
   co-authors of this paper in collaboration with local experts in 2018.
   This strategy was officially adopted by the Government of Kyrgyzstan in
   September 2019. To construct scenarios, we used an approach developed by
   Roland Berger and Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL) Center for
   Strategy and Scenario Planning within the Intuitive Logics scenario
   planning paradigm. This approach relies on a systematic step-by-step
   scenario-building process that can be carried out when time and
   resources are limited. We augmented this approach by revealing and
   utilizing causal relationships among drivers. We also considered a
   denser spectrum of scenarios. The outcomes of each scenario planning
   step were validated in consultations with local stakeholders. We also
   designed a monitoring dashboard based on well-established publicly
   available development indicators. These can help policymakers identify
   which scenario the system under consideration is tending toward, so that
   necessary policy interventions can be executed in a timely manner.},

Title = {The Effects of Ecological Policy of Kyrgyzstan Based on Data Envelope
   Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan is located in the runoff formation area of Aral Sea basin.
   The ecological protection of this country has a great effect on the
   downstream and Aral Sea conservation. There were a few studies about
   this region carried out from ecological policy aspects. The aim of this
   study was two-fold. First, we characterized the eco-policy system
   structure of Kyrgyzstan in different stages. It means the transition
   from command and control to market-based ecological policy. The priority
   of ecological policy was changed from sustain economic growth and
   poverty reduction to sustainable development and green economy. We then
   used a data envelope analysis method to evaluate the effects of
   eco-policy and government governance through eco-efficiency. The results
   are that (1) the eco-efficiency achieved the relative optimal state and
   the ecological policy obtained a relatively positive effect as a whole;
   (2) economic development promotes the protection of the ecological
   environment. It is the first time that quantitative method has been used
   to analyze the effects of ecological policy of Kyrgyzstan. The model
   results can reflect comprehensive effects of ecological policy in
   social, economic, and ecological aspects. This study provides a
   reference for those who want to shape the next generation of
   eco-environmental policies both in Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian
   countries.},

Abstract = {Tajikistan has relied on remittances by international migrants that have
   exceeded a quarter of annual GDP to date, despite a series of exogenous
   adverse events in the mid-2010s. We use a nationally representative
   panel dataset collected in 2013 and 2018 to explore the socio-economic
   characteristics of households with international migrants and migrants
   themselves. We provide several new findings. First, the prevalence of
   households with international migrants is 40\%, with a substantial
   transition in migrant status during the research period. Second,
   households with international migrants are not poor, have
   Russian-speaking members, and are supported by an intense migration
   network. Third, younger, single, and more educated males comprise most
   of Tajikistan's international migrants. Fourth, households without
   Russian-speaking members or migration networks in 2013 had begun to send
   international migrants by 2018, while households in the richest group
   had exited from migration, suggesting s transition of the socio-economic
   composition of migrant-sending households during the mid-2010s.},

Title = {Defending Civic Space: Successful Resistance Against NGO Laws in Kenya
   and Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {84-94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Since the turn of the century, an increasing number of governments
   around the world has introduced or tightened restrictions on civil
   society organizations (CSOs). Attempts by local CSOs and external actors
   to counter this trend of shrinking civic spaces have been mostly
   unsuccessful. In a few notable cases, however, civic space restrictions
   have been reversed or even prevented from being adopted in the first
   place. Focusing on resistance to so-called NGO laws, this paper explores
   the strategies, causal mechanisms and scope conditions that help explain
   the successful defense of civic space. In a first step, the paper
   develops a theoretical framework by drawing on research on the diffusion
   and promotion of international norms, civic resistance and social
   movements. Second, it looks at two cases - Kenya (2013) and Kyrgyzstan
   (2013-2016) - in which governmental attempts to impose legal
   restrictions on foreign-funded NGOs were effectively aborted. The
   analysis finds that successful resistance in both cases was based on
   domestic campaigns organized by broad alliances of local CSOs, which
   were able to draw on preexisting mobilizing structures and put forward a
   socioeconomic narrative to lobby against civic space restrictions. In
   Kyrgyzstan, but not in Kenya, external actors also played a significant
   role.},

   development. Their status improved with the establishment of a permanent
   Russian base in Khorog in 1895, but it was not until the full
   incorporation of the region into the Soviet Union that the development
   process began. The achievements were remarkable - the region was
   intended by the Russians to be perceived as a model of socialist
   achievements for the attention of neighbouring Moslem populations - but,
   after the break-up of the Soviet Union, proved ultimately to be
   non-sustainable. Thanks to the intervention of the Aga Khan Foundation
   from the time of the Tajik Civil War in 1992-1993, innovative programmes
   were introduced to address the most urgent problems and, subsequently,
   to lay the groundwork for more sustainable policies in the future. Major
   challenges remain.},

Abstract = {This paper uses differences in regional and temporal exposure to the
   1992-1998 armed conflict in Tajikistan to study the effect of violent
   conflict on schooling outcomes. Data on the past damage to a household's
   residences from the 1999 Tajik Living Standards Survey is used as well
   as data on the events during the conflict within a conceptual framework
   that controls for important individual, household and community
   characteristics. Girls who were of school age during the conflict and
   lived in affected regions were less likely to complete their mandatory
   schooling than girls of the same age who lived in the regions relatively
   unaffected by conflict. The results also indicate that exposure to
   violent conflict had a large and statistically significant negative
   effect on the enrollment of girls. No effect of regional and household
   conflict exposure on education of boys was found. The results are robust
   to community and household fixed effects, selection into violence and
   migration. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether remittances from international migration
   impact on the occupational choice of left-behind youth in Kyrgyzstan.
   Labor supply is analyzed both at the extensive and intensive margins
   using cross-sectional data for 2011. To overcome endogeneity concerns,
   an instrumental variable approach was implemented. Findings demonstrate
   that migration, rather than remittances, pushes the left-behind youth to
   become unpaid family workers. This is explained by the substitution
   effect as the youth left behind are called upon to replace the migrant
   labor. Moreover, this effect is heterogeneous - female youth are more
   inclined to becoming unpaid family workers both at the extensive and
   intensive margins.},

Title = {When IOM encounters the field: localising the migration and development

Abstract = {This article analyses localisation of the migration and development
   paradigm, promoted worldwide by the International Organization for
   Migration (IOM), by unpacking transformations that this approach
   undergoes in aid-receiving countries assisted by this organisation.
   Drawing on insights from International Relations and the anthropology of
   development, and taking the case of a specific policy transfer initiated
   by IOM in post-Soviet Tajikistan, which involved setting up a local
   state-operated labour recruitment system for industries abroad, the
   article advances three arguments. First, the crucial relevance of actors
   in the field, namely brokers who arrange and navigate IOM's
   collaborations with various actors on the ground, reveals that the
   authority of IOM in Tajikistan is personalised and relational, rather
   than institutional. Second, the existence of brokers points to an
   ideological heterogeneity within IOM, which on the surface seems united
   in its pursuit of the migration and development agenda. Third, this
   article problematises the role of IOM in Tajikistan, showing that the
   organisation interferes in state-citizens relations and that its
   rhetoric of migration and development justifies a market-tailored export
   of local labour, serving the global capitalist economy. The article
   contributes to research on IOM, as well as global-local interactions and
   international organisations in the field.},

Title = {Participation and Compliance in Tension: Developing Women-led Yarn
   Spinning Businesses in Tajikistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES},
Abstract = {This paper presents a case study on two consecutive 4-year projects
   funded by IFAD that used participatory action research (PAR) to develop
   women-led yarn spinning businesses in rural Tajikistan. The case study
   explains how the PAR approach contributed to the project success and how
   it was affected by different compliance environments. The first project,
   managed by ICARDA, operated in an enabling compliance environment that
   supported field-level action based on a PAR-driven learning. The second
   project, managed by AKF, faced a high-burden compliance environment that
   affected field-level decision-making and created unforeseen costs for
   the project. The paper argues that cooperative learning and
   decision-making by the field staff and the stakeholders, facilitated by
   low burden compliance, is a cornerstone of effective, sustainable
   development. High-burden compliance systems can jeopardise project
   effectiveness and sustainability by prioritising procedural conformity
   over participatory, knowledge-based action.},

Title = {Is poverty predictable with machine learning? A study of DHS data from
   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A prerequisite for eliminating poverty is to accurately identify and
   target the households in poverty. While some factors such as asset
   holdings are well recognized as relevant for assessing and predicting
   poverty, a priori selected indicators are not sufficient conditions for
   poverty and the key factors may vary from one case to another.
   Researchers have begun to apply machine learning algorithms to predict
   poor households. This paper uses the accuracy of prediction as the
   standard to study the application of machine learning algorithms. Using
   the DHS data of 8040 households in Kyrgyzstan, we apply a
   state-of-the-art algorithm (XGBoost) to explore the full dataset,
   profiting from the algorithm's ability in handling many variables, and
   compare the results with the a priori selected variables. We also
   compare XGBoost with generalized linear model (GLM), the latter being
   viewed as an approach in between traditional models and modern machine
   learning algorithms. The results imply that the inclusion of more
   variables is not necessarily preferable for prediction; a few important
   variables selected by the algorithms may also perform well. Different
   algorithms may select different variables as the important ones for
   prediction. XGBoost performs better than GLM in most cases, and machine
   learning is useful for variable selection. Additionally, XGBoost is
   particularly preferable when using a priori variables.},

Title = {System Dynamics Modeling of Water Level Variations of Lake Issyk-Kul,
   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lake Issyk-Kul is an important endorheic lake in arid Central Asia.
   Climate change, anthropogenic water consumption and a complex basin
   hydrology with interlocked driving forces have led to a high variability
   of the water balance and an overall trend of decreasing lake water
   levels. The main objective of this study was to investigate these main
   driving forces and their interactions with the lake's water level.
   Hydro-meteorological and socioeconomic data from 1980 to 2012 were used
   for a dynamic simulation model, based on the system dynamics (SD)
   method. After the model calibration and validation with historical data,
   the model provides accurate simulation results of the water level of
   Lake Issyk-Kul. The main factors impacting the lake's water level were
   evaluated via sensitivity analysis and water resource scenarios. Results
   based on the sensitivity analysis indicated that socio-hydrologic
   factors had different influences on the lake water level change, with
   the main influence coming from the water inflow dynamic, namely, the
   increasing and decreasing water withdrawal from lake tributaries. Land
   use changes, population increase, and water demand decrease were also
   important factors for the lake water level variations. Results of four
   scenario analyses demonstrated that changes in the water cycle
   components as evaporation and precipitation and the variability of river
   runoff into the lake are essential parameters for the dynamic of the
   lake water level. In the future, this SD model can help to better manage
   basins with water availability uncertainties and can guide policymakers
   to take necessary measures to restore lake basin ecosystems.},

Title = {Migration and animal husbandry: Competing or complementary livelihood
   strategies.Evidence from Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-221},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Animal husbandry and labour migration are important livelihood
   strategies for a large proportion of the rural population in developing
   countries. Up to now, the two strategies have usually been studied by
   looking at either one or the other; their interlinkages have rarely been
   examined. Based on a case study in rural Kyrgyzstan, the aim of this
   paper is to explore the links between animal husbandry and labour
   migration. Results show that for most rural households, livestock is
   crucial yet not sufficient to make a living. Therefore, many people
   diversify their income sources by migrating to work elsewhere. This
   generates cash for daily expenses and the acquisition of new livestock,
   but also leads to an absence of workforce in households. Yet since
   remittances usually exceed the expenses for hiring additional workforce,
   most people consider migration profitable. From a socio-economic point
   of view, migration and animal husbandry can thus be considered important
   complementary livelihood strategies for the rural Kyrgyz population, at
   least for the time being. In the long term, however, the failure of
   young migrants to return to rural places and their settlement in urban
   areas might also cause remittance dependency and lead to an increasing
   lack of qualified labour. From an environmental point of view, the
   investment of remittances into animal husbandry poses challenges to
   sustainable pasture management. Increasing livestock numbers in rural
   areas raise pressure on pasture resources. Since most people consider
   animal husbandry their main future prospect while continuing to use
   pastures in a fairly unsustainable way, this may further exacerbate the
   over-utilization of pastures in future.},

Title = {Performance Evaluation of the Government Agencies of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {NISPACEE JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Performance evaluation of the government agencies seems to be one of the
   most important issues in modern public administration. The countries
   with developed economies introduced various performance evaluation
   models. The developing countries also implement instruments to evaluate
   the government agencies performance. Unlike countries with developed
   institutional environments, the developing ones very often import
   evaluation models that have been proven in other countries. In that
   context, our research aimed to understand how the performance evaluation
   models work in countries with a developing institutional environment.
   The fact is that the performance evaluation of the government agencies
   shows certain results which present it in a positive way to the public.
   Unfortunately, these survey results do not adequately cover difficulties
   and obstacles that appear in the performance evaluation introduction
   process. In this regard, the perception of the evaluation system by the
   first-hand (civil servants), as well as the end entities (NGO
   representatives) of how the introduction of the evaluation institute
   contributes to improving the effectiveness of government agencies need
   to be analyzed.
   This article presents an analysis of the impact performance evaluation
   on performance in government agencies of Kazakhstan through interviews
   with civil servants (insiders), as they are aware of administrative
   changes, and representatives of NGO that closely interact with
   government agencies, so they can really assess the effect of changes.
   Data collected by quantitative and qualitive methods, such as
   legislative analysis, mass survey, in-depth interviews of civil servants
   and NGOs, and focus groups. The authors took into account all the
   limitations that are typical for surveys of civil servants in countries
   with a developing institutional environment (e.g. Nemec et al. 2011).
   In general, the research results provide a wider understanding of the
   effectiveness of institutional changes when embedding NPM tools into the
   administrative reforms through a ``top-down approach{''} in emerging
   economies. The results show that the implementation of a new institution
   (performance evaluation) into the existing structure of formal
   institutions of the government agencies was accomplished. It was found
   that implanting a new institution caused, to some extent, a short-term
   ``shock{''} to the government agencies, as there since previously there
   were no objective criteria for evaluating their activity. At the same
   time, performance evaluation is still not unincorporated into the
   internal management system in government agencies. It is perceived as a
   redundant imputed data transfer function for external evaluators. For
   this reason, top management of government agencies does not involve all
   staff in the process of evaluating and discussing its results. However,
   employees show interest in participating in these processes. All this
   once again confirms that the post-Soviet countries are still in networks
   of past heritage, namely they preserve a centralized bureaucratic system
   controlled from above.},

Title = {Knowledge Gaps and Rural Development in Tajikistan: Agricultural
   Advisory Services as a Panacea?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION \& EXTENSION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-41},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse knowledge systems and
   channels of innovation diffusion in Tajikistan. In particular, I look at
   the formation of agricultural advisory services (AASs) and how these
   provide a vital source of knowledge and innovation for farmers during
   the transition process.
   Methodology: Empirically, this paper draws on qualitative, ethnographic
   research in the agricultural sector of Tajikistan, that is,
   semi-structured and in-depth interviews with agricultural experts, and a
   `farm diary' that provided data on farmers' perspectives regarding
   access to knowledge and expertise.
   Findings: Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the civil
   war in Tajikistan, knowledge available to farmers can be described as a
   mix of traces and fragments originating from the Soviet agricultural and
   educational system represented by universities, research institutes and
   academies of science, on the one hand, and Western-style knowledge,
   mainly introduced by development agencies, on the other. Donors are
   relatively new actors in the field of knowledge dissemination, but they
   are nevertheless very important ones. Under the `development' framework,
   that is, rhetorical, organisational and infrastructural development,
   different donors play their own parts, some of them geo-political. At
   the same time they provide support for the functioning of local
   non-governmental organisations and help to maintain them accordingly,
   and they are also used by Tajik political actors for their own purposes.
   Practical implications: From this discussion, practical suggestions are
   made on how AASs could be organised in Tajikistan, namely on existing
   assets, traditions and networks, thus reflecting the interplay between
   the main actors and local needs.},

Abstract = {Since the fall of the USSR, Turkmenistan has made some progress in the
   development of its national economy and its ability to attract foreign
   investment. Although Turkmenistan is considered an attractive
   destination due to its rich natural resources, the country's FDI regime,
   including its admission procedures, lacks transparency and
   predictability. From the perspective of foreign investors, the host
   state's FDI regime plays a crucial role. Without considering a host
   state's FDI regime, foreign investors may be at risk of losing their
   investment due to lack of transparency or an unpredictable legal
   environment. Requirements related to the admission of foreign investment
   may differ between countries. Unlike most countries, which usually limit
   the scope of admission requirements (national security concerns),
   Turkmenistan's FDI regime imposes stricter requirements on foreign
   investors during the entry process. It is understandable that
   Turkmenistan may expect to maximize the benefit of foreign investment
   while minimizing its negative effects on the national economy. However,
   a lack of clear and transparent admission requirements leaves a large
   amount of discretion with various administrative bodies. This makes
   admission requirements unpredictable and dissuades foreign investors
   from investing in the host country. This article scrutinizes the
   admission requirements related to foreign investment in the entry stage
   in the Turkmenistan FDI regime.},

Abstract = {In December 2015, leaders from Central and South Asia took part in the
   ground-breaking ceremony for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India
   (TAPI) natural gas pipeline project. Sixteen months later, a confusing
   information flow continues to obfuscate external assessments of the
   project's development: official rhetoric notwithstanding, there is no
   certainty on the details of project financing, while the pipeline route
   has yet to be determined. To illuminate this obscure implementation
   path, this article regards TAPI as a virtual pipeline, an infrastructure
   project that wields invaluable influence only when it is employed as a
   foreign policy tool or permeates domestic discourses of progress framed
   by the elites of the four consortium partners. The constituent elements
   of TAPI virtuality are discussed here through a dedicated focus on the
   process of energy policy-making of Turkmenistan - the sole supplier of
   gas for the pipeline project and the consortium's key stakeholder.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {This article, using contemporary Kyrgyzstan as a case study, examines
   how state weakness is both reflected and reinforced at the citizens'
   level. Based upon field research conducted in April and May 2007, we
   discuss three hypotheses. First, the inability of the state to provide
   essential goods and services and has deterred citizens' willingness to
   fulfill their responsibilities such as paying taxes, respecting the
   laws, and serving in the army. Second, citizens have lost trust in their
   regime; some directly confront the state by joining demonstrations,
   strikes, and other protest activities. Finally, state weakness has
   negatively influenced the feeling of collective membership and
   reinforced sub-national identities. Declining loyalty is particularly
   evident among the citizens who have left the country in the prospect of
   better employment abroad. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {This article analyses women's participation in life-cycle, religious,
   and propitiatory rituals in Uzbekistan against the background of the
   `politicization' of custom under the Soviet regime and fluctuations in
   official policies towards Islam since the post-Soviet period. Despite
   changes in official discourse, the resilience of women's rituals may be
   explained in terms of their embeddedness in local notions of communal
   participation and their role in the day-to-day reproduction of communal
   life. In the post-Soviet period, ritual has become a site both for the
   assertion of authentic Uzbek identity and for the display of growing
   disparities in wealth and status through the medium of consumption,
   leading to propaganda campaigns against ostentation. Although the
   thinking behind these initiatives is very different front that of Soviet
   modernizers, they, too, place ritual life at the centre of Uzbek
   sociality and target women as the custodians of local custom.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a unique representative household budget survey from the
   Asian Development Bank to analyze the impact of international migration
   and remittances on crop income of rural farmers in the Kyrgyz Republic.
   Unlike other studies we allow the impact of remittances to be different
   for farmers with different land size and test whether reduced labor
   availability is more relevant for permanent than for seasonal migrants.
   We find that losing family members has a significant negative effect on
   crop income, but only for permanent migrants. Remittances partially
   compensate for this, but their positive impact decreases with farm size.

Abstract = {We investigate the impact of international labour migrants' remittances
   on household expenditures in Uzbekistan as an understudied case of
   South-South migration. In doing so, we use instrumental variable
   regressions to address endogeneity caused by self-selection bias. We
   find that remittance-receiving households spend a significantly smaller
   part of their budgets on food and health. This finding contrasts with
   studies of South-South remittances in Africa that find that households
   tend to spend most of their remittance incomes on food. Our estimations
   also provide evidence that remittance-receiving households spend a
   larger part of their total expenditures on non-food consumption.
   Remittances' impact on healthcare expenditures is negative and on
   education expenditures is insignificant. These results support the view
   that remittances in this South-South migration corridor are channelled
   mainly to consumer goods, limiting their contribution to economic
   development.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the magnitude of differences in child and adult
   mortality by wealth in Uzbekistan a former soviet country of Central
   Asia and compares it with similar indicators from sub-Saharan Africa
   Data were derived from Demographic and Health Surveys An Absolute Wealth
   Index was built from data on goods owned by households and quality of
   housing and scaled from 0 to 12 Wealth was distributed evenly in
   Uzbekistan with a symmetric distribution around a mean of 5 5 modern
   goods In sub-Saharan Africa on the contrary the wealth distribution had
   a lower mean (2 5) and was highly skewed towards the left revealing a
   high proportion of very poor people Adult and child mortality levels
   were lower in Uzbekistan Despite these major differences the
   relationships between mortality indicators and the wealth index were
   similar in the two cases The magnitude of mortality differentials by
   wealth was of the same order in both cases with gradients ranging from 2
   5 to 1 for child mortality and 1 5 to 1 for adult mortality (poorest
   versus richest) However mortality levels remained lower in Uzbekistan
   than in sub-Saharan Africa at the same level of wealth for both children
   and adults A similar relationship was found between nutritional status
   and wealth index in both cases On the contrary there were no differences
   by wealth in use of health services and level of education in Uzbekistan
   whereas wealth gradients were steep for the same variables in

Abstract = {The increasing use of ICT in education results in advantages for
   teaching and learning processes. In countries, especially in developing
   ones, it is essential to examine stakeholders' experiences and
   perceptions about ICT use in the courses. In this regard, this study
   firstly aims to investigate ICT use of Kyrgyz learners and teachers.
   Secondly, the study aims to examine learners' and teachers' perceptions
   with regard to ICT use in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
   Mathematics (STEM) courses in high schools in the Kyrgyz Republic. In
   the context of the study, two different questionnaires were applied. The
   first questionnaire was applied to high school learners, and the second
   questionnaire was applied to high school teachers. Participants of the
   study are 470 learners, and 162 STEM teachers. The results revealed
   frequencies of Internet and video use, the devices learners employ for
   Internet access, and online applications they prefer to use. Learners'
   perceptions of ICT use in STEM courses differ according to their grade
   levels, type of preparation for the course, and willingness to use
   online Kyrgyz language resources. The results also explored the
   difficulties that teachers experience in the courses, the course
   materials they use, and their expectations related to ICT use in the
   courses. The crucial problems of Kyrgyz teachers are lack of ICT based
   materials, lack of equipment, and lack of training.},

Title = {Ordered to volunteer? Institutional compatibility assessment of
   establishing agricultural cooperatives in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In places where state has been historically the most dominant actor of
   all reforms, it can be particularly chal-lenging to develop non-state
   forms of organization and governance such as agricultural cooperatives
   known to reduce transaction costs and utilize economies of scale. This
   paper explores the latest state policy on the development of
   agricultural cooperatives in Uzbekistan through the prism of its
   compatibility with the existing institutional conditions. An exploratory
   case study approach was used to conduct interviews with representatives
   of key actors involved in the policy formulation at the national scale
   and its implementation in two pilot provinces. Applying the analytical
   instruments of the procedure for institutional compatibility assessment
   (PICA) on the one hand and based on empirical insights from in-depth
   interviews (n = 22) and internal policy docu-ments on the other hand, we
   have identified a set of crucial institutional aspects (CIAs) and their
   relative importance for the establishment of the cooperatives in
   Uzbekistan. In addition to the incompatibility of an excessively and
   exclusively regulatory nature of the intervention with the desired
   voluntary form of co-operatives' organization, we find that main sources
   of the policy (in-)compatibility lie within the degrees of information
   asymmetry, farmers' trust towards the state, and the capacity of the
   authorities. Although the state's top-down approach was effective at
   quickly establishing the cooperatives formally, most farmers were
   informed about the policy only symbolically, who then remained largely
   skeptical about its value, and considered the state responsible for its
   implementation. The findings highlight the need for a change in broader
   institutional envi-ronment and allowing time for learning and
   internalization of self-organization principles by farmers in order to
   make the economic advantages of cooperatives possible.},

   emancipatory dynamic, leading to new forms of coproducing knowledge,

   provoked a 1.6\% rise in per capita GDP and a 0.48\% decrease in poverty
   levels in Tajikistan. Despite the increased relevance of South-South
   Cooperation in Tajikistan, the current bilateral cooperation pattern
   does not allow us to think South-South aid will create employment and

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},

Abstract = {This article examines the complexities of women's increasing
   participation in international development programming for gender
   equality. Taking a specific setting in rural Kyrgyzstan where one such
   project has been operating, the researchers discover adverse effects on
   the local women's livelihoods, status and health. Women's contradictions
   are attributed to the women's own failures and lacks, creating confusion
   and frustration among them. Adopting Smith's institutional-ethnography
   approach, we explicate and map out the hidden processes which must be
   held accountable for these reactionary outcomes, taking women's
   experiences as entry points to inquiry. We find that the reactionary
   effects are not accidental but organized, powerfully, systematically but
   invisibly, by taken-for-granted institutional practices serving the
   purposes of global development institutions, where women are seen as
   instruments of global economic growth. The analysis provokes critical
   discussion of `how' and `what' it takes to transform Central Asian women
   into `empowered' people.},

Abstract = {Certain researchers call to reconsider Communication for development and
   social change as a problem of ``Techniques and Society{''} (McArthur,
   Jouet, Bardini, Lohento, Kiyindou, Misse). Thus, the models of social
   integration of innovations are used here to study how the new
   development assistance modules are accepted and appropriated by their
   final users in developing countries. There is no need to prove anymore
   that users' reception and appropriation of the proposed service is
   critical to the development programs' effectiveness, be it in public
   health, environmental issues, small and medium enterprise (SME)
   development, or other. We synthesize the Anglo-Saxon and French models
   and distinguish the common determinant axes for the innovations or
   novelties reception: before their actual use (acceptance models) and
   after it (appropriation models). The common base appears to be the
   mental construction of the sense of use: the user mobilizes his
   representations ``already there{''} (anchoring in existing
   representations, Moscovici, Jodelet, LeBlanc) and his imaginary (Flichy,
   Musso) to assess the associated use benefitscosts, the
   anticipated-perceived use experience. In the literature, this mental
   construction process is theorized as the formation of the Perceived
   Value of Use (PVU) (Jouet, Mallein and Toussaint, Mallein et coll.,
   Toussaint, Boenisch, Assude et al, Nelson, Kim et al.). However, it is
   necessary to further explore this process. Eager to explore the PVU
   concept in detail, we conducted a two-phase field qualitative study
   within the SME support sector (UN Sustainable Development Goals 8.3 and
   9.3), in Turkmenistan, Central Asia. Our results suggest that we can
   model the PVU formation mechanism, and its role in the cognitive
   appropriation and acceptance of the new support services by the final
   users. We propose to test the results of our research, within the
   context of other developing countries and of other sectors.},

Abstract = {We design and apply a rando mised controlled trial that seeks to examine
   the overall impact of a nationwide training program for female
   entrepreneurs that own small or medium businesses in the tourism and
   garment sectors in the Kyrgyz Republic on outcome variables related to
   business growth and decision making. Unlike other studies, we are able
   to exploit panel data based on three rounds of post-intervention
   surveys, plus the baseline. Thus, four data rounds in total. We use an
   ANCOVA model and find small positive impacts on longer-term investments
   in labour inputs, though these investments do not translate into higher
   sales or profits.},

Abstract = {Borrowing the dominant theoretical frameworks of studies of voter
   turnout in the developed world, this paper tests the applicability of
   these frameworks to a transitional democracy in a Muslim society. Using
   logistic regression, we estimate an individual's likelihood of voting in
   Kyrgyzstan's 2005 parliamentary and presidential elections. We find that
   traditional rural networks, rather than networks of voluntary
   associations, play the central role in the mobilization of voters. In
   addition, turnout is affected by long-standing cultural cleavages based
   on religion and ethnicity, and by education, occupation, and trust in
   government. Our findings suggest that the political behavior of the
   people of the Kyrgyz Republic is supportive of democracy, in spite of
   elite-level obstacles to a successful transition. (C) 2010 Published by

Title = {Uzbek for My Heart: Language Choice and Identity Negotiation in
   Multilingual Uzbekistan},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Central Asia is distinguished by its high level of multilingualism.
   Incorporating both language portrait and ethnographic methods, this
   paper attempts to uncover how young Uzbeks negotiate their use of
   language in multilingual Uzbekistan and its connections to education,
   opportunity, identity, and group membership; furthermore, it examines
   how they construct and negotiate their identities during this process.
   Under the lens of a micro and bottom-up approach, this research
   discovers that the youth of Uzbekistan regard multilingualism as a
   semiotic source of mobility that allows them to function adequately in a
   globalized world and that Uzbek, as a mother tongue, plays an important
   role in their ethnic and cultural identification. Being an Uzbek always
   occupies the first position among their many identities at the
   intersection of tradition and modernity, as well as localization and
   globalization, highlights the relationship between the mother tongue, as
   a heritage and individual development, which can be an important life
   anchor left for younger generations as a part of their own history and
   tradition, especially now, in the historical period we are living in,
   where relationships are characterized by high mobility and
   virtualization.},

Abstract = {New regimes need to make crucial decisions about the continuity of
   public policy. The new incumbents will decide whether to continue the
   previous administration's policies or make radical changes. The choice
   between continuity and change may favour the former in the early stages.
   However, the propensity to introduce new services or means of delivery
   may increase with time. In the Central Asian experience, the pattern of
   policy development reflects in part the process of gaining independence
   and the dominant autocratic regime type. The first change of leader
   presents a significant choice between continuity and change. This
   article examines Uzbekistan, focusing on a prominent area on the policy
   agenda: higher education. It investigates how the state and universities
   have faced issues in research ethics in the humanities and social
   sciences. The article examines the pattern of adoption, adaption and
   abstention in the policy process and demonstrates the predominance of
   the last option.},

Abstract = {Manganese and gemstone (turquoise and cacholong) deposits of the central
   Kyzyl Kum region formed during the development of the sedimentary cover.
   Aggressive metal-bearing fluids were formed within the cover due to
   equilibration of sediments. Tectonic reactivation of the region resulted
   in the formation of erosion windows in the sedimentary cover and
   ascending gleyey (H2S-free) solutions were discharged within the erosion
   windows. Various geochemical barriers in near-surface zones favored the
   concentration of Mn, gemstone-forming elements, and associated
   components. Their virtually simultaneous deposition from the same
   ore-forming fluids at different geochemical barriers was responsible for
   the differentiation of mineralization in the cross section. Processes of
   recent activation migrated from the southeast to northwest with the
   successive formation and erosion of ephemeral manganese and gemstone
   deposits in the same direction. At present, only the youngest deposits
   located in the northern central Kyzyl Kum region are sufficiently well
   retained.},

Title = {Basin efficiency approach and its effect on streamflow quality,
   Zerafshan River Uzbekistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {476},
Pages = {128-135},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial-temporal patterns of water quality parameters
   and apportioning the sources of water pollution are important for water
   management. Within the Zerafshan basin a basin efficiency approach is
   practiced. Here water quality data for a 30 year period are presented
   and analysed according to spatial distribution utilising box plots and
   cluster analysis. The results show quality declines in its middle and
   lower reaches due to return flows from intensively irrigated
   agricultural region as well as a ``Hot spot{''} with organic and
   nutrient pollution due to return flows from industrial effluent and
   municipal wastewater. Comparison between upstream and downstream sites
   shows an increase of salinity and COD concentrations as well as a more
   sulphate-rich and chloride-rich composition of the downstream waters.
   The application of box plots, the Seasonal Mann-Kendall Test and the
   Mann-Kendall Trend in combination show a moderate increase in river
   water quality due to the reduction of industrial discharges after the
   collapse of the Soviet Union. However, during this period chloride has a
   strong decreasing trend which is connected to increased reuse of
   drainage and return waters. Overall the lower Zerafshan can be described
   as a collector for water pollutants causing water quality problems for
   local water supply. The outcomes support the more general debate on
   Zerafshan water quality with reliable and more detailed information and
   provide information on water quality issues for the inclusion in the
   basin efficiency discussions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Central Asian countries have, since gaining independence in 1991,
   suffered from endemic corruption as a legacy of their Soviet roots.
   There are multiple ways of tackling corruption ranging from preventative
   to control measures. One tool in this battery of measures is the use of
   codes of ethics enforced through ethics commissioners. Kazakhstan is
   attempting to take a lead role in driving public sector reforms in the
   Central Asian region but has achieved limited success in addressing the
   seemingly intractable problem of corruption. This paper offers a
   formative assessment of the impact of ethics commissioners on the
   problem. We find limited political commitment for the initiative,
   institutional weaknesses, and the absence of a problem solving approach
   by the Kazakhstani government.},

Title = {Making sense of conservative narratives in Kyrgyzstan: the case of
   illiberal public activists},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Abstract = {In recent years, we observe the growth of illiberal discourses in
   Kyrgyzstan. Illiberal public activists are particularly active in
   engaging with the Kyrgyz-speaking population and spreading conservative
   values. This paper studies the narratives of illiberal public activists
   and reveals three main trends in their speeches: promoting strong
   anti-western sentiments; combining Kyrgyz traditional values and ethnic
   identity with the religious doctrines for a bigger impact; and actively
   using digital and social media and focusing on youth and informal
   education as their main strategies in promoting illiberal thoughts. This
   paper argues that promotion of conservative ideas by the Kyrgyz-speaking
   illiberal public activists is a home-grown process, not directly
   influenced by Russian illiberal propaganda. It is a result of evolving
   re-traditionalisation, growth of religious values and anti-westernism.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY \& SPACE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {905-923},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper proceeds from a moment of impromptu `border-fixing' in the
   wake of an inter-communal conflict, to explore the everyday
   spatialisation of the state in a rural region of Central Asia. Drawing
   on ethnography from the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border, it contributes to
   a growing concern to understand how the state is rendered `integral' in
   everyday life. Rather than focusing on the enactments and justificatory
   statements of state officials, the paper explores instead the diffuse
   but passionate work of borderland dwellers in policing the state edge in
   a context of political upheaval. `Territory' in this reading is not just
   an a priori attribute of the state, nor only the product of official
   imaginings and interventions, but the site, too, of everyday practical
   and symbolic work, a vehicle for claims making and the means of
   performative enactments of belonging and difference. The paper calls for
   greater attention to the `ordinary affects' that are elicited by borders
   and boundedness and the need to bring discussions of territoriality into
   conversation with a literature on the affective lire of the state. Doing
   so, it argues, will both enrich our understanding of everyday state
   formation and give us greater purchase on the role of events in
   rupturing and reconfiguring state space.},

Title = {The Copenhagen School on tour in Kyrgyzstan: Is securitization theory
   useable outside Europe?},
Journal = {SECURITY DIALOGUE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The article argues that the theoretical framework presented by the
   Copenhagen School is currently unsuited to empirical studies outside the
   West owing to two factors. First, the presence of the `Westphalian
   straitjacket' has prevented explicit interrogation of the normative
   concepts underlying the framework: there is a presumption that European
   understandings of society and the state are universal. Second, the
   centrality of the speech-act for securitization to the exclusion of
   other forms of expression, such as physical action, results in the
   theoretical framework producing a Westernized description of a given
   situation. The extent to which these factors limit the utility of the
   concepts of securitization and societal security in a non-Western
   setting is illustrated through the case of the overthrow of the
   government in Kyrgyzstan in March 2005. This example forms an empirical
   critique to highlight how theoretical shortcomings result in a
   simplified and Westernized description of the situation that does not
   take into account the specific local socio-political context. The
   article concludes that if the Copenhagen School's theoretical framework
   is to be considered suitable for universal application, future
   theoretical developments must explicitly address the issues discussed to
   enable progress in escaping International Relations' Westphalian
   straitjacket.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Television draws attention as a very powerful means of mass
   communication taking up a very important part in social life.
   Television, when compared to other mass media, remains as a means that
   presents information to people in an effective and persuasive way
   without requiring any training for use. Television comes to the fore
   among other social media due to its audio and visual elements and its
   ability to create a false sense of participation. Television informs
   while entertaining. Especially, it presents people with various
   alternatives not only to be relieved of the oppressive everyday life but
   also to recognize a dream world and share others' experiences of life.
   The aim of this research carried out in Kyrgyzstan is to determine
   people's motivations and habits of watching television. According to the
   data obtained from 583 participants, 5 motivations have been determined
   that are effective in people's watching television. In order of
   importance, these are: entertainment-relaxation, escape from social
   interaction, companionship, information seeking and pastime. The gender
   of the participants, the number of televisions at home, the frequency of
   watching television, and motivations for watching television are the
   basic variables that determine the duration of watching television.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {137-147},

Abstract = {We combine institutional economic perspectives and actor-network theory
   to elucidate the role of contracts in the evolution of transitional
   agricultural systems. Such combination of theories can shed a light on
   the mutual constitution of actors and institutions, and the formation of
   economic strategies. We argue that forms and functions of contracts can
   only be understood in an evolutionary context. In a case study of the
   Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, where several waves of reform created two
   principal actors - commercial farms (called fermers locally) responsible
   for state-ordered production and semi-subsistence smallholders (called
   dekhqans locally) - it is demonstrated how in the self-transformation of
   the actor-network, and thus the shifts in forms and roles of contracts,
   several network features play a role: interdependencies between the
   actors, the essential actant of the irrigation and drainage system,
   formal/informal dialectics. Time horizons, risk/benefit calculations,
   trust and cooperation forms emerge in the self-reproducing network and
   leave space for certain contractual forms and functions. (C) 2013

   in two districts of Samarqand, Uzbekistan, provide a description of the
   diversity of fruits and nut trees, as well as the nature of systems for
   planting material. Econometric analysis reveals a linkage between
   participation in community groups and the levels of fruit and nut tree
   diversity managed by households. No relationship is found between the
   type of institution used to obtain genetic material and the level of
   diversity in orchards. Household participation in community groups

Abstract = {In arid environments, water shortages due to over-allocation of river
   flow are often compensated by lift irrigation or pumping groundwater. In
   such environments, farmers using pumped irrigation can deploy on-farm
   energy-efficient and water-saving technologies; however, pumping water
   requiring extra energy is associated with carbon emissions. This study
   explores how to increase crop production using pumped irrigation with
   minimal energy and carbon emissions. The purpose of this research is
   twofold: first, to examine on-farm energy consumption and carbon
   emissions in gravity and groundwater irrigation systems; and second, to
   explore system-level alternatives of power generation and water
   management for food production based on the results from the farm-level
   analysis. This study employs a novel system-level approach for
   addressing water, energy, and carbon tradeoffs under pumped irrigation
   using groundwater. These tradeoffs are assessed at farm and system
   levels. On-farm level estimates showed that farm-level interventions
   were insufficient to produce mutual gains. According to the results of
   the system-level evaluation, system-level interventions for water and
   energy conservation, the use of renewable energy to pump water for
   irrigation, and river basin scale cooperation are all required to
   maintain crop production while reducing energy consumption and carbon
   emissions.},

Abstract = {Since the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the three states of South
   Caucasus or Trans-Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia) and the
   five of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
   and Turkmenistan) have played up their role as intermediaries between
   Europe and Asia and have tried to constitute the Caspian as an entity.
   This new Trans-Caspian road obeys political and economic logics as the
   states of the South Caucasus along with those of Central Asia are
   interested in bypassing Russia and developing their bilateral relations
   to acquire new markets in Europe and in Asia. Despite the existence of
   sometimes divergent, sometimes convergent interests, and the
   non-negligible political and economic risks, none of the states of the
   South Caucasus, nor those of Central Asia, want to undermine the dynamic
   of Trans-Caspian rapprochement.},

Title = {Variation of groundwater salinity in the partially irrigated Amudarya
   River delta, Uzbekistan},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {287-295},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {The Amudarya delta region contains surface and groundwater resources
   that discharge into the shrinking Large Aral Sea and ultimately control
   its future fate. These freshwater resources are prerequisites for
   sustaining the population of the region. However, salinization and
   pollution caused by agricultural irrigation is a key problem for these
   water systems. Here, we report results from a recent field measurement
   campaign conducted during April 2005 which included 24 monitoring wells
   located in an irrigated region of the Amudarya delta, thereby extending
   the historical data set of groundwater levels and salinity measurements.
   This data set is combined with corresponding data from a downstream,
   non-irrigated region that was formerly irrigated (together covering
   16,100km(2) between the Uzbek cities of Nukus and Muynak). This
   comparison shows that in the downstream region, which is currently not
   irrigated, shallow groundwaters are far more saline (average 23g I-1)
   than the currently irrigated region (average 3g I-1). We estimate that
   the unconfined aquifer within the 13,500km(2) non-irrigated zone of
   study area contains 9billion tons of salt, or almost as much salt as the
   entire Aral Sea (containing 11 billion tons of salt and covering an area
   of 20,000km(2) in year 2000). Within the non-irrigated zone, there are
   statistically significant large-scale spatial correlations between
   groundwater salinity and distance to the Amudarya River, irrigation
   canals and surface water bodies when distance is measured along the
   modelled regional groundwater flow direction. Generally, groundwater
   salinities are lower downstream of surface water bodies in the
   non-irrigated zone, Annual fluctuations in groundwater salinity are too
   large to be explained by input from surface water (Amudarya) or
   wind-blown salt from the dried Aral Sea sediments. Salt transport by
   groundwater is the only plausible remaining explanation for these
   changes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Providing support to ``civil society{''} in the form of funding to
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) became a central aspect of
   development engagement in Kyrgyzstan and other post-socialist countries
   in the 1990s, seen as a means of ensuring `` good governance,{''}
   promoting participation, and providing a safety net of sorts to those
   who were left vulnerable by the market reforms that followed the
   collapse of Communism. Since then, donor engagement in Kyrgyzstan has
   led to the development of a thriving NGO sector, taken to embody ``civil
   society{''} and to be a sign of the country's democratization, in
   comparison to its neighbors. However, this sector is dependent on
   support from international donors, and faces increasing hostility for
   supposedly representing outside interests, rather than effectively
   addressing the needs of the Kyrgyzstani population. This is particularly
   the case in regard to work on women's rights and gender equality. Based
   on interviews with 16 self-described activists working on gender issues,
   this paper explores what it is like to ``do{''} gender activism in this
   practical and discursive environment. For my respondents, activity in
   the NGO sector emerges as not only a process that goes far beyond the
   straightforward implementation of donor agendas, but also one that does
   not necessarily ``fit{''} with dominant understandings of what
   constitutes civil society activism.},

Abstract = {This article deals with a neotraditional institution: the aksakal courts
   (courts of elders, or whitebeards) in Central Asian Kyrgyzstan. Founded
   in 1993 by the first president of the country, and based on an elaborate
   law enacted in 2002, the newly appointed aksakal judges were supposed to
   judge according to what were considered to be the customs and traditions
   of the Kyrgyz. In this article I show in what ways the judges' way of
   being aksakals often accords neither with the letter nor intent of the
   law, but reflects a more fundamental way of ordering the world, here
   referred to as customization. I argue that the ways in which the court
   members in rural and urban Kyrgyzstan link themselves to traditionalist
   imagery and state trappings reveal a more general point about how people
   in contemporary Central Asia engage with their being-in-the-world. This
   is particularly relevant in times of social change such as those
   initiated after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.},

   health campaigns in the most populous Central Asian country. In
   Uzbekistan, as in other countries of the region, significant
   international support was given to NGOs providing reproductive health

   HIV/AIDS pandemic and after the 1994 mandate of the International

   health as a key reproductive health component. Examining the exclusion
   of sexual health issues from reproductive health campaigns in Uzbekistan
   highlights problems relating to time lags in program and evaluative
   development and the difficulties NGOs experienced in balancing
   donor-state agendas with recipient-state priorities. Findings question
   standard assumptions regarding the advantageous structural aspects of

Title = {Water environmental pressure assessment in agricultural systems in
   Central Asia based on an Integrated Excess Nitrogen Load Model},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {803},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Agricultural runoff is the main source of water pollution in Central
   Asia. Excessive nitrogen (N) inputs from over-use of chemical
   fertilizers are threatening regional water resources. However, the
   scarcity of quantitative data and simplified empirical models limit the
   reliability of grey water footprint (GWF), particularly in undeveloped
   regions. In this study, we developed an Integrated Excess Nitrogen Load
   Model (IENLM) to calculate excess N load and evaluate its potential
   water environmental pressure in Central Asia. The model optimized the
   biological N fixation and atmospheric N deposition modules by involving
   more environmental variables and human activ-ities. Results showed that
   N fertilizer application contributed over 60\% to total N input and was
   mainly responsible for 42.9\% increase of total GWF from 101.5 to 145.0
   billion m(3) during 1992 -2018. Water pollution level (WPL) increased
   from 0.55 in 1992 to 2.41 in 2018 and the pollution assimilation
   capacity of water systems has been fully consumed just by N load from
   agriculture since 2005. GWF intensity and grey water pollution -
   efficiency types in all Central Asian countries have improved in recent
   years except for Turkmenistan. N fertilizer application and agricultural
   economy development were the main driving factors induced N pollution.
   Results were validated by riverine nitrate concentrations and the
   estimates from prior studies. In future, combining the N fertilizer
   reduction with other farm management practices were projected to
   effectively improve the WPL. The modeling framework is favorable for N
   pollution research in data-scarce regions and provides a scien-tific
   basis for decision-making for agriculture and water resource
   managements. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Russians in post-Soviet Central Asia: more `cold' than the others?
   Exploring (ethnic) identity under different sociopolitical settings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {This paper explores the identity and the social/political behaviour of
   Russians in post-Soviet Central Asia through a comparison with the
   Baltic countries via a `hot and cold ethnicity' paradigm. Central Asian
   Russians are more likely, ceteris paribus, to be found at the `cold' end
   of the spectrum of `ethnic temperatures'. The article starts with
   outlining the historical roots of a specific Russians' self-designation
   in the `imperial peripheries' - that is, a lowered attachment to their
   ethnic group as compared with loyalties towards the state. However,
   patterns of imperial penetration into different territories of the
   former USSR (FSU) were different, and so were the sociopolitical
   conditions under which Russians have found themselves after the collapse
   of the FSU. Due to this, patterns of Russians' self-designation turned
   out to be quite divergent: Central Asia represents a contrasting pattern
   in comparison with the Baltics. Subsequent parts of the paper contain a
   more detailed analysis of the reasons behind a relatively `cold' ethnic
   stance of Russians in Central Asia. These reasons include the salience
   of sociocultural boundaries versus ethnic ones, the nature of local
   political regimes, the role of Russian language and culture, official
   and popular interpretation of the Soviet past and attitudes towards the
   present-day Russia.},

Abstract = {Charles Callwell's Small Wars (1896, 1899, 1906) is widely considered
   both an ur-text for modern counter-insurgency studies, and a primer for

   way it is usually only considered within a British context. Alongside
   the numerous examples Callwell used from British colonial campaigns, he
   frequently referred to those of other European powers - notably the
   Russian conquest of Central Asia. This article will seek to analyse
   Callwell's views of Russian colonial warfare, establish the sources on
   which he relied, and evaluate his accuracy and the effect which the

Abstract = {In social-ecological systems, natural resource management can be
   characterized by trade-offs across sectors andsustainability targets.
   The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus concept makes explicit various
   trade-offs in order to maximize synergies ofinterventions. However,
   there are few successful examples of its operationalization in research
   settings. Here, we explore in a learningsetting if sustainability impact
   assessment (SIA) protocols can be a useful process to be used to adopt a
   systemic, interdisciplinaryperspective to operationalize WEF nexus in
   research for sustainable development. The process and method adopted of
   SIA protocol,evaluated for five exemplary WEF nexus cases in Central
   Asia during a week-long international workshop, adequately addressed
   thecomplexity of WEF interrelationships and associated sustainability
   issues, and facilitated a comparative case study analysis acrossscales.
   Results within this process highlight that water governance was critical
   for large-scale transboundary WEF nexus management,while land and soil
   management were decisive for minimizing trade-offs at local levels.
   Issues of interdisciplinarity, complexity,uncertainty, and reflection on
   impacts were adequately addressed, but challenges remain in the
   consideration of ethics and the designof transparent, multi-actor
   cooperation. Most importantly, this exercise showed that employment of
   the process of SIA protocolsupported disciplinary experts to work across
   disciplines and take a systemic approach for analyzing WEF nexus.},

Abstract = {The article develops a game theoretical model for the evolution of
   various regionalism projects. It contends that regionalism in the
   post-World War II (WWII) world has almost always evolved in the shadow
   of extraregional great powers (EGPs), with the United States being the
   principal, but not the only, EGP. As such, how regional great powers
   (RGPs) and small-to-medium states (SMSs) within a region interact with
   each other in the shadow of EGPs are critical to the evolution of
   different regionalism projects. This setup leads to a game theoretical
   framework. Among the various regionalism projects, regionalism in
   Central Asia is an intriguing case. The model developed in this article
   implies that the sometimes competitive and sometimes cooperative
   interaction among SMSs, EGPs, and RGPs can best explain the historical
   dynamics of the regionalism project in Central Asia. In particular, the
   model explains why the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the
   regionalism project that has been proclaimed to be dead or close to be
   dead by many pundits, has become the more resilient and visible among
   the many regionalism projects within the region. The model also applies
   to other regionalism projects.},

Abstract = {Cotton is a leading agricultural non-food commodity associated with soil
   degradation, water pollution and pesticide poisoning due to high levels
   of agrochemical inputs. Organic farming is often promoted as a means of
   addressing the economic, environmental and health risks of conventional
   cotton production, and it is slowly gaining ground in the global cotton
   market. Organic and fair trade cotton are widely seen as opportunities
   for smallholder farmers to improve their livelihoods thanks to higher
   returns, lower input costs and fewer risks. Despite an increasing number
   of studies comparing the profitability of organic and non-organic
   farming systems in developing and industrialized countries, little has
   been published on organic farming in Central Asia. The aim of this
   article is to describe the economic performance and perceived social and
   environmental impacts of organic cotton in southern Kyrgyzstan, drawing
   on a comparative field study conducted by the author in 2009. In
   addition to economic and environmental aspects, the study investigated
   farmers' motivations toward and assessment of conversion to organic
   farming. Cotton yields on organic farms were found to be 10\% lower,
   while input costs per unit were 42\% lower; as a result, organic
   farmers' cotton revenues were 20\% higher. Due to lower input costs as
   well as organic and fair trade price premiums, the average gross margin
   from organic cotton was 27\% higher. In addition to direct economic
   benefits, organic farmers enjoy other benefits, such as easy access to
   credit on favorable terms, provision of uncontaminated cottonseed
   cooking oil and cottonseed cake as animal feed, and marketing support as
   well as extension and training services provided by newly established
   organic service providers. The majority of organic farmers perceive
   improved soil quality, improved health conditions, and positively assess
   their initial decision to convert to organic farming. The major
   disadvantage of organic farming is the high manual labor input required.
   In the study area, where manual farm work is mainly women's work and
   male labor migration is widespread, women are most affected by this
   negative aspect of organic farming. Altogether, the results suggest
   that, despite the inconvenience of a higher workload, the advantages of
   organic farming outweigh its disadvantages and that conversion to
   organic farming improves the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.},

Title = {Optimizing water resources allocation and soil salinity control for
   supporting agricultural and environmental sustainable development in
   Central Asia},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {704},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {In this study, a stochastic-fuzzy-based fractional programming (SFFP)
   method is advanced for optimizing water-resources allocation and
   soil-salinity control under uncertainty. The developed method can
   address ratio objective optimization problems of complex system in
   association with stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties, which can help gain
   in-depth analysis of the interrelationships between marginal
   effectiveness and system reliability. Then, SFFP is applied to an
   irrigation region in the lower reach of Amu Darya River basin, where
   linear crop yield-salinity functions and salt-leaching functions are
   introduced into the modeling formulation for reflecting the complicated
   interactions among water resources, soil salinity, arable land, and
   electricity supply. Solutions under 96 scenarios related to different
   irrigation efficiencies, water availabilities, and electricity supplies
   have been obtained. Our findings are: i) increased water availability,
   electricity supply, and irrigation efficiency result in high marginal
   benefit; ii) irrigation efficiency is the key factor influencing water
   allocation patterns for crop irrigation and salt-leaching, promotion of
   which can facilitate mitigating economic and environmental losses in the
   water-deficit and soil-salinized region; iii) leaching water allocation
   patterns for soil-salinity washing is related to salinity characters of
   crops and regions, and boosting drought- and salt-tolerance crop can be
   effective in adaption to risks of water scarcity and land salinization.
   Compared to the conventional approaches, SFFP can generate more flexible
   alternatives and achieve higher marginal effectiveness. These findings
   can provide effective decision support to identify desired water
   management strategies under multiple uncertainties for supporting
   agricultural sustainability in arid regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Purpose Although East Asia and South East Asia have seen growth in
   mobile commerce activities, the uptake of such activities in Central
   Asia has been relatively low. For insight, the purpose of this paper is
   to investigate the impact of culture, innovation characteristics and
   concerns about order fulfillment on mobile commerce (shopping) intention
   in Central Asia. Design/methodology/approach In total, 779
   questionnaires were collected (via mall-intercept method) from cities in
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The data were then subjected to
   two-step structural equation modeling procedures (using SPSS AMOS V.25)
   for hypothesis testing. Findings This study revealed that innovation
   characteristics, system-based trust (trust in mobile technology), and
   concerns about order fulfillment affected mobile commerce intention in
   Central Asia. The strong uncertainty avoidance characteristics of
   societies in the region mean potential adoptee place great emphasis on
   trialability and security of mobile commerce. Uncertainty avoidance
   correlated strongly with concerns about order fulfillment, thereby
   significantly impacting mobile commerce intention. Power distance and
   collectivism correlated with observability as factors affecting mobile
   commerce intention. The innovation characteristics of compatibility,
   complexity and relative advantage directly impact mobile commerce
   intention in Central Asia. Research limitations/implications - There are
   several limitations in this paper. First, the data in this study are
   limited to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. This might affect the
   generalization of this study's findings across the whole Central Asia
   region. Second, the respondents in this study are exposed to mobile
   shopping for less than 30 min before been asked to complete the survey.
   This might affect respondent's confidence in mobile commerce. Future
   study might involve the rest of Central Asia (Tajikistan, Afghanistan
   and Turkmenistan). Future study might also want to investigate the
   impact of Web assurance seal on mobile commerce intention in Central
   Asia. Practical implications - Managerial/marketing implications and
   recommended strategies in this study would be useful for businesses
   (aspirant e-vendors) in Central Asia. Originality/value There is limited
   study about mobile commerce in Central Asia. Furthermore, extant
   literature on mobile commerce in the region lacked age varieties or
   lacked multi-national and logistical perspective. This is important
   given the wide geographical spread of the region. This study addressed
   these gaps by collecting data from all segments of society in
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to test propositions regarding
   innovation characteristics, culture, and concerns about order
   fulfillment as factors impacting mobile commerce intention in Central
   Asia.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comparative analysis of the strategies employed
   over the last decade by governments of five Central Asia
   republics-Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and
   Uzbekistan-to raise educational quality at the primary and secondary
   levels. Data are drawn from a 2002 cross-national study sponsored by the
   Asian Development Bank that examined recent education reform efforts
   across these countries. Using a globalization perspective, a comparison
   of countries on 14 strategies that were most commonly used by these
   countries suggested that efforts to raise education quality met with
   mixed results. While raising the quality of education was a popular
   cause and a safe political goal, it proved to be an elusive target. (c)

Abstract = {Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is an effective approach to
   relief water resources shortages and its uneven temporal and spatial
   distribution in arid inland regions of central Asia. In this paper, 16
   characteristic factors of water resources and related systems which are
   sensitive to different types of conjunctive use were selected in order
   to develop an index system for evaluation impact of conjunctive use,
   based on the fundamental types of water resources conjunctive use in
   inland basins. In an attempt to address the issue of spring drought and
   summer floods in Tailan River Basin in Xinjiang, three scenarios of
   conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, well-canal
   combination, piedmont reservoirs and groundwater reservoirs were
   investigated. The utilization of water resources and the response of its
   related systems were evaluated and analyzed quantitatively using the
   groundwater numerical simulation model (Visual MODFLOW). Furthermore,
   the impacts of conjunctive use were assessed using the method of
   multi-level fuzzy comprehensive assessment. The results show that the
   scheme of combination of Laolongkou piedmont reservoir
   regulation-groundwater development, is the best in terms of the
   evaluation of water conjunctive use effects, followed by the well-canal
   combination. The comprehensive effect of well-canal combination along
   with groundwater reservoir wouldn't be better than the former both.},

   the transparency of operations of Central Asia's power utilities,
   beginning with the transactions between subsidiaries; and (ii) improving
   incentives for distribution companies to perform their billing and cash
   collection responsibilities, both through improved accountability, and,
   in the countries studied, some privatisation of these commercial
   services. They also highlight the critical role of governmental
   commitment to restoring discipline, the importance of setting limited

Journal = {ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Objective: The main objective of the article is to confirm the
   relationship between the innovativeness of new ventures and exporting.
   Based on the Oslo Manual, which indicates four main types of innovation,
   we analysed the innovation processes in firms and the impact of
   particular categories of innovation on export odds.
   Research Design \& Methods: Apart from the literature review and its
   criticism, the article is based on data collected by the BEEPS,
   conducted among enterprises located in post-communist countries in
   Eastern Europe and Central Asia. After an appropriate selection
   procedure, 906 ventures were finally picked. For this purpose, five
   logit models were created to determine the chances for export, depending
   on the type of innovation implemented in each enterprise.
   Findings: The likelihood of export in ventures is higher when it
   implements process and organisational innovations. Research results show
   that the implementation of organisational innovations by ventures
   increases the likelihood of export more than twice, while in the case of
   process innovations - about one and a half times.
   Implications \& Recommendations: he importance of process and
   organisational innovations in ventures seems to play an important role
   in explaining the odds of their export. We recommend that future studies
   focus on explaining the lack of impact of product innovations and the
   negative relation of marketing innovations on the export propensity of
   ventures.
   Contribution \& Value Added: The article enriches the ongoing scientific
   discourse on the role of innovation in determining the export odds of
   ventures.},

Title = {Sustainability-Related Implications of Competitive Advantages in
   Agricultural Value Chains: Evidence from Central Asia-China Trade and
   Investment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {More stable value chains in agriculture allow countries to take the best
   advantage of their factor endowments and thus achieve the UN Sustainable
   Development Goal on ending hunger. It is, however, difficult to
   interpret such advantages properly due to the multivariate effects of
   natural, technological, and economic variables on agricultural output
   and food supply. The authors attempt to tackle this challenge by
   developing the approach to the identification of competitive advantages
   and matching them with the production capabilities of agricultural
   sectors in Central Asia. The application of Revealed Comparative
   Advantage (RCA), Relative Trade Advantage (RTA), Lafay Competitive
   Advantage (LI), and Domestic Resource Costs (DRC) indexes to the array
   of 37 products results in the revealing of comparative, trade,
   competitive, and production advantages of five Central Asian economies
   for labor-intensive horticultural products and grains. Capital and
   technology-intensive sectors of animal husbandry and food processing are
   recognized as low competitive. Taking Central Asia-China collaboration
   as a model, the authors elaborate policy measures aimed at support,
   promotion, or establishment of competitive advantages. The application
   of the measures facilitates the concentration of the resources toward
   competitive and conditionally competitive products, allows to protect
   fragile advantages in marginally competitive sectors, and contributes to
   the overall improvement of stakeholders' performance across agricultural
   value chains in the region.},

Abstract = {The former Soviet Central Asian republic of Tajikistan has witnessed a
   conflictual political and social transformation after 1991 leading to a
   devastating civil war between 1992 and 1997. After the civil war,
   international efforts of liberal peacebuilding and post-conflict
   rehabilitation allowed a domestic detente, in which political and,
   importantly, religious pluralism could flourish unprecedently for the
   standards of the country. Still, this form of pluralism did not meet the
   ideal standards of covenantal pluralism as such. In the past decade,
   moreover, Tajikistan has gradually turned into a consolidated autocracy
   in which even formal pluralism is suspended. Authoritarian governance,
   especially in the sphere of religion, has aggravated societal divides
   and undermined social cohesion in the country. Although the short-term
   prospects for pluralism in general and covenantal pluralism in
   particular are dim, a differentiated perspective on the ideal of
   covenantal pluralism in the longue duree might provide possible starting
   points for meaningful engagement in Tajikistan bridging religious,
   societal, and political divides.},

Abstract = {Uzbekistan's first law targeting violence against women (2019) appears

   on the part of non-state actors, such as activists, survivors and
   volunteer organizers. This article draws on fieldwork, interviews and
   content analysis to offer examples of these continuing grassroots
   struggles. We situate, discuss and analyse three prevalent strategies of
   `exit' and `voice' - protest in the act of self-immolation, seeking out
   shelter and participation in consciousness-raising - that are variously
   employed by women in contemporary Uzbekistan to combat their experiences
   with domestic and gender violence. We frame these cases in the context
   of the past politicization(s) of women's bodies and read them as portals
   to two examples of collective self-organizing in Samarkand, Uzbekistan -
   an old grassroots women's shelter and a new digital counterpublic -
   calling attention to the complicated role played by privileged actors
   that shield such parallel and collectivized initiatives from
   encroachments by the state.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper presents the development and transformations of Bukharan
   Jewish newspapers and periodicals (1910-38) and situates them in the
   broader Central Asian mediascape. Over a period of 30 years, the
   Bukharan Jewish press was transformed from a pioneering privately owned
   enterprise that served the needs of the Jewish communities throughout
   Central Asia to one owned and regulated by the Soviet state, serving as
   a tool to transmit propaganda and to shape and educate a predefined
   `national minority group'. The paper argues that the introduction of a
   Bukharan Jewish press in 1910 was intended to create a modernized
   language and ethnic awareness among the Jews of Central Asia. In the
   1930s, Bukharan Jewish newspapers and journals were radically Sovietized
   and finally shut down by the state. From then until the collapse of the
   Soviet Union, no Bukharan Jewish publications appeared in the bloc and
   the existence of a distinct Central Asian Jewish identity was largely
   ignored. This case study sheds light on Tsarist and Soviet minorities'
   policies and helps us to better understand the various changes
   experienced and the cultural adaptations made by many `minorities' of
   Central Asia in the Age of Colonialism.},

Journal = {POLITY},

Volume = {52},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Central Asian countries (CACs) have received
   increasing attention from international research and political
   communities. After gaining independence in 1991, the CACs went through
   diverse processes of political and economic transformations. However,
   the political and economic evolutions of these countries diverged
   substantially from what the Western community expected, especially in
   terms of regional economic cooperation. This article contends that the
   Central Asian countries have never been part of the currently
   decomposing system of liberal hegemony. Instead, they have followed
   divergent paths of transition, which have hindered regional and
   international cooperation. Additionally, during recent years, the region
   has become a complex arena in which national goals coexist with the
   interests of the major regional powers, Russia and China. Therefore, the
   evolution of the Central Asian countries over the last decades provides
   an example of the varied and complex nature of regionalism in a
   post-liberal world. This article uses an international political economy
   approach to address the complex interaction between the economic and

Abstract = {Many post-communist countries continue to search for their preferred
   genus of capitalism. During this process the Post-Socialist
   Developmental State (PSDS) became the dominant model of institutional
   arrangements and state policy in post-socialist East Asia. Upon
   embarking on a systemic transformation from socialism to capitalism,
   states such as China and Vietnam chose not to build a liberal model
   based on a free market and democracy. Instead, they chose to replicate
   the success stories of East Asia based on the historic concept of the
   developmental state. In their quest to build a post-communist
   capitalism, former Soviet republics of Central Asia, namely, Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have also tried, to
   a varying degree, to instal their own version of PSDS, as they have
   maintained an authoritarian political system and despite the initial
   efforts at accelerating economic transformation, have maintained a
   gradual and incremental pace of reforms. In compliance with PSDS
   provisions, they have relied on state intervention and industrial
   policies and after post-socialist recession characteristic of many
   countries in transition, have finally managed to achieve an impressive
   developmental dynamics, almost commensurate with that of East Asian
   post-socialist developmental states.},

Title = {Legal challenges to the management of transboundary watercourses in
   Central Asia under the conditions of Eurasian Economic Integration},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Worldwide experience has shown that interstate economic integration can
   help states in strengthening of management of transboundary waters and
   international water law serves as a reference for developing of relevant
   interstate cooperation. Transboundary waters in Central Asia play
   important role in the economic cooperation among riparian states,
   including those who are members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
   At the current stage of transboundary waters management in Central Asia,
   the obsolete legal status is evident. The international water law
   sources developed under the United Nations' auspices have no binding
   application due to luck of formal membership of the EAEU states in these
   treaties. Also the regional set of regulations, especially for the Aral
   Sea Basin, needs further enhancement and more efficient implementation.
   The bilateral interstate regulatory framework of the managemennt of
   waters shared by EAEU states in Central Asia requires development of
   additional rules to enable better accommodation of challenges existing
   in terms of the current interstate cooperation. Having said that can one
   further assume that EAEU could serve as a new legal framework for more
   effective cooperation on transboundary watercourses in Central Asia? The
   answer might be yes, but. the current stage of the legal framework for
   cooperation on transboundary waters within the EAEU requires sufficient
   enhancements in terms of developing its legal and institutional
   framework. The first condition for EAEU to serve as framework for
   cooperation on transboundary waters of Central Asia is to strengthen the
   regulatory framework for the cooperation of EAEU member states regarding
   environmental issues in general and transboundary water relations in
   particular, able to accommodate two main goals: environmental protection
   on the one hand and economic development on the other hand. The EAEU
   legal framework shall also lead to improvement of existing institutional
   cooperation and a dispute settlement mechanism on transboundary waters
   shared by the member states of the EAEU.},

   strongly affects regime preferences for various types of democracy and

   challenge standard measurements of democratic support among Muslims and

Abstract = {Clarke, George R.G., Cull, Robert, and Kisunko, Gregory-External finance
   and firm survival in the aftermath of the crisis: Evidence from Eastern
   Europe and Central Asia
   We use two data sets to study how country and firm characteristics
   affected firms' financial constraints and their likelihood of survival
   during the early phase of the recent global financial crisis in Eastern
   Europe and Central Asia (ECA), a region that was especially hard hit.
   The first data source provides information on the reported severity of
   financial constraints for 360 firms from 23 countries in 2002, 2005, and
   2008. By following the same firms over time, we are able to summarize
   the gradual easing of financial constraints from 2002 to 2005 and their
   tightening during the crisis. Key findings are that financial
   constraints during the crisis were less severe in countries with
   well-established foreign banks (i.e. entered prior to year 2000), and
   that changes in the severity of financial constraints were more
   pronounced for large firms than others during the crisis (though large
   firms continued to have less severe constraints on average). The second
   data source provides information on whether firms remained in operation
   in 2009 in six ECA countries. Controlling for other relevant
   characteristics, firms were more likely to survive the crisis if they
   had access to external credit. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (3)

Abstract = {This study examines participation constraints faced by developing
   countries and the impact of wealth and power (the power hypothesis) or
   economic and legal capacity (the capacity hypothesis) of a Member State
   on its decision to file a legal complaint against a specific other
   member at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Empirical research of 486
   WTO disputes filed between 1995 and 2014 indicates that legal capacity
   matters more than power considerations in the WTO members' legal dispute
   settlements. This study is based on the premise that Kazakhstan does
   best when using the WTO dispute settlement system (after its accession
   to the WTO) against its main trading partners. Moreover, it attempts to
   predict the maximum gross domestic product (GDP) levels of Kazakhstan's
   potential defendants. The main findings are that under the legal
   capacity theory, Kazakhstan's economic features (such as GDP per capita,
   international trade position, government efficiency, military and
   non-military government spending, and others) are sufficient to proceed
   with legal claims against the Netherlands, Austria, Romania, Portugal,

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-231},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The purpose of this exploratory research study is to provide an
   understanding of how French managers perceive major characteristics of
   Kazakhstani and Russian management cultures. Based on literature review
   about culture, the paper uses the cultural dimensions developed by such
   researchers as Adler, Hall, Hofstede, Schein, Trompenaars, etc., and
   summarized by Schneider and Barsoux (1997). A qualitative research
   method - an adaptation of the critical incident technique developed by
   Flanagan (1954) - is used to explain the peculiarities of Kazakhstani
   and Russian management culture that create problems for the French
   managers interviewed (fifteen in Kazakhstan and twelve in Russia).
   The results indicate that French managers find many common points in the
   management cultures of Kazakhstan and Russia: both cultures are
   perceived as cultures with a higher power distance and as more
   particularistic cultures where a social orientation prevails over a task
   orientation. Other common points concern human nature, time and truth
   and reality dimensions.
   However, there are important differences noted by French managers.
   Kazakhstani management culture is perceived by them as about being
   rather than doing and a more collectivist culture, with an orientation
   towards higher uncertainty avoidance. In the case of Russia, the most
   importance difference is about hierarchy and affectivity dimensions.},

Title = {Analysis of the Water Demand-Supply Gap and Scarcity Index in Lower Amu
   Darya River Basin, Central Asia},

Abstract = {Lower reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin (LADB) is one of the typical
   regions which is facing the problem of water shortage in Central Asia.
   During the past decades, water resources demand far exceeds that
   supplied by the mainstream of the Amu Darya River, and has resulted in a
   continuous decrease in the amount of water flowing into the Aral Sea.
   Clarifying the dynamic relationship between the water supply and demand
   is important for the optimal allocation and sustainable management of
   regional water resources. In this study, the relationship and its
   variations between the water supply and demand in the LADB from the
   1970s to 2010s were analyzed by detailed calculation of multi-users
   water demand and multi-sources water supply, and the water scarcity
   indices were used for evaluating the status of water resources
   utilization. The results indicated that (1) during the past 50 years,
   the average total water supply (TWS) was 271.88 x 10(8) m(3)/y, and the
   average total water demand (TWD) was 467.85 x 10(8) m(3)/y; both the
   volume of water supply and demand was decreased in the LADB, with rates
   of -1.87 x 10(8) m(3)/y and -15.59 x 10(8) m(3)/y. (2) percentages of
   the rainfall in TWS were increased due to the decrease of inflow from
   the Amu Darya River; percentage of agriculture water demand was
   increased obviously, from 11.04\% in the 1970s to 44.34\% in 2010s, and
   the water demand from ecological sector reduced because of the Aral Sea
   shrinking. (3) the supply and demand of water resources of the LADB were
   generally in an unbalanced state, and water demand exceeded water supply
   except in the 2010s; the water scarcity index decreased from 2.69 to
   0.94, indicating the status changed from awful to serious water
   scarcity. A vulnerable balanced state has been reached in the region,
   and that water shortages remain serious in the future, which requires
   special attention to the decision-makers of the authority.},

Title = {Triple vectorial analysis of financial development impact on economic
   growth: evidence from the Middle East and Central Asia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the financial
   development in the Middle East and Central Asia (MECA) and examines its
   impact on its economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The authors
   use a Panel Data Regression Analysis on a sample of 21 countries in MECA
   for the period 2008-2018. Findings Using the financial development
   indices and subindices retrieved from IMF, the study finds that the
   whole region has a below average index compared to other developing
   regions. However, this hides a great deal of variation across MECA
   countries. Surprisingly, financial development does not necessarily
   contribute to economic growth. It seems that some developing countries
   are still not predisposed to benefit from financial development due to
   several obstacles. Practical implications The authors recommend
   policymakers and regulators in MECA to promote financial stability and
   keep inflation in check so that economic agents can reap the fruits of
   financial development and foster economic growth. Policymakers should
   also stimulate competition in the financial sector, build skillful human
   capital, attract foreign direct investments, strengthen supervision and
   forensic audit and more importantly reinforce the independence of
   central banks. Originality/value The authors mitigate the shortcomings
   of single indicators as proxies for financial development by using the
   IMF Financial Development index that captures the depth, access and
   efficiency of both financial institutions and financial markets. The
   authors employ lower-middle-, upper-middle and high-income country
   groups to test the magnitude of income level on the relationship between
   financial development and economic growth.},

Abstract = {Purpose Uzbekistan is one of the most prominent cotton producers since
   the soviet era, but it has struggled to establish a complete value
   chain. The country's strategic location and industrial potential have
   not been harnessed accordingly. This paper aims to critically
   investigate the barriers in the value chain and propose solutions to the
   stakeholders in the sector. Design/methodology/approach The research
   involves both primary and secondary research methods. Value chain
   analysis method has been implemented to ground the theories and results.
   A systematic literature review was conducted to understand the current
   position in the world market. Official statistical data was collected
   from the government bodies to support the reflections of academic
   literature. Primary data was collected by conducting in-depth
   semi-structured interviews and questionnaires in 50 local textile
   companies. Finally, the authors have used their empirical evidences from
   emerging economies to provide solutions to the sector. Findings The
   value chain suffers a disconnect, as the emphasis has been on exporting
   cotton. Moreover, companies have a very limited technical know-how of
   supply chain management and hence no value addition to the raw material.
   The consumer relies on imports, as there is no significant participation
   from the Uzbek companies across the fashion segments. This is a major
   loss of earnings to the country. Originality/value Existing academic
   literature revolves around the cotton and silk industry, but, to the
   best of the authors' knowledge, there is no study that unites the value
   chain and provides solutions to its stakeholders. This paper provides a
   socio-economic vision to the stakeholders, academia and industry so that
   the country can harness its potential and become one of the leading
   apparel producing nations in the future.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Scholars of International Relations have called for the creation of a
   post-Western IR that reflects the global and local contexts of the
   declining power and legitimacy of the West. Recognising this discourse
   as indicative of the postcolonial condition, we deploy Homi Bhabha's
   concept of mimicry and James C. Scott's notion of metis to assess
   whether international political dynamics of a hybrid kind are emerging.
   Based on interviews with Central Asian political, economic, and cultural
   elites, we explore the emergence of a new global politics of a
   post-Western type. We find that Russia substantively mimics the West as
   a post-Western power and that there are some suggestive examples of the
   role of metis in its foreign policy. Among Central Asian states, the
   picture is more equivocal. Formal mimicry and metis of a basic kind are
   observable, but these nascent forms suggest that the dialectical
   struggle between colonial clientelism and anti-colonial nationalism
   remains in its early stages. In this context, a post-Western
   international politics is emerging with a postcolonial aspect but
   without the emergence of the substantive mimicry and hybrid spaces
   characteristic of established postcolonial relations.},

Abstract = {Currently, for the development of society and economic growth, new
   technologies built on new ideas and new knowledge play an important
   role. It should be noted that the potential of existing industries,
   despite the task of transferring the economy to an innovative
   development path, currently requires substantial growth in all areas:
   strategic, managerial, organizational, technical and technological,
   personnel. Analysis of the current situation by various indicators
   showed the inertia of the innovative development of enterprises in
   Kazakhstan. The purpose of the study is to conduct a review of the
   scientific literature and the development of approaches to increase the
   innovative activity of enterprises. The results of the study show that
   one of the factors for increasing the innovation susceptibility and
   absorption capacity of enterprises, leading to the growth of innovative
   activity, is the network interaction of enterprises. Channels of network
   interaction were analyzed and were proposed the expansion of network
   interaction of enterprises through the development of an informal
   information channel and human resources channel to increase the
   absorption capacity of low and medium technological enterprises, and
   expansion of interaction with universities and scientific organizations
   through the development of a channel of research projects and consulting
   to support the development of high-tech enterprises. It is assumed that
   the development of network interaction will enhance the absorption
   potential of enterprises, and, accordingly, their susceptibility to
   innovative solutions and technologies.},

Abstract = {An American geographer examines the return migration of ethnic Kazakhs
   from Mongolia to their ancestral homeland of Kazakhstan, and the
   adjustment problems confronting them upon return. This specific example
   of ``diasporic return migration{''} is emblematic of a process affecting
   nearly every state within the former USSR, and is especially acute in
   Central Asia. The study, based on the author's interviews, explores
   obstacles to the integration of Mongolian-Kazakhs into Kazakhstani
   society, and raises the question of whether this process might best be
   conceptualized as ``repatriation{''} or ``patriation{''}.},

Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Resource-rich states throughout the developing world are prone to
   rent-seeking, excessive borrowing, wasteful spending, and unbalanced
   growth as well as states with weak institutions and authoritarian
   regimes. Are the five energy-rich Soviet successor states necessarily
   doomed to repeat this experience, often referred to as the ``resource
   curse{''}? This paper advances and tests the hypothesis that Russia and
   Kazakhstan are more likely to avoid the ``resource curse{''} than
   Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan because they privatized their
   energy sectors. Specifically, we find that privatization offers a
   potential path out of the ``resource curse{''} when it involves a
   transfer of ownership to domestic actors. Although Kazakhstan initially
   appeared to be developing a viable tax regime in response to foreign
   investors, over the long term Kazakhstan's tax regime has become
   increasingly volatile and dependent upon these foreign investors. In
   contrast, domestic oil companies are helping to foster the development
   of an increasingly viable tax regime in Russia. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Several post-Soviet states have introduced indigenization policies to
   improve the relative economic, political or social position of formerly
   disadvantaged populations. Using one example of such policies -
   ``Kazakhization{''} in Kazakhstan - we investigate their impact on the
   comparative earnings of two directly affected groups, ethnic Kazakhs and
   ethnic Russians. Oaxaca decompositions show that Kazakhs are better
   endowed with income generating characteristics but receive lower returns
   to these characteristics than Russians. The second effect dominates and
   Kazakhs have comparatively lower average living standards. While
   ``Kazakhization{''} may have been successful in some sense it appears to
   also have induced ethnic Russians to move into jobs that (at least in
   monetary terms) are superior now to those held by Kazakhs. Journal of

Pages = {1395-1414},
Abstract = {This essay examines the development of one regional blogosphere, the
   Central Asian `Stanosphere', through a focus on the neweurasia blog
   project. The neweurasia project began in 2005 as an English-language
   volunteer-run blog project about the former Soviet republics of Central
   Asia and the Caucasus, rapidly becoming one of the most visited blogs
   about the region. Following this auspicious start, over the next five
   years neweurasia developed into a multi-language locally driven project
   with more than 80,000 unique page views on average per month. Despite
   its indisputable successes, the project was often a steep learning curve
   for all involved. In this essay, we examine neweurasia's evolution from
   `blogging Central Asia' towards a citizen media project, and reflect on
   some of the issues and challenges encountered. On the basis of our
   discussion, we reflect upon how neweurasia, and citizen media in
   general, can maximise its impact on the nascent Stanosphere, in the
   process helping to give Central Asia a voice in the global blogosphere.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {192-213},

Abstract = {How people view their social groups' history has important implications
   at both the collective and the individual levels. It has been
   established that collective memories, the representations of one's
   groups' history, differ between generations and individuals. Yet, it
   remains unclear how collective memories change in reaction to dramatic
   social change. Using temporal collective relative deprivation (TCRD),
   which reflects how individuals perceive their group's situation in
   history, we hypothesize that TCRD trajectories change over time and that
   highly identified individuals will be less likely to change their
   trajectory. Kyrgyz nationals (N = 166) responded immediately after the
   Tulip Revolution and one year later to TCRD measurements. Dual
   group-based trajectory analysis indicates that a third of the sample
   modified their memories about their group's situation one year after a
   dramatic social change and that low identification with the group
   predicted this change. These results support the idea that collective
   memory is revised at the individual level after dramatic social change.},

Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {329-345},

Abstract = {Tradition has come to play an important role throughout Central Asia in
   a number of new ways since independence, but has been predominantly
   investigated regarding nation building. In this article, we show how
   tradition is being used operationally in the context of activism and
   political conflict. We expose the various motivations and tactics
   pursued by aksakals (lit., whitebeards) and by a movement of mature
   women called OBON (lit., Women Units for Special Purposes) as they
   participate in politics, and the role tradition plays in these
   activities. We argue that aksakals actively draw on tradition even in
   the political realm to avoid being derogatorily labelled elders on
   duty', whereas OBON women position themselves as economic and political
   actors but are subjected to discourses and practices of tradition by
   others. While both aksakals and OBON women have been central to
   political action in Kyrgyzstan in the last two decades, this article is
   the first to compare and contrast these two categories of unusual
   activists. The comparison reveals a perpetuation of culturally
   recognized gender roles even when these actors go beyond their
   traditional' realms of competence.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {447-467},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article focuses on sociological and ethical aspects of professional
   practices in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan and offers three competing
   conceptual approaches to Soviet and post-Soviet professionalism: the
   moral consensus, the social control and the moral sentiments approaches.
   This article aims to contribute to the debate on how professional
   relationships are socially constructed, paying particular attention to
   their ethical content. We argue that the sociology of professions needs
   to engage with moral philosophy since moral reflexivity helps
   professionals to shape their responsibility to others. Were this not so,
   we would not care to judge others' actions, question their intentions or
   reason on how to live. Furthermore, as vulnerable and dependent human
   beings, we care for and have responsibilities to others. We suggest that
   the moral sentiments approach captures the tensions and conflicts of
   post-Soviet Kyrgyzstani professions, highlighting the importance of
   positive emotions and organizational capabilities to undertake good
   practices. This perspective argues that human beings are reflexive
   beings who are motivated by ultimate concerns and goals, pursue life
   projects, make commitments and act purposefully. The article shows how
   post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan professions operate in difficult political and
   economic conditions, and how far professionals possess positive
   sentiments for effective and good actions.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2479-2495},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study introduces a culturally adapted 17-item scale of school
   engagement. It offers an important contribution to the international
   literature by seeking to measure the school engagement of young people
   in a society undergoing transition from a collectivist to individualist
   mind-set alongside an education system focused on improving performance
   in international benchmarks such as those from the Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD Programme for International
   Student Assessment, PISA) and the International Association for the
   Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA Trends In International
   Mathematics And Science Study, TIMSS). To date, little has been written
   on how intra-individual and inter-individual factors contribute to young
   people's engagement in education as societal and systemic educational
   reform occurs. The school engagement scale is validated by testing the
   empirical fit of a second-order multidimensional factor model of school
   engagement taken from the Western literature to large-scale data in
   Kazakhstan. Culturally relevant features are added such as the strong
   influence of `important others'. The model tested was formed from 1) an
   individual's cognitions and behaviours associated with school and 2) the
   social influences of parents, peers, and teachers. 1767 secondary
   education students in Kazakhstan participated in the study. Confirmatory
   analyses supported the hypothesized additional contributory factors to
   school engagement. Use of the overall model indicated differences in
   means across gender, grade, school-type, and geographic location to
   show: (1) higher cognitive engagement for young women; (2) rural
   students with higher levels of behavioural engagement; and (3)
   substantial differences in social support by grade and rurality.},

Abstract = {Small towns' structure, typology, functionality, development prospects
   studies occupy leading positions in the world community. Regional
   displacement system significance in new economic conditions, industrial
   potential formation processes in the organizational-economic management
   structure at local level specify this position. The need to develop
   innovative management models for towns' development led to search for
   new analytical methods of the situation. These methods consider budget
   supportability, related to the most important territorial socio-economic
   development indicators. However the most important conditions capable to
   solve towns' socioeconomic problems should include transformations in
   intergovernmental relations considering territorial development
   features. For SKR, as territorial integrity, it is necessary to identify
   and specify local and regional market needs. The analysis was carried
   out from towns' socio-economic development position, considering their
   territorial economic-geographical features. Based on these positions,
   the methodology of the study in the article was constructed.
   Particularly, regional towns' development prospects were identified.
   Attention was focused on towns' problems from the local economic
   mainstay position. The further local self-government system formation
   led to revision of towns' strategic orientations, led to search for ways
   to increase their potential. Regional towns' socio-economic development
   problems solution was constrained by several factors, such as inadequacy
   in the study degree of town's economic potential structure formation,
   and possibilities for its further development. The article assessesSKO
   cities and districts social-economic sphere development level. Such
   areas as education, medicine, culture, sports were accepted as basic
   indicators for analysis. The analysis revealed that weak
   industrial-agricultural diversification and underdeveloped
   infrastructure are characteristic for these districts. The influence has
   the fact that many settlements are significantly remote from the main
   transport highways. Based on the data obtained, SKO territorial units'
   typology was developed according to the resettlement type. Based on
   needs and available capacity, this typology can further provide
   opportunity develop effective development strategy for these areas.},

Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {71-79},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Our research investigates the impact of a major resource boom on income
   inequality within Kazakhstan's regions using household-level data across
   the entire income distribution and within the top and bottom halves of
   the income distribution. In addition, we evaluate the inequality
   dynamics separately in urban and rural areas. The theoretical foundation
   shows that a resource boom will decrease income inequality through the
   labor market if the non-traded sector is relatively intensive in its use
   of unskilled labor. Government transfers financed by resource income can
   further reduce inequality. Our regression analysis indicates that
   resource booms lower inequality when we control for the effect of
   changing labor income, institutional quality, education levels, and
   public health care spending. In addition, quality of institutions is an
   important equalizing factor for the lower income households in urban
   areas, but not in rural areas. Public health programs decrease overall
   inequality in the rural areas; however, they do not affect the bottom
   half of the income distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The psychology of mineral wealth: Empirical evidence from Kazakhstan},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite rapidly-expanding academic and policy interest in the links
   between natural resource wealth and development failures - commonly
   referred to as the `resource curse' - little attention has been devoted
   to the psychology behind the phenomenon. Rent-seeking and excessive
   reliance on mineral revenues can be attributed largely to social
   psychology. Mineral booms (whether due to the discovery of mineral
   reserves or to the drastic rise in commodity prices) start as positive
   income shocks that can subsequently evolve into influential and
   expectation-changing public and media narratives; these lead
   consecutively to unrealistic demands that favor immediate consumption of
   accrued mineral revenues and to the postponement of productive
   investment. To our knowledge, this paper is the first empirical analysis
   that tests hypotheses regarding the psychological underpinnings of
   resource mismanagement in mineral-rich states. Our study relies on an
   extensive personal survey (of 1977 respondents) carried out in Almaty,
   Kazakhstan, between May and August 2018. We find empirical support for a
   positive link between exposure to news and inflated expectations
   regarding mineral availability, as well as evidence that the latter can
   generate preferences for excessive consumption, and hence, rent-seeking.},

   irrigated agriculture. From AD 1000 onwards, extensive series of
   engineered canals were constructed, producing a rich agricultural
   society in a region formerly considered to be dominated by nomadic

Journal = {SOCIETY \& ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-80},
Abstract = {The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is commonly seen in the cultural
   landscape within the Republic of Kazakhstan. This contrasts rather
   starkly with the endangered species' presence on the natural landscape
   there. Three contemporary cultural landscape sightings of the snow
   leopard in Kazakhstan-the Almaty zoological park, the Kazakhstan 2030
   strategy initiative, and the 2011 Asian Winter Games-are explored here.
   The positive imagery and symbolism linking the snow leopard to the
   Republic of Kazakhstan cements the non-human animal's status as an
   unofficial state symbol. The borderlands of snow leopard landscapes,
   those spaces of cultural and natural environmental overlap, are vital
   for conservation efforts. Reincorporating non-human animals into social
   science research offers the opportunity for cultural landscape
   investigations. For the snow leopard, cultural landscape research may
   prove as important as traditional natural landscape research in
   Kazakhstan and throughout this majestic non-human animal's territorial
   range.},

Title = {Renewable energy in Kazakhstan: Challenges to policy and governance},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In light of sluggish progress in developing renewable energy generation
   in Kazakhstan, this paper aims to investigate the perceptions and
   opinions of actors in the field regarding policy design and
   effectiveness of governance for renewables. Known for its vast natural
   resources including oil, gas, and coal, Kazakhstan has been using fossil
   fuels as a principal driver of its economy since 1991, when it gained
   the status of an independent nation. While policy on renewables and
   governance has been institutionalised since 2006, progress has been
   slow. Based on the data from in-depth interviews, the study identified
   that actors viewed policy design as a preliminary, although necessary,
   stage, subject to adjustments. The investors were concerned with
   multiple gaps and inconsistencies in the governance structure, and many
   walked away. The paper concludes that the use of active power of central
   government appeared insufficient for delivering results in policy design
   and governance. Making changes to its policy and governance, the
   government also needs to use its agenda-setting and preference-shaping
   power to ensure the engagement of investors, interest groups, local
   communities, and consumers for increasing renewable energy generation.},

Abstract = {After independence from the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan proclaimed Kazakhs
   the title ethnic group, and the Kazakh language the national language.
   This deprived the Russian-speaking population of its former dominant
   social position. Being a Russian-speaking citizen of Kazakhstan, the
   daughter of a half-Korean half-Russian father and a half-Kazakh
   half-German mother, I did my field work as a presumed native'
   anthropologist at Kazakhstan State University with linguistically
   divided groups of students. The relations between the field and the
   researcher disclosed different geopolitical realities of knowledge
   production and challenged the legacy of relativist methodology. I
   reflect on this experience and examine different conceptualisations of
   the native positionality in the post-Soviet context. Reflections in this
   paper raise new questions about nation-building in post-socialist states
   and about nativeness' itself, and contribute to the criticism of
   postmodern theory.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of networked forms of communication has captured the
   attention of media and scholars alike. We have never had quite as many
   resources for communication as we have today, and such communicative
   potential has implications for social change. In this article we
   consider public spheres that emerge through communication in the digital
   realm, paying attention to how networked publics operate within such
   spheres. We present results from a study of a popular local online
   discussion forum in Kazakhstan. Steeped in Habermass idea of the public
   sphere, this study focuses on cultural public spheres defined through
   engagement and participation of diverse publics. We consider a range of
   publics that might emerge, such as mundane-publics, issue-publics, and
   counter-publics and how these differ in their content and purpose. While
   the majority of work on networked publics has been situated in states
   with democratic forms of governance, we consider whether similar
   constructions are possible in an authoritarian state. We find that
   networked publics are not only present in an environment rife with
   online blocking and censorship, but take on a range of forms, generating
   participation that can at times result in substantial social change,
   despite the inability to hold open political discussions online.},

Abstract = {The recent Sino-Iranian agreement of March 2021 has been seen mainly in
   terms of its impact upon Irano-American and Irano-Chinese relations and
   the Middle East. This article, instead explores how this agreement
   affects the Indo-Chinese rivalry now occurring in South and Central
   Asia. It examines in great detail India's efforts to augment its
   position in Central Asia and how it has assigned Iran a prominent place
   in this campaign. Yet it failed to make the most of its chances, leaving
   the door open to China to step in and by this agreement undermine
   India's (and Russia's position) in South and Central Asia. The article
   focuses on trade and transportation issues as expressed in contending
   inter-continental trade and transport projects (the BRI and INSTC). But
   it concludes with an examination of the tie-in between the Sino-Iranian
   agreements and their overall implications of military and security
   issues throughout the Indian Ocean region and Central Asia. Thus, it
   ties together economic, trade, transportation, and security issues
   throughout South and Central Asia as well as the Indian Ocean Region

   article contributes to understanding factors that drive student transfer

   inductive coding of qualitative interviews with undergraduate transfer
   students in Kazakhstan, this research identifies student-centred factors
   of social embeddedness, parental influence in higher education
   decision-making, evolving career choice awareness, strategies for
   academic success, the quality of teaching and relationship ethics with
   students. While these factors influencing student transfer in Kazakhstan
   align with the existing Western context-based literature, the data in
   this research offer a localized perspective on what these factors mean
   in the context of a contemporary Central Asian country.},

Abstract = {This article details the origin and development of one of the core
   groups of the Central Asian (Kazakhstani) medieval architecture i.e.
   domed mausoleums; also it identifies the original traits of the medieval
   Kazakhstani mausoleums and their major locations centres. As determined
   by the authors so called dual code? was used as per building of medieval
   Central Asian mausoleums one of which corresponded to the generalized
   image of domed tomb as per the new ideology (Islam), and the second one
   matched the existing local forms and their decorative elements.
   Subsequently following several major compositional types of the Central
   Asian (Kazakhstan) mausoleums were formed and later on became standard
   i. e. - central, frontal, portal-domed ones. They served as the
   foundation for numerous architectural schools in Kazakhstan which
   developed further specific building structures, their details, elements
   proportions, facades divisions, decor, etc. In accordance with this, the
   genesis and main ways of forming the mausoleums on the territory of
   Kazakhstan was as follows - from single-chamber (central mausoleums,
   ``facade{''} and portal ones) compositions up to multi-chamber ones,
   Also compositional features \& specifics of the monuments of the main
   regional centres were revealed in the article. (C) 2019 Higher Education

Abstract = {Purpose
   Although many studies explored the drivers of innovative development and
   the innovation performance of different countries, very few studies
   looked at the association of the country's GII score with the
   qualitative indicators of innovation performance. The purpose of this
   paper is to contribute such an investigation by looking at the Republic
   of Kazakhstan (79th in 2019 GII ranking).
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study looks at eight dynamic variables, among which one dependent
   (the GII score) and seven independent (R\&D spending, innovation grants,
   the total cost of innovative goods and services, the percentage of
   innovative organizations, the share of innovative goods and services in
   gross domestic product (GDP) and the number of R\&D staff and R\&D
   institutions) variables associated with innovation performance. Changes
   in variables were tracked over the period from 2010 to 2018..
   Findings
   The study found that the Kazakhstan's GII score was reliant on
   variables, such as the percentage of innovative organizations, the value
   of innovative goods and services as a share of GDP, R\&D spending and
   the cost of innovative goods and services. At the same time, the number
   of R\&D institutions, innovation grants and number of R\&D staff had no
   substantial impact on the GII score of Kazakhstan.
   Originality/value
   Using the proposed approach, this study proved that factors, which have
   no direct association with the country's level of innovative development
   expressed in GII, could have a significant synergistic impact on this

Abstract = {Social work pioneer Jane Addams wrote of her experiences living and
   working with immigrant populations at the Hull-House in Chicago. In her
   writings, she describes a state of perplexity in which her personal and
   professional assumptions about the world were transformed through her
   interactions with that community. Perplexity is a liminal or in-between
   state of being in professional social work practice settings, which
   encourages the recognition of uncertainty, honors the dissonance between
   past assumptions and new understandings, and creates opportunities for
   meaningful relationships, personal growth, and social reform. This
   approach employs methods of mutual transformation through individual
   interpretations of experience, and holistic, critical practice. Our
   article argues that perplexity offers a useful alternative to social
   work approaches primarily based in mastery and expertise and is a good
   fit for the complex and diverse practice situations common to social
   work. By providing opportunities for truly collaborative understanding,
   engaging perplexity in social work is an innovative alternative to more
   linear, cause-and-effect thinking in the field. Specific elements of
   perplexity are discussed and paired with a case example from social work
   practice in Kazakhstan with implications for social work practice in
   other contexts.},

Abstract = {The theme of ``Russian influence{''} has been invading the think tank
   world. Yet the concept of influence must be deployed with care. Analysts
   have frequently assumed that, when states do things thought favourable
   to Russia, it must be because Moscow has either forced them to act in
   that manner, or has actively manipulated their domestic politics so that
   they do so. Left largely unconsidered are the various other reasons that
   one state might act in a manner desirable to another. In this article we
   look at the different vectors that might yield Russia-favorable behavior
   by Kazakhstan: exogenous ones that Russia actively and passively
   generates and endogenous ones that are passively or even actively
   generated within Kazakhstan itself. We discuss Russia's economic and
   strategic links with Kazakhstan, the issue of the Russian minority, the
   status of the Russian language, Russian media presence, Russia's
   governmental and non-governmental networks, and the ``payoff{''} of the
   latter three vectors: Kazakhstani popular Russophilia. By distinguishing
   between active and passive vectors, as well as between exogenous and
   endogenous ones, we propose a more nuanced and better theoretically
   articulated picture of Russia's ``influence{''} in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {The economy of Kazakhstan is locked into reliance on fossil fuel energy
   sources. Its government is seeking to diversify and deliver sustainable
   development. We develop an approach to decision-making to support
   critical decisions over the necessary \$67 billion in electricity
   investments to 2050 that can simultaneously contribute to a sustainable
   economy. We apply structured decision-making and cost-benefit analysis,
   align politically by incorporating the collective expertise of an
   interdisciplinary group of stakeholders to identify Policy Options,
   commercial assumptions and externalities, and fill data gaps using
   technical, economic and environmental data from global sources. Our
   approach quantifies net present value of these identified Policy
   Options, explores sensitivities, and suggests alternative investment
   pathway. Our results indicate policymakers should switch from coal and
   focus on harnessing the commercial and economic advantages of gas and
   hydropower for electricity generation. These options would be cheaper
   and have considerably lower emissions and water usage than the current
   production mix.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze economic and spatial determinants of
   interregional migration in Kazakhstan using quarterly panel data on
   region to region migration in 2008-2010. The main contribution of the
   paper relates to the ethnic divide in Kazakhstan, which is the home of a
   big ethnic Russian community, adding to the scarce literature on ethnic
   differences in migration patterns. Against this background we
   investigate whether the determinants of interregional mobility depend on
   ethnicity. In line with traditional economic theory we find that
   migration is determined by economic factors, first of all wage. As
   predicted by gravity arguments, mobility is larger between more
   populated regions and distance has a strong negative impact on
   migration, indicating high migration-related costs. Most likely caused
   by stronger family ties and kinship bonds, the deterring effect of
   distance is higher for ethnic Kazakhs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {19-36},
Abstract = {This article analyses the paradoxically central role of a railroad in
   Soviet economic growth in southern Tajikistan's Vakhsh River valley
   during the 1930s. Constructed as a secondary service road of the
   Vakhshstroi agro-industrial complex, it was not meant to support
   enterprises throughout the region. Because of the republic's lack of
   roads, however, unrelated freightage operations gravitated to the Vakhsh
   Railroad and made it the unintended mediator of the developing geography
   of Soviet movement. By examining how the narrow gauge line was used in
   unplanned ways, I find that state building under Stalin was
   characterized by improvisation in labour and mobility. Furthermore, the
   material conditions of transportation limited the locations of economic
   possibility in unanticipated ways. This case demonstrates that studying
   the use of infrastructure can further historical understanding of
   causes, effects and chronologies of economic life in the Stalin era.},

Abstract = {In Central Asia, various arguments, ranging from a unifying purpose to
   political control to conflict potential, have been made about the
   relationship between downstream water utilisation and the upstream water
   control infrastructure. This paper analyses the construction and
   utilisation of the Nurek dam in Tajikistan during and after the break-up
   of the Soviet Union. The political and socioeconomic changes that ensued
   after independence influenced the utilisation of the water control
   infrastructure. The new economic reorientation of Tajikistan demanded by
   the break-up caused concerns to downstream riparian states. The conflict
   potential is based not on water resource allocation, but on the
   utilisation of water for energy production, its control and transmission
   infrastructure. Even though there is conflict potential, the situation
   could be turned into a win-win situation for all the riparian states.

Abstract = {Repeated geodetic (ground and satellite) and gravimetric observations
   were carried out at the geodynamic test site at the Zhanazhol oil field
   (Kazakhstan) in 2010-2013. The results of leveling observations were
   analyzed, and local anomalies of Earth's surface vertical displacements
   in fault zones were revealed. Comparison of the results of ground-based
   and satellite geodetic observations showed that the distribution of
   vertical displacements of the Earth's surface obtained from GNSS
   measurements are in sharp contradiction with the releveling data. A
   paradoxical discrepancy between the ratio of vertical and horizontal
   displacements of the Earth's surface throughout the entire field has
   been established. It is shown that in areas of maximum uplift or
   subsidence of the surface, intense horizontal displacements are
   observed, which contradicts the laws of geomechanics for deep objects
   with volumetric deformation. In these areas, horizontal displacements
   should have zero or minimum horizontal movement amplitude. The results
   of repeated leveling and gravimetric observations are compared. A
   regular relationship has been revealed between local subsidence of the
   Earth's surface in fault zones and variations in the gravitational
   field. A correspondence has been established between the sign of
   displacements of the Earth's surface (subsidence, uplift) and the
   features of development of the field. It is proposed to use geodynamic
   monitoring as a method for additional monitoring of field development
   processes.},

   productivity growth that can potentially improve the current and future
   competitiveness of Kazakhstan's wheat producers. The paper emphasizes
   that the wheat system cannot operate in isolation from the rest of the

Abstract = {Using a comparative study of farm households from poor rural communities
   in Kyrgyzstan and north-east Romania this paper explores the intricacies
   of a variety of forms of cooperation in agriculture. The findings
   highlight the safety net, labour specialisation, asset-pooling and
   service delivery functions of different groups that enable rural
   livelihoods to, at times, cope and tat times improve in situations of
   imperfect information, sluggish labour and land markets, and constrained
   capital markets. The research presented here indicates that small to
   medium forms of cooperation provide the rural poor with predictable
   livelihood strategies under conditions of uncertainty. Specifically,
   cooperative action, in the form of groups, substitutes for imperfect
   markets. Despite the push for decollectivisation and privatisation
   across transition countries there remains a place for encouraging group
   initiatives, at least for the medium term, on the grounds of both
   poverty alleviation and agricultural growth.},

Abstract = {The current study seeks to understand the nature of gender relations
   within a post-Soviet welfare model in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia.
   On the basis of the analysis of key labour market indicators, parental
   leave, and childcare policies, it finds that the welfare models in the
   three countries are hybrid, and neither authoritarianism in Kazakhstan
   and Russia nor democracy in Mongolia lead to substantive gender equality
   outcomes. Persistent gender inequality in these countries is underpinned
   by the neo-liberal approach to welfare provision, conservative social
   norms, and limited agency of civil society to influence the policy
   agenda. Nonetheless, these states have distributed to the population
   with an emphasis on working mothers, and this policy choice has been
   driven by economic, demographic, and political considerations, which
   ultimately serve to support, rather than transform, the patriarchal
   power structure in these societies.},

Abstract = {This paper explores ``Ata Zhol,{''} a spiritual trend. Shamans (sunkars
   and akkus) have been mediators between disappointed spirits (aruaks) and
   people. They have given a blessing (bata) from a spirit to a person,
   have healed and brought people to sacred places. Sufis established a
   tradition of going on trips to sacred places. While Sufis were spreading
   Islam, they accepted ancestor worship of nomads, although Arabian Islam
   denies ancestor worship. Thus, shamans have been involved in the revival
   of Folk Islam, Kazakh Islam or Sufi Islam. Shamans of the ``Ata Zhol{''}
   are not traditional shamans (baksy). In contrast to traditional shamans,
   they are not connected with the lower level of spirits (water, woods,
   jins or Albasty). They can give bata, keeping clarity of mind (not faint
   and do not roll eyes). In addition, there is a revival of spiritism at a
   personal level, because participants cannot deny all the words of
   shamans.},

Abstract = {Globalised labour migration and remittances can help alleviate household
   poverty and provide supplemental income in many countries. Kyrgyzstan,
   like other Central Asian countries, has experienced dramatic
   geopolitical changes, economic reform, and rapid demographic shifts in
   the post-Soviet-Union era. Based on measurements of GDP, it is one of
   the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. This study uses
   data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan Study collected from 2011 to 2013 to
   break down household budgets into eight consumption categories as part
   of a detailed analysis of how varying remittance receipt is related to
   household spending. We address two methodological concerns: (1) the
   endogeneity of remittances and (2) population heterogeneity. In so
   doing, we find remittances have limited effects on household spending -
   while changes in remittances do yield small changes on the budget shares
   of food and medical expenses, no effects were found on other consumption
   shares. These results suggest that households in Kyrgyzstan may take
   remittances as permanent income and proportionally alter consumption
   shares along with changes in remittances. By focusing on a country whose
   GDP relies heavily on remittances, the findings increase our
   understanding of how remittances affect spending at the household level.},

Abstract = {In this study, changes in natural gas reserve/production ratio (R/P) of
   the four countries having the highest natural gas reserves (Russia,
   Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan), the importance of which increases in the
   world market each day due to developing technology and the demand for
   clean energy, has been analyzed depending on the economic and political
   developments in national and international fields. Change of R/P ratio
   depending on years has been displayed on graphics from different sources
   and these alterations have been tried to be associated with such issues
   as natural gas agreements in history, hand over of political authority,
   economic crises etc. Therefore; it has been put forward whether or not
   political and economic changes of the countries are factors on the
   amount of natural gas production and the discovery of new reserve fields
   with the addition aim of providing a general overview on natural gas
   market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ideological discourses in post-Soviet Uzbekistan: internationalization
   of higher education as a threat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Abstract = {Ideological discourses of Central Asia have been subject to much
   research. However, the use and the role of ideological discourses in
   framing internationalization of education policy has been largely
   overlooked. While much has been studied on how and why
   internationalization of higher education (HE) became indispensable part
   of tertiary sector, the cases where internationalization of HE is
   confronted by a government ideology agenda has largely remained outside
   of scholarly attention. This pioneering research offers analysis on
   ideology-based resistance to internationalization of education in
   authoritarian regimes. The paper argues that it is the framing of
   internationalization as a threat to national ideologies and a national
   model of education that confronts HE internationalization in some
   authoritarian political orders. The paper uses the case of post-Soviet
   Uzbekistan that promoted national ideologies as the basis of its
   education model. To support its argument, the paper analyses the
   official discourses of former President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan
   (1991-2016) and the statements of government officials on the country's
   national education model. It also analyses the interviews held with
   staff of HE institutions in Tashkent.},

Abstract = {This paper offers an insight into Uzbekistan's innovation system by
   adopting an inductive approach and studying the system along the example
   of altogether five different agricultural innovations (five case
   studies) entered into the national system of innovation screening for
   potential outscaling. The data suggest that there are missing linkages
   and a weak institutional infrastructure in the field of innovation
   diffusion in Uzbekistan and thus we argue that there is `knowledge

   place. Nevertheless, this bears the potential to support the development

Abstract = {After two violent episodes in the cities of Aktobe and Almaty during the
   summer of 2016, Islamic extremism resurfaced forcibly as an object of
   securitization in Kazakhstan. By focusing on anti-terror simulations and
   the performance of a theater play in the city of Aqtau, in this paper I
   argue that encounters with security measures and performances are
   formative moments for people's sensual apprehension of ``the threat{''}
   and ``the state{''} through the circulation of affects and emotions,
   lending a visceral dimension to the understanding of (in)security.
   Rather than uncritically enhancing the need for further securitization,
   the affective encounters were constitutive of wider political
   assessments, and of the very sense and meaning of ``security{''}.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and
   joined the Commonwealth of Independent States. Since then it has
   witnessed a remarkable economic transformation under the leadership of
   President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Pursuing a policy of `economy first and
   then politics', Kazakhstan is under growing pressure to engage in
   political reforms which include a modernization agenda to improve public
   service provision. Recent constitutional reforms have received a
   lukewarm reaction from the international community that Kazakhstan is
   keen to become part of. At the same time a progressive agenda of public
   services reform is well under way rooted in new public management and a
   desire to become much more customer focussed in their orientation. This
   article examines the parallel themes of political reforms and public
   services modernization in Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Ecological houses of Southern Kazakhstan using renewable energy sources},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-607},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this article discusses the design of underground
   eco-houses using a dome structure of light construction while taking
   into account the historical experience of the development of the local
   population. This article considered the traditions of folk architecture
   and modern sophistication in the creation of energy-efficient eco-houses
   in foreign countries in the context of architecture and construction of
   affordable residential homes for the local population.
   Design/methodology/approach The research presented in this paper was
   motivated by the need for developing agro-tourism facilities in
   hard-to-reach areas of the Silk Road in Southern Kazakhstan causes the
   construction of eco-houses built using local construction materials.
   Since ancient times in Southern Kazakhstan and during seasonal
   migrations in yurts of light construction, people have lived in
   mud-brick houses deep in the ground. Along with architectural and
   artistic solutions in building construction, great importance was
   attached to saving material resources, labour costs and achieving heat
   stability of residential buildings. Findings In the architectural and
   planning solution of the eco not sign -house, progressive directions of
   construction of agrotechnical structures using renewable energy sources
   are adopted. Particular importance was given to the choice of the
   construction site on an elevated area nearby historical monuments and a
   favourable season for the construction of eco-houses with considering
   the natural and climatic characteristics of rural areas of Southern
   Kazakhstan. Research limitations/implications This paper discussed the
   issues of insulation, ventilation and improving the eco-house
   microclimate comfort using local building materials. Improving the
   architectural and artistic expressiveness of the eco-house in terms of
   the tradition of folk architecture was also explicitly discussed in this
   paper. Practical implications Tables with the justification of
   expediency of construction of economical eco-houses in natural and
   climatic conditions of Kazakhstan and Central Asia are provided. The
   results help to improve the energy efficiency of eco-houses in
   Kazakhstan by using renewable energy sources. Social implications Social
   benefits are associated with the use of local raw materials. Eco-houses
   built from traditional building materials can become accessible to a
   wide range of people and stimulate the development of small businesses.
   This may be associated with the construction of eco-houses to serve
   visiting tourists in remote picturesque oases, as well as the
   manufacture of dome structures, felt products and the preparation of
   reed panels and so on. Originality/value The thermotechnical
   characteristics of the region's ground energy are given, which can
   significantly save the cost of heating the eco-house. Solutions for
   optimal insolation, ventilation of the eco-house are provided, taking
   into account the natural and climatic conditions of Southern Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The development of an innovative economy is constrained by the
   problems of science funding, modernization of scientific institutions
   and innovative training of specialists. This article focuses on the
   problem of evaluating the effectiveness of the innovation infrastructure
   of the Republic of Kazakhstan using a systematized set of performance
   indicators.
   Methodology/Approach: Approaches to assessing innovation infrastructure
   have been analysed. Based on the analysis, correlation and regression
   assessment model has been developed.
   Findings: A forecast has been made for innovative infrastructure
   development based on the obtained performance indicators. This forecast
   is of high practical significance, as it allows predicting the outcomes
   of innovation.
   Research Limitation/implication: In the light of globalization, it is
   extremely urgent to develop an innovative economy along with regional
   innovation systems. If combined, these systems can accelerate the
   innovation processes in the regions, ensure competitiveness and expedite
   the socio-economic development. The formation of an innovative economy
   should be in line with the productive forces and production relations.
   Originality/Value of the paper: Through categorization, this study
   establishes a set of underlying indicators, which are used to measure
   the performance of the innovation infrastructure. A model of correlation
   and regression analysis is built, which allows evaluating the

Abstract = {Under the current conditions in forming the corps of civil servants, the
   professionalism and competence of civil servants comes to be of
   paramount importance. The pace of deterioration in the growth of
   knowledge has lead to objectively emerging contradictions between civil
   servants' competency and continuously emerging new technologies.
   Therefore, continuous training is the basis for the constant improvement
   of knowledge and acquiring new socially important skills for civil
   servants in Kazakhstan. However, it oft en happens that in practice the
   planning of an educational process is carried out without a preliminary
   assessment of training needs, which leads to inefficiency in the whole
   learning process. The purpose of this article is to identify the main
   areas needed for the training of civil servants in Kazakhstan. This
   article is a report on a conducted study which focuses on the following
   research questions: (1) What are the common problems regarding knowledge
   and skills among civil servants? (2) What training content is currently
   required for civil servants? Research methods include online
   questionnaires and focus groups with civil servants, as well as
   interviews with international experts. Key areas of professional
   development in the civil service have been identified based on the
   respondents' answers. The results confirm that civil servants
   universally recognize that certainly there are some gaps between what is
   required to perform their work completely and what they actually know.
   The focus and methodology of the training also requires critical
   attention.},

Title = {A FUZZY METHODOLOGY FOR LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE EVALUATION:

Abstract = {This paper assesses the local entrepreneurial culture based on the
   perceptions of local residents, by focusing on four distinct dimensions
   of the local entrepreneurial culture: `diversity and change climate',
   `business promotion climate', `business discouragement climate', and
   `focus on local'. A comprehensive survey was used to assess the local
   entrepreneurial culture in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The items included in
   the survey were categorised as positive or negative statements that
   describe the respondent's county. This paper provides a framework that
   consists of a two-level model to construct a quantitative measure of
   local entrepreneurial culture. Essentially, a fuzzy artificial decision
   is based on data collected by conducting the survey with entrepreneurs
   and non-entrepreneurs. At the top level, a fuzzy multicriteria
   decision-making model was used to measure the local entrepreneurial
   culture. This model assesses the entrepreneurial culture in the
   community development practices of managers, contributes to future
   entrepreneurial research, identifies practices for entrepreneurial
   culture, and assesses the role of local cultural characteristics in
   entrepreneurship. This study includes a novel methodology, compared with
   those described in the literature, as it includes a conceptual model
   based on the perceptions of local residents. The results of this study
   showed that Bishkek's entrepreneurial culture is below the middle level.},

Abstract = {In recent years, social and cultural geographers have begun to
   interrogate the relationship between memory, space and identity in the
   towns and cities of post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan. This article advances this
   research agenda by comparing top-down, or elite, interventions in the
   commemorative landscape of a Kyrgyzstani city with those taking place
   from the bottom-up level and being inscribed at street level. Nowhere
   are the processes of memorialisation and identity building more keenly
   felt than in Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second city and one which is still
   recovering from the emotional and physical damage inflicted by 2010's
   violent inter-ethnic riots. Focusing on changes in the commemorative
   landscape of Osh since the 2010 Events, this article interrogates the
   construction of a number of large-scale monuments in the city in recent
   years, whilst also setting out a number of narratives of memory that
   seem to have been inscribed in the more mundane spaces of the city.
   Comparing and contrasting these narratives enables the researcher to
   uncover patterns of convergence and conflict between the narratives of
   memory privileged by the city authorities and those expressed by
   non-elite actors, and warns that such conflicts risk being exacerbated
   by planned changes to the physical fabric of the city.},

   offering an alternative to theories focusing on lead firm-supplier
   relations or global value chains when investigating violations of

Booktitle = {COTTON, WATER, SALTS AND SOUMS: ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL RESTRUCTURING IN
   KHOREZM, UZBEKISTAN},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {113-126},
Abstract = {Following independence in 1991, the need for a more efficient and stable
   agricultural production in Uzbekistan led to the institutional
   transformation of the main agricultural producers, the collectively
   owned shirkats, to privately owned farms. This transformation, which was
   completed between 2004 and 2006, inter alia required corresponding
   changes in the agricultural service-providing organizations (ASP). The
   efficiency and functioning of such organizations in the Khorezm region
   of Uzbekistan is the main research topic of this study. Data were
   collected through interviews with farmers and representatives of three
   types of ASP: machinery and tractor parks (MTP - mawuho-mpakmophblu napk
   (Russian) since Soviet times, the fleet of tractors and machines is
   called machine-tractor park), distribution outlets for selling fuel and
   mineral fertilizers, and mini-banks. Farmers were asked to give their
   qualitative assessment of the service provision and functioning of these
   service organizations. The ASP representatives provided both a
   qualitative and a quantitative assessment of their interaction with
   farmers. The financial performance of the ASP was analyzed to assess
   their ability to render full and timely services to farmers. Research
   results indicate serious flaws in the examined current service provision
   to farmers. Most problems can be grouped around (i) poor enforcement of
   property rights, because in particular local authorities frequently
   interfered with the internal decision-making process of both ASPs and
   farmers, thus affecting their activities; (ii) poor corporate management
   because the elected heads of the ASPs needed approval of their
   nomination from local authorities, which led to their direct
   accountability to local authorities irrespective of the business
   interests of the ASPs; (iii) weak contractual relations owing to
   violations of the contractual terms by both ASPs (caused by for instance
   the lack of machinery or other inputs of ASPs) and farmer/clients
   (caused by the lack of working capital). This, in turn, caused delays in
   service provision to farmers and untimely payments for the services
   rendered. The services were frequently not completed. Moreover, the
   results of the analyses show that commercial banks and their mini-bank
   branches in the villages constantly faced cash and liquidity problems,
   whilst farmers did not have direct access to their bank accounts. It is
   therefore argued that local authorities should attempt to interfere less
   with the activities of the ASPs and private farms.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the impact of international remittances on
   health outcomes. While the existing literature finds that remittances
   increase healthcare expenditure, expenditure alone is an incomplete
   proxy for health outcomes. Consequently, this article explores the
   impact of remittances on proxies for health outcomes beyond expenditure
   and for all household members (adults and children). It uses an
   instrumental variable approach to control for the endogeneity of
   remittances and finds a mostly positive relationship between remittances
   and health outcomes. This article also explores several possible
   transmission channels for how remittances affect health, finding that
   remittances have a positive and significant effect on household members'
   likelihood of seeking direct medical care. It confirms remittances'
   positive role in improving the welfare of the receivers and emphasizes
   the importance of distinguishing between remittances and other income
   sources in terms of their effects on development.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers of university and
   industry cooperation and to develop recommendations for the internal
   ecosystem of technology commercialization. The research method used is a
   survey of three categories of experts from 9 universities of Almaty
   (researchers, technology transfer managers, spin-off-owners). Despite
   the strong efforts of the government of Kazakhstan in building
   innovation infrastructure, there is a low level of innovation activity,
   less than 5\% of university inventions are transferred into the
   industry. The results of the expert survey showed that the main barriers
   for cooperation between university and industry are: lack of resources
   to build university-industry links, lack of time due to high teaching
   load, poor qualification of technology transfer managers and lack of
   networking with industry. Based on the results of the expert survey, it
   is proposed to develop the ecosystem for the commercialization of
   university-based technologies, for which the following economic
   activities are important: human resources, financing, intellectual
   property management system, and intermediary infrastructure. The results
   of this study can be applied in developing the strategies and policies
   for universities, public research organizations, as well as for national
   R\&D and higher education policies.},

Abstract = {The moral education, the formation of the mental integrity of a person
   is one of the priorities of the education system. However, in connection
   with globalization, market conditions of the service sector, the role of
   the teacher as a bearer of moral potential is depreciating. The purpose
   of this article it's theoretical study of aspects moral education. The
   new State Program pays a lot of attention to the development of
   well-integrated individual. The capitalistic market relationships
   changed a structure and curriculum of education. We did not realize a
   long time that it can lead to not pleasant consequences. But today it is
   already impossible, assimilating to an ostrich, to pretend that in a
   moral condition of society nothing bad occurs. The scandals which even
   more often are splashing out in media and in a social network
   demonstrate that the situation can get out of hand.},

Abstract = {How do marriages fare during times of dramatic social, political and
   economic transition? Transitional societies offer a unique context for
   studying marital instability as they are often buffeted by
   countervailing forces of modernisation and re-traditionalisation, in
   addition to socio-economic and political changes. Using detailed and
   rich data from Kyrgyzstan, the study investigates trends over time in
   marital instability in response to societal upheavals and gradual
   secular transformations; ethnic group-specific responses in marital
   instability; and the role of changing gender regimes in marital
   instability. The findings reveal an increase in the rate of marital
   dissolution over time. However, ethnic group-specific differentials
   remained significant, mirroring the historically shaped relative
   positioning of the groups in the process of demographic change. The
   results also highlight gender differentials in the influence of
   education and employment on marital instability. The findings are
   discussed within the broader framework of demographic and social changes
   in transitional Central Asia.},

Abstract = {Imaginations of existential threat do not only express themselves in
   exceptional actions - as prominently suggested by securitization theory
   - but also in routine, day-to-day practices. They can become a part of
   `normal' life. We demonstrate this by following the everyday activities
   of individuals from the Lyuli as well as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   transgender (LGBT) community in Kyrgyzstan. Individuals from both groups
   actively and consciously secure themselves by employing a mix of
   practices that range from deterrence and open confrontation to
   avoidance, adaptation and hiding tactics. For the purpose of tracing and
   discussing these activities, our article develops and applies the
   innovative concept of securityscapes.},

Abstract = {How can we understand the signing of legislation targeting violence
   against women in postcommunist countries where women are electorally
   marginalized? Although women are underrepresented in Kyrgyzstan, the
   country's parliament has passed bride theft and domestic violence
   legislation. This article proposes a theory of transactional activism:
   in postcommunist countries where women are electorally marginalized,
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) can instigate legislative change if
   the state satisfies three necessary conditions permitting lateral links
   between NGOs working on behalf of women and vertical links between these
   nonstate actors and critical actors in parliament. The state must (1)
   establish a regulatory framework for NGO activity permitting the
   articulation and representation of women's interests; (2) demonstrate a
   rhetorical commitment to improving women's lives; and (3) facilitate the
   election to parliament of critical actors sympathetic to women's
   interests. In other words, women's substantive representation can occur
   without strong descriptive representation in the formal legislative
   arena if the state satisfies these conditions.},

Abstract = {This article aims to show how traditionalization is enforced by women in
   Tajikistan in the realm of marriage, focusing on the economic dimension
   of life cycle rituals: ritual expenditure and gift-giving. It shows that
   from women's points of view, performing ceremonial competition may
   itself be a resource to recover their reputation, for example when a
   matrimonial rupture has harmed it. Focusing on single mothers, it
   demonstrates how practices of traditionalization performed by women can
   be directed at addressing gender constraints and stereotypes, such as
   the normative relation between marriage and femininity, and how they may
   also secure women's separate sphere of competence and relative financial
   autonomy.},

   staying behind: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {40-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the growth of alcohol consumption and international migration in
   many developing countries, the links between the two remain
   underexplored. We study the relationship between emigration of household
   members, receiving remittances (migrant monetary transfers), and alcohol
   consumption of migrant household members staying behind in Kyrgyzstan, a
   poor post-socialist country that has recently witnessed both large-scale
   emigration and a rise in alcohol-related health problems. Using a large
   longitudinal survey, we find that, among the ethnic majority (Kyrgyz),
   an increase in migrant remittances is associated with a higher
   likelihood and frequency of consuming alcohol, as well as an increase in
   the consumption of beer. Among ethnic Russians, the emigration of family
   members who do not send remittances back home is associated with an
   increased likelihood and frequency of alcohol consumption. We discuss
   possible mechanisms through which emigration and remittances may affect
   the alcohol consumption of those staying behind, including the
   relaxation of budget constraints and psychological distress. Overall,
   our findings suggest that the emigration of household members contribute
   to a greater alcohol consumption among those staying behind, and
   highlight the role of remittances and cultural background in
   understanding the nuances in this relationship.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Global food production faces immense pressure, much of which can be
   attributed to climate change. A detailed evaluation of the impact of
   climate change on the yield of staple crops in Kazakhstan, a major food
   exporter, is required for more scientific planting management. In this
   study, the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen Median slope were used to
   determine climate trends and staple food yields over the past 30 years;
   random forest was used to analyze the importance of monthly climatic
   factors; states were classified according to climatic factors through
   systematic clustering method; and lastly, the influence of climate on
   yield was analyzed using panel regression models. The upward trend in
   wind speed and potato yield throughout Kazakhstan was apparent.
   Furthermore, barley and wheat yields had increased in the southeast. We
   determined that for wheat, frostbite should be prevented after the
   warmer winters in the high-latitude areas. Except for July-August in the
   low-latitude areas, irrigation water should be provided in the other
   growth periods and regions. As similar effects were reported for barley,
   the same preventive measures would apply. For potatoes, tuber rot,
   caused by frost or excessive precipitation in May, should be prevented
   in high-latitude areas; soil dryness should be alleviated during the
   germination and seedling stages in low-latitude areas; and irrigation
   and cooling should be maintained during tuber formation and maturation.
   Furthermore, hot dry air in March and April could damage the crops.},

Abstract = {We study the impact of a large-scale economic crisis on gender equality,
   using historical data from Kazakhstan in the late 19th-early 20th
   century. We focus on sex ratios (number of women per man) in Kazakh
   population between 1898 and 1908, in the midst of large-scale Russian
   in-migration into Kazakhstan that caused a sharp exogenous increase in
   land pressure. The resulting severe economic crisis made the nomadic
   organization of the Kazakh economy unsustainable and forced most Kazakh
   households into sedentary agriculture. Using a large novel dataset
   constructed from Russian colonial expedition materials, we document a
   low and worsening sex ratio (in particular, among poor households)
   between 1898 and 1908. The theoretical hypothesis that garners most
   support is that of excess female mortality in poorer households
   (especially among adults), driven by gender discrimination under the
   increasing pressure for scarce food resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {This paper examines the determinants of migration between Kazakhstan and
   Russia for different age groups and by urban/rural residence, using
   monthly data for the period 1995 to 1999. Using reconciled migration
   data and a comparable macroeconomic data set for the two countries,
   these monthly data make it possible to assess different groups'
   responses to differential economic events. We find a virtually immediate
   response to the 1998 Russian financial crisis and to relative exchange
   rate movements. However, longer lags apply to the response to
   construction activity and to wage differentials. Movements in real
   pensions do not induce important responses. (C) 2005 Association for

Abstract = {Although post-Soviet Central Asian societies self-identify as Muslim,
   spiritual identity is a highly contested subject in the region and one
   influenced by Russian imperialism and Soviet atheist ideology. In
   Kyrgyzstan, a transnational Islamic movement, the Tablighi Jama'at
   Network (TJN) calling for a purification of Islamic practices, competes
   not only with the practitioners of `Soviet traditional Islam' deeply
   rooted in Kyrgyz ethnic customs and traditional culture, but also with
   the proponents of the pre-Islamic beliefs of Tengriism, all against the
   background of deeply-ingrained Soviet notions of modernity. On the basis
   of a close analysis of two Kyrygz films, Ernest Abdyzhaparov's Saratan.
   Village Authorities (2004) and Aktan Arym Kubat's Centaur (2017), this
   article examines negotiations of spiritual identity in contemporary
   Kyrgyz cinema at the intersection of global and local Islam, pre-Islamic
   traditions, and Soviet-imparted spiritual secularism as a complex
   process navigated by the Soviet generation of filmmakers who are
   apprehensive of Islamic global movements and emerging dominant religious
   narratives as an `alien' ideology aiming to suppress Central Asians'
   cultural diversity and authenticity. Responding to Russo-Soviet
   ideological imperialism and Islamic fundamentalism, these artists
   negotiate their culture's multiplicity and ambivalence while drawing on
   regional diversity and nomadic roots.},

Abstract = {Kazakh literature is spreading from Kazakhstan's present territory,
   including the age of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, the territory

   Kazakhs, there is some overlap with other complementary themes,
   including the literature of Turkic tribes that populated Kazakhstan. In
   the modern literature of Kazakhstan, the family theme has a compound
   development. It aims to reflect all the pressing problems associated
   with the institution of the family. Discord in the family, betrayal as
   unfaithfulness, the negative impact on children of conflicts between
   adults - all these problems of the modern family are reflected in the
   literature. Especially in the women's novel, the trend of mastering such
   a phenomenon of our society as polygamy is becoming more and more
   popular. The problems of relations between tokal (the second wife) and
   baibishe (the first wife), the reasons for men's infidelity and their
   frequent desire to create a second family are the subject of artistic
   interpretation in modern Kazakh prose.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {29-38},
Abstract = {The article presents an analysis of modern Kazakhstani discourse, which
   is considered as a constructed text. Statistical data on media
   preferences confirm author's conclusions on the characteristic features
   of Kazakhstani mass consciousness, including those expressed in the
   medial space. In this paper, we analyze the psychological, semiotic,
   sociological, culturological and psycholinguistic approaches to the
   phenomena of the medial sphere. Within the framework of the critical
   discourse analysis theory, the article outlines the rhetorical
   strategies of social cognition and perception, expressed in mass
   consciousness. We also make an attempt to compare the newest cognitive
   studies of the language in American practice with the leading European
   discourse studies. On the basis of the selected correlation of cognitive
   theory and the theory of medial analysis, the author develops a model of
   analysis for conceptual space of the media discourse. The thesis of
   Sovietization of Kazakhstani medial space is confirmed by the analysis
   of samples of mass culture and rhetorical features of Kazakhstani
   discourse. In the work we present exclusive psycholinguistic data -
   associative fields to the ideological concepts of linguistic
   consciousness, which have a predictive nature for interdisciplinary
   research. The article reveals the trends and examples of official and
   mass discourse - the ideological ``products{''} of our time: from the
   surviving Soviet cliches to the newly created national identity. The
   revealed features of the Kazakhstani media discourse have specific
   character of the manifestation of post - Soviet culture. It shows that,
   the return to traditional attitudes was reflected in the rhetorical
   strategies of communication, and is revealed by the authors of this

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {107},

Abstract = {This article traces the evolution of land protection in the Pamir
   Mountains of Tajikistan. The Pamirs form the Roof of the World, where
   the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Tian Shan, and Kunlun Shan ranges converge.
   Field and archival research identified (1) the origin and diffusion of
   parks and protected areas across the globe, (2) the biophysical
   properties of the Pamir Mountains that inspired the conservation
   efforts, (3) the sequence of land protection from national park to
   supranational World Heritage recognition, and (4) the characteristics of
   the Pamir Mountains that justify UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status. Stalin
   forcefully depopulated these highlands in the 1930s. Tense Soviet-Sino
   relations in the 1960s and the prolonged Soviet-Afghan war further
   restricted human movements. When Gorbachev's perestroika allowed return
   migration in the mid-1980s, Tajik farmers and Kirghiz pastoralists
   resettled a landscape of thriving plants and wildlife. Concurrently, a
   nascent coalition of citizen scientists and government officials began
   advocating for a park. In 1992 the government established the Tajik
   National Park to protect environmental and sacred sites, promote
   traditional economic activity, and develop tourism. The antecedent
   Soviet collapse, civil war, economic upheaval, and renewed conflict in
   Afghanistan, however, complicated land protection. In 2013, UNESCO
   designated the Tajik National Park as a World Heritage Site.
   Establishing a Biosphere Reserve is the next step to promoting
   transboundary conservation with the adjacent protected areas in China,
   Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The potential reserve size, terrain, and
   demographic trajectory are consistent with the Man and the Biosphere
   model.},

Abstract = {The growth of the Higher Education and Science (HES) sector is
   positively associated with its research productivity and has a high
   potential in emerging countries. To explore such research productivity,
   this study offers a comprehensive analysis of the scientific literature
   from Kazakhstan. Our methods included descriptive analysis, network
   analysis, and author-based productivity analysis (by Lotka's law) of
   23,371 articles from Scopus, published during 1991-2020, and across 25
   subject areas. The results of the descriptive analysis showed a
   substantial increase in the number of and citations to the literature
   since 2011 in almost all subject areas. However, the network analysis
   found that research in natural sciences was more developed in topical
   relationships and international collaborations than research in arts and
   humanities, social, and medical sciences. The Lotka's law application
   revealed that the overall scientific literature in Kazakhstan did not
   reach its necessary stage of maturity. Additionally, some subject areas
   demonstrated greater contribution to the overall knowledge base, while
   others were less productive or lagging in their development. Our
   findings, useful for researchers and policymakers in emerging countries,
   can be exemplary in understanding the results of policy reforms aimed to
   improve the HES sector in emerging countries.},

   of the Tatar population played the significant role in the distribution
   of the ideas of Muslim-Turkic unity. The reasons of the defeat of a

   nomads and powerful influence of daily occurrence of the interethnic
   relations which led to the wide circulation of the Russian culture which
   was the conductor of westernization of the Kazakh society reveal. The
   critical role in the choice of a civil way of development of Kazakhs was
   played by the Russian and Kazakh educators creating the Russian-Kazakh
   schools and the Kazakh schools with teaching in Russian. Founders of the
   Kazakh national movement Alash mainly studied at the Russian-Kazakh
   schools of northern and western districts of the region and in higher

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impacts of international migration and
   remittances on different sources of income in rural Kyrgyzstan. Based on
   a household dataset from the Life in Kyrgyzstan panel survey of 1012
   rural households, we estimate equations for crop income, livestock
   income, and nonagricultural income jointly in a system using the
   seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) and general method of moments
   (GMM) three-stage least-squares (3SLS) estimators. Our results show that
   international migration had diverse effects on different sources of
   rural income in Kyrgyzstan. The effect of international migration in
   total was negative on crop income, but positive on livestock income and
   mixed for nonagricultural income. The positive effect of remittances on
   nonagricultural income implies that migration can promote
   diversification of rural households' income sources. This in turn is
   associated with less income uncertainty and risk in the future and can
   provide a positive contribution to the economic development of a
   migrant-sending community.},

Title = {The Integrated Hydropower Sustainability Assessment in Tajikistan: A
   Case Study of Rogun Hydropower Plant},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Tajikistan has formulated the strategy to rejuvenate the country through
   hydropower. The Rogun hydropower plant (HPP) is designed as the highest
   hydropower station, while its sustainability is also questioned due to a
   lack of comprehensive sustainability evaluation. Considering that the
   external environment of Rogun HPP is complex and changeable, its
   sustainable performance will be fragile and inconstant. To
   comprehensively assess the sustainable performance, an integrated
   evaluation framework, covering the current and dynamic sustainable
   performance, is urgently established. Therefore, this paper firstly
   explored the hydropower sustainability assessment indicators which can
   conform to Tajikistan's situations and further examined the current
   sustainable performance of Rogun HPP. The case study found that Rogun
   HPP's current financial viability, involuntary resettlement, the
   measures to prevent corruption, and information disclosure were
   seriously deficient. The SWOT analysis indicated the external factors,
   such as the Belt and Road Initiative, improving business environment,
   and easing geopolitical disputes, can eliminate weaknesses and improve
   the sustainable performance of Rogun HPP. At the same time, tight fiscal
   allocations and economic downturns will have negative influences on the
   sustainable performance. The integrated evaluation tool established in
   this paper can not only evaluate the current sustainable performance but
   also consider the impact of external factors on sustainable performance
   from a dynamic perspective. This paper contributes to the current
   knowledge system by establishing the hydropower sustainability
   assessment system which is suitable for Tajikistan's conditions.
   Moreover, the results are informative for the decision-makers to have a
   better understanding of Rogun HPP's current strengths and weaknesses,
   valuable opportunities, and potential threats.},

Abstract = {A key factor in the success of a technology is its use by target users.
   Therefore, the effectiveness of mobile learning depends on student
   acceptance. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to analyze the
   factors that influence university students' acceptance of mobile
   learning. This study is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and
   Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Thus, the study covered attitude,
   subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control as the major
   antecedents of students' behavioral intention to use mobile learning.
   The study was conducted during the 2020-2021 fall term at two different
   universities, which are a state university in Turkey, and a state
   university in Kyrgyzstan. There were a total of 400 participants,
   including 200 students from each country. Structural equation modeling
   (SEM) analysis was employed to investigate the effects of factors on
   participant students' behavioral intention to use mobile learning.
   Turkish and Kyrgyz students showed both similarities and differences in
   the effects of factors on mobile learning use. The results demonstrated
   that subjective norm and perceived behavioral control have a significant
   impact on the use of mobile learning by both Turkish and Kyrgyz
   students. While attitude has a significant effect on Kyrgyz students'
   acceptance of mobile learning, it has no significant effect on Turkish
   students' acceptance.},

Abstract = {When looking at important indicators of well-being, there is extensive
   evidence that levels of life satisfaction differ between ethnic groups,
   such that minority groups by and large tend to report lower levels of
   life satisfaction than majority ethnic groups. A growing body of
   literature has begun investigating the relationship between an
   individual's community and their own levels of life satisfaction. While
   community deprivation and community ethnic composition are important
   factors for understanding individual ethnic disparities in life
   satisfaction, there is a gap in understanding the role of community
   social cohesion, as well as the effect on change in life satisfaction
   over time. Using panel survey data from 5.207 adults living in 30
   sub-districts of rural Kyrgyzstan, we conduct a multilevel analysis of
   whether social cohesion serves as a moderator for the relationship
   between ethnicity and change in life satisfaction. While results do not
   demonstrate a positive effect of community social cohesion on change in
   life satisfaction, they do indicate that higher levels of community
   social cohesion minimize the ethnic group disparities in change in life
   satisfaction. These findings imply that social cohesion may be one
   additional piece of the puzzle in understanding ethnic disparities in
   life satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The irrigation sector constitutes the backbone of Uzbekistan's economy,
   providing social and economic stability in the region. The sector
   collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union, due to worsening of
   infrastructure conditions causing tensions among resource users.
   Subsequent irrigation management reforms were implemented in a top-down
   manner. More than a decade after the initial reforms - which established
   local Water Consumers Association (WCA) and transferred operation and
   maintenance responsibilities for on-farm irrigation canals - the poor
   performance of these associations is still apparent, illustrating the
   heritage of the strong role of state agencies in Uzbek water management
   that still affects collective irrigation management today. This paper
   identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for successfully
   managing common pool resources (CPRs) and, more specifically, irrigation
   canal maintenance in the rural Bukhara region of Uzbekistan. Fifteen
   WCAs were examined regarding conditions that may facilitate successful
   irrigation canal maintenance. Methods involved focus group discussions
   and in-depth interviews with the associations concerned. Data gathered
   was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The
   results indicate that two paths of local factors can lead to
   well-maintained irrigation canals: (1) the combination of appropriate
   chairmanship skills with sustainable resource appropriation or (2) the
   combination of appropriate chairmanship skills with the presence of
   effective participatory governance. The results also illustrate the role
   of path-dependence and traditional co-production of irrigation
   management in Uzbekistan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article examines the intellectual genealogy of a central tenet of
   contemporary nationalist discourse in Tajikistan, namely, the Aryan myth
   as the idea of the Tajiks' Aryan descent. The origins of this myth are
   discovered in Late Imperial Russia. Over the first decades of the
   twentieth century, through the early Soviet period, the Tajik Aryan myth
   would transform from a narrative legitimizing Russian imperial rule to a
   myth of Tajik national identity. The article shows how Tajikistan's
   imagining and formation as a nation-state was inextricably linked to the
   Aryan myth and to the way it was articulated by imperial
   scholars-turned-Soviet orientalists, such as Aleksandr Aleksandrovich
   Semenov (1873-1958). Taking the microhistorical perspective of a single
   life allows the author to highlight the local Central Asian dynamics of
   the complex imperial situation that paved the way to and accompanied
   Bolshevik nationalities policy. As a scholar with a certain political
   weight, Semenov managed to exploit the leeway for action in accordance
   with his own research interests (rather than acting as a mere instrument
   of the imperial and Soviet regimes in Central Asia). Consequently, the
   article argues that the process of delimiting borders and identities in
   1920s Central Asia was influenced not only by Moscow-based Bolsheviks
   and leading Central Asian Muslim political figures but also by Russian
   orientalists as distinctive historical actors.},

   and culture. But although these efforts delivered tangible results, they
   also had the (unintended) consequence of folklorizing and objectifying
   `culture', thereby partly re-inscribing the ethnic boundaries that they

Abstract = {This reflection focuses on teaching writing online for the first-year
   students in the Academic English course at the Westminster International
   University in Tashkent (WIUT), Uzbekistan. Academic English is a core
   course for all incoming first-year students and aims to develop
   students' proficiency in listening, reading, and writ-ing skills. A
   great emphasis is placed on the development of writing skills, and
   stu-dents are required to write at least four summaries, two essays, and
   one reflection during the twelve weeks of the first semester. A new
   challenging component in the autumn 2020 semester was teaching writing
   online, due to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   classroom writing processes were examined through the lens of the
   Self-and Socially-Regulated Multilingual Writing model (Akhmedjanova,
   2020), which revealed prevalence of socially-regulated rather than
   self-regulated writing practices. Also, teachers instructed students to
   use revi-sion strategies more than planning and formulating writing
   strategies. A cursory examination of students' reflections suggested
   that many students struggled with the environment and time management
   skills. Future revisions to the Academic English course should include
   explicit teaching of planning and formulating writing strate-gies along
   with planning and time management skills.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Irrigation facilities in the cold winter deserts (CWDs) of Uzbekistan
   are very traditional and poorly managed, resulting in low water use
   efficiency and low productivity. Improving the irrigation facilities in
   these deserts is a key priority for the country. This study intended to
   contribute towards the development of the irrigation systems through
   identification and quantification of the relative implicit values
   smallholder farmers confer to the key characteristics of irrigation
   facilities. We elicited preferences with discrete choice experiments,
   estimated willingness to pay for these attributes using random
   parameters logit models, and analyzed heuristics in the choice process
   using a series of latent class models. Our results show that farmers
   have clear preferences for higher watering frequency and no interest in
   sharing irrigation water with downstream users. We also observed that
   there are distinct groups of farmers with comparable but different
   levels of preference. The development of irrigation facilities in the
   water-scarce parts of Uzbekistan would benefit from careful
   consideration of the preferences of the target communities and targeting
   of the schemes based on the broad heterogeneities within the
   communities. This will aid in the maintenance of irrigation systems and,
   as a result, increase agricultural production and productivity.},

   Within Pakistan and Tajikistan, engagement with China has enabled the
   utilization of BRI as a political technology for domestic purposes, with
   the attempt to rule, re-define, order and exploit. Put differently, new

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {298-312},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes judicial and police behavior in dealing with cases
   of family violence and divorce in Tajikistan and Azerbaijan. Police and
   judges deliberately violate existing legal provisions to prevent women
   from divorcing or filing charges against their husbands in cases of
   domestic violence. While the law does not recognize religious marriages
   in Tajikistan, judges often rule to protect women's living space after
   the dissolution of such unions. Drawing on rich interview and archival
   data, this behavior is explained by showing that judicial and police
   behavior reflects their biases, which in turn are a reflection of
   majoritarian norms in these countries. Since current laws are derived
   from Soviet codes, which were never internalized by the population,
   police and judges bend them to fit their understanding of social
   justice.},

Title = {Understanding involuntary immobility in the Bartang Valley of Tajikistan
   through the prism of motility},
Journal = {MOBILITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {543-558},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {While in many parts of the urban world the variety of means of transport
   increase, in the rural valleys of Tajikistan, people still have limited
   access to any means of transport. As such, local communities may easily
   get stranded and isolated from food markets and healthcare facilities.
   Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Bartang Valley of the Autonomous
   Kuhistoni-Badakhshon Province of Tajikistan, this paper aims to
   understand how situations of involuntary immobility emerge in the
   region. On the theoretical level, the paper demonstrates the value of
   motility as a conceptual term to explore why people face involuntary
   immobility. In a context of physical remoteness, environmental
   variability and dilapidated infrastructure, new facets of the concept of
   motility are revealed, notably on the ways inhabitants navigate through
   adverse mobility conditions. The paper is articulated around the three
   dimensions of motility: accessibility, mobility skills and appropriation
   of mobility. Results show that most people in Bartang have a low
   motility due to the lack of vehicles, frequent environmental hazards and
   the demanding set of competencies required to be mobile. This low
   motility induces involuntary immobility which is more commonly
   experienced by particular groups but affects most inhabitants when the
   road is closed.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {Studies on the consequences of migration often ignore the perspectives
   of children and adolescents who remain in the origin country while their
   migrant parents are absent. This is the case in Tajikistan, one of the
   poorest and most remittance-dependent countries in the world. Using a
   qualitative methodology, micro-ethnography, we interviewed eight
   teenagers aged between 12 and 18, in the city of Khorugh, Tajikistan, to
   explore the impact of migration from their perspective. Findings reveal
   that these adolescents `understand' the reasons for their parents'
   migration in a way that both gives coherence to this migration and
   invests young people with resilience and coping strategies. As a result,
   all the young people naturalised having to live with sadness, reflecting
   the `normalisation' of this social cost in wider Tajik society. However,
   the experiences and coping strategies of those interviewed are gendered;
   boys were more likely to `rationalise' their experience and be aloof;
   girls more likely to express emotional upset. In practical terms, boys
   also received more benefits from remittances while girls reported
   feeling overwhelmed by domestic chores expected of them. Through this
   study, we contribute to the recent literature on the lived experiences
   and agency of non-migrant teenagers.},

   paper-based and online-based tests were obtained and appropriate
   statistical analysis methods were employed. According to the results,
   students' demographic data (i.e. gender, faculty and major) have
   different effects on their performance, and students performed better in
   online-based tests compared to paper-based tests. Additionally, the
   study aimed to analyze instructor perceptions related to testing types
   that interviews were conducted with 26 instructors of the General
   Physics course. The majority of the instructors indicated that they
   experienced difficulties related to the traditional form of evaluation
   due to the following reasons: lack of time to give personal feedback to
   each student, lack of time for objective evaluation, and difficulty of
   evaluation of crowded student groups. Therefore, they indicated the
   necessity of online test implementation in the context of the General
   Physics course.},

Abstract = {In Kyrgyzstan, nationalism combines a narrative on the titular ethnic
   group and its relation to a civic, state-based, identity, feelings of
   imperiled sovereignty, and a rising electorate agenda for political
   forces. Nationalism has therefore become the engine of an interpretative
   framework for Kyrgyzstan's failures and enables the society indirectly
   to formulate its perception of threat, both on the Uzbek and Kyrgyz
   sides. To this end, this article first analyzes the double identity
   narrative, civic and ethnic, of Akayev's regime, followed by the
   transformation toward a more ethno-centered Kyrgyz patriotism under
   Bakiyev, the growing role of the theme of imperiled sovereignty-which
   culminated with the events in Osh-and how nationalism is today becoming
   a key element of the political agenda and the public scene. (C) 2012

Title = {A cultural comparison study of smartphone adoption in Uzbekistan, South
   Korea and Turkey},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-103},
Abstract = {Smartphone popularity is increasing due to the technological advances
   that mean manufacturers can make more sophisticated devices, and
   telecommunication companies can provide better connections. Gartner
   reported that 403 million smartphones were sold in the fourth quarter of
   2015, a 9.7\% increase over the same period in 2014. It is a common
   perception that users tend to utilise advanced technology to increase
   productivity. However, there are studies indicating quite opposite or
   alternatively slow rates of adoption. To avoid this, companies invest in
   studying consumer behaviour. The purpose of the study is to examine the
   effects of drivers and cultural differences on smartphone acceptance in
   three representative groups from Uzbekistan, South Korea and Turkey.
   Past cross-cultural studies suggest that the main factor differentiating
   the formation of intention among groups would be cultural differences.
   The results showed that cultural differences did indeed play an
   important role in intention formation. The significance of constructs
   affecting behavioural intention varied in each group, and
   collectivism/individualism moderated these relationships. When obtaining
   unified results from UTAUT and the cultural perspective, it is easier to
   compare group behaviours and analyze the differences. This is a good
   guide for managers to consider business activities for each group they
   target.},

Title = {Turkic poetic heritage as symbol and spectacle of identity: observations
   on Turkmenistan's Year of Magtymguly celebrations},
Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {321-336},
Abstract = {This paper presents one case study of state-sponsored cultural
   activities that occurred throughout 2014, Turkmenistan's Year of
   Magtymguly, the 290th anniversary of this Turkmen poet's birth. Such
   activities constitute examples of public culture; they can organize
   representations of a society's past and present to reaffirm for
   participants the values and power structure of their society and
   revalidate its philosophical underpinnings. After examining this Turkic
   poet's iconicity, this paper compiles 2014's celebratory events from
   disparate sources, complementing broader general literature on Central
   Asia's spectacles of public culture and their role in nation-building
   and identity-formation. Rather than merely resulting from any top-down
   decision specifying required activities nationwide, the year's events
   involved numerous synergies as artists, museum and theater
   administrators, composers, and other cultural-sector workers benefited
   by responding to the potential of aligning their work with a theme as
   broad, as widely appreciated, and as eligible for various forms of
   support as this one. In addition, Turkmenistan's strong central
   leadership benefited from this widely shared and highly visible
   celebration, especially emphasizing one element within Magtymguly's
   eighteenth-century vision, an end to his people's tribal conflicts
   within a unified Turkmenistan under one leader.},

Title = {Historical Change and Ecological Risk of Potentially Toxic Elements in
   the Lake Sediments from North Aral Sea, Central Asia},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Aral Sea has received worldwide attention for the deterioration of
   its biological and chemical status. The accumulation of potentially
   toxic elements (PTEs) in the lake sediments reflects changes in the
   surrounding watershed and represents a potential hazard for the lake
   ecosystem. In conjunction with existing environmental records from the
   Aral Sea basin, sedimentary records of PTEs in North Aral Sea covering a
   short time scale, anno Domini (AD) 1950-2018, were used to reveal
   historical changes in PTE concentrations and potential risks to lake
   functioning. The results suggested that the levels of PTEs in lake
   sediments from North Aral Sea changed abruptly around 1970 AD, which is
   concurrent with the intensification of human activities within the
   basin. After 1970 AD, with the exception of As, which remained at
   unpolluted-to-moderately polluted levels, the geo-accumulation indices
   of the remaining PTEs studied (V, Cr, Zn, Co, Pb, Ni, Cu and Cd)
   inferred a moderately polluted status. Before 1970 AD, the total
   ecological risk was low, but since 1970, the total ecological risk index
   has exceeded 150, indicating moderate risk. Historical changes in PTE
   levels of lake sediments from North Aral Sea and their potential
   ecological risks are reported for the first time. The conclusions
   provide an important reference for the protection of lake ecosystems and
   will provide data for regional/global comparisons of environmental
   change during the Anthropocene.},

Title = {A New Method for the Quantitative Assessment of Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) and a Case Study on Central Asia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Regarding the sustainable development goals (SDGs) formulated by the
   United Nations (UN), how to effectively measure, assess and compare the
   progress and trends of these SDGs in different countries was the problem
   we wanted to address. Based on past quantitative assessments, this paper
   proposed a new methodological framework for SDG assessment and analysis,
   and used two typical Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,
   as the sample area to test the framework. Our study chose 209 indicators
   and indicator sets, including 429 specific indicators and collected
   relevant indicator data for the two countries from 2000 to 2017, then
   proposed a new direction for the unification of indicator data as well
   as methods for normalization. Afterward, the scores of each goal and SDG
   performance were calculated. This analysis was also done innovatively
   using the Chow Test to conduct further analysis of the SDG performance.
   According to the assessment, over those 18 years, Kyrgyzstan's SDGs had
   been performing poorly, especially the economic SDGs, while the
   performance of Kazakhstan's SDGs had remained in constant fluctuation.
   It could be said that the SDG performance in Central Asia as a whole was
   not very optimistic. It required the devotion of greater efforts in the
   gathering of different types of indicator data because there were still
   gaps in data collection between countries as well as the missing of
   time-series data, which could challenge the indicator selection and
   further restrict the follow-up assessment and analysis. The assessment
   framework presented in this paper can be applied for assessing the
   long-term performance of national SDGs of different countries, helping
   analyze the internal relationship dynamic among and within countries,
   underscoring specific issues of sustainable development, assessing
   policy and selecting development models and directions.},

Abstract = {The construction industry in Central Asia has shown rapid growth in the
   last decade due to an economic boom, leading to high construction \&

   operations falling behind worldwide best practices. The present study
   first employs a comprehensive environmental screening approach, PESTEL
   analysis, to identify and assess critical external and internal factors
   that can affect C\&DW management in a leading Central Asian construction
   company (headquarters in Kazakhstan, the country with the largest
   economy in the region). Then, a case study is performed using 3R
   (reduce-reuse-recycle) principles and subjecting this company. Current
   international practices tailored to the given context are provided,
   existing company practices and applied improvements are discussed and
   prioritized improvements with implied sustainability benefits are
   proposed. The findings and recommendations are applicable especially to
   other construction companies operating in Central Asia that would ensure
   more sustainable C\&DW management operations in the future.},

Title = {Salt-induced land and water degradation in the Aral Sea basin: A
   challenge to sustainable agriculture in Central Asia},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {134-149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Expansion of irrigated agriculture in the Aral Sea Basin in the second
   half of the twentieth century led to the conversion of vast tracks of
   virgin land into productive agricultural systems resulting in
   significant increases in employment opportunities and income generation.
   The positive effects of the development of irrigated agriculture were
   replete with serious environmental implications. Excessive use of
   irrigation water coupled with inadequate drainage systems has caused
   large-scale land degradation and water quality deterioration in
   downstream parts of the basin, which is fed by two main rivers, the
   Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya. Recent estimates suggest that more than 50\% of
   irrigated soils are salt-affected and/or waterlogged in Central Asia.
   Considering the availability of natural and human resources in the Aral
   Sea Basin as well as the recent research addressing soil and water
   management, there is cause for cautious optimism. Research-based
   interventions that have shown significant promise in addressing this
   impasse include: (1) rehabilitation of abandoned salt-affected lands
   through halophytic plant species; (2) introduction of 35-day-old early
   maturing rice varieties to withstand ambient soil and irrigation water
   salinity; (3) productivity enhancement of high-magnesium soils and water
   resources through calcium-based soil amendments; (4) use of certain tree
   species as biological pumps to lower elevated groundwater levels in
   waterlogged areas; (5) optimal use of fertilizers, particularly those
   supplying nitrogen, to mitigate the adverse effects of soil and
   irrigation water salinity; (6) mulching of furrows under saline
   conditions to reduce evaporation and salinity buildup in the root zone;
   and (7) establishment of multipurpose tree and shrub species for biomass
   and renewable energy production. Because of water withdrawals for
   agriculture from two main transboundary rivers in the Aral Sea Basin,
   there would be a need for policy level interventions conducive for
   enhancing interstate cooperation to transform salt-affected soil and
   saline water resources from an environmental and productivity constraint
   into an economic asset.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long sought to understand when and why the Middle East
   fell behind Europe in its economic development. This article explores
   the importance of historical Muslim trade in explaining urban growth and
   decline in the run-up to the Industrial Revolution. The authors examine
   Eurasian urbanization patterns as a function of distance to Middle
   Eastern trade routes before and after 1500 CE - the turning point in
   European breakthroughs in seafaring, trade and exploration. The results
   suggest that proximity to historical Muslim trade routes was positively
   associated with urbanization in 1200 but not in 1800. These findings
   speak to why Middle Eastern and Central Asian cities - which had long
   benefited from their central location between Europe and Asia - declined
   as Europeans found alternative routes to the East and opened trade
   opportunities in the New World.},

Abstract = {Public infrastructure is one of the important determinants of economic
   growth. Not only access to but also quality of infrastructure affects
   firm productivity as well as people's livelihood. Frequent interruptions
   of the infrastructure-service supply impose extra backup costs on
   enterprises, hinder their timely business activities, and result in
   large losses of sales opportunities. This paper focuses on the impacts
   of improving the quality of public utilities (electricity, water supply,
   and telecommunications), using firm-level data from 26 transition
   economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The results suggest that
   firm costs would significantly increase when electricity outages occur
   frequently and the outage duration becomes longer. Similarly, when more
   time is required to restore suspended water supply, firms'
   competitiveness would be weakened. Not surprisingly, the impacts tend to
   vary depending on industry. The construction, manufacturing, and hotel
   and restaurant sectors are found particularly vulnerable.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The apparent revival of non-consensual bride abduction in Kazakhstan and
   Kyrgyzstan is somewhat surprising seventy years after the Soviet state
   banned the practice and introduced sweeping legislation to emancipate
   women. This article relies on local discourses of shame and tradition to
   explain changing marriage practices and to mark a shift towards greater
   patriarchy in post-Soviet Central Asia. Discourses of shame are
   mobilized by local actors in support of the popular view that a woman
   should `stay' after being abducted. Women can and do resist abductions,
   but they risk dealing with the burden of shame. Further, in Kyrgyzstan,
   where bride abduction is increasingly re-imagined as a national
   tradition, women and activists who challenge this practice can be viewed
   as traitors to their ethnicity. In post-Soviet society, these discourses
   of shame and tradition have helped men assert further control over
   female mobility and female sexuality.},

Title = {Insights into Variations and Potential Long-Range Transport of
   Atmospheric Aerosols from the Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The dramatic shrinkage of the Aral Sea in the past decades has
   inevitably led to an environmental calamity. Existing knowledge on the
   variations and potential transport of atmospheric aerosols from the Aral
   Sea Basin (ASB) is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study
   tried to identify the variations and long-range transport of atmospheric
   aerosols from the ASB in recent years. The Hybrid Single Particle
   Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar
   and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data were used
   to gain new insight into the types, variation and long-range transport
   of atmospheric aerosols from the ASB. The results showed five types of
   tropospheric aerosols and one type of stratospheric aerosol were
   observed over the ASB. Polluted dust and dust were the dominant subtypes
   through the year. Sulfate/other was the only stratospheric aerosol
   detected. The occurrence frequency of aerosols over the ASB showed
   obvious seasonal variation. Maximum occurrence frequency of dust
   appeared in spring (MAM) and that of polluted dust peaked in summer
   (JJA). The monthly occurrence frequency of dust and polluted dust
   exhibited unimodal distribution. Polluted dust and dust were distributed
   over wide ranges from 1 km to 5 km vertically. The multi-year average
   thickness of polluted dust and dust layers was around 1.3 km. Their
   potential long-range transport in different directions mainly impacts
   Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and eastern Iran, and may reach as
   far as the Caucasus region, part of China, Mongolia and Russia.
   Combining aerosol lidar, atmospheric climate models and geochemical
   methods is strongly suggested to gain clarity on the variations and
   long-range transport of atmospheric aerosols from the Aral Sea Basin.},

   based on an analysis of the history of joint Russian and Chinese
   initiatives for economic development to determine the feasibility of
   cooperation in the BRI. Meanwhile, the authors discuss the BRI's impact
   on the economic and foreign policy of the two partners, as well as the
   risks and opportunities for Russia. The article is based on content and
   statistical analysis combined with a historical approach. It concludes
   that Russia and China are actively developing investment cooperation in
   the framework of the BRI, including the Silk Road Fund. The principal
   elements of the partnership involve the economy and processing and
   transporting energy resources. Its objective is to attain both regional

Abstract = {Considerable research in western, low-fertility contexts has examined
   minority-vs.-majority fertility differentials, typically focusing on
   minority groups' cultural idiosyncrasies and on socioeconomic
   disadvantages associated with minority status. However, the formation
   and functioning of ethnic complexities outside the western world often
   diverge from the standard western model and so may their impact on
   fertility preferences, behavior, and outcomes. We expand on the previous
   research by analyzing ethnic variation in completed and desired
   fertility in the multiethnic transitional setting of Kyrgyzstan, where
   ethnic groups and their ethnolinguistic sub-parts are characterized by
   both different stages of the demographic transition and different
   positioning in the socioeconomic and political hierarchies. Using
   combined data from two rounds of a nationally representative survey, we
   find that ethnic-specific levels of completed fertility generally align
   with culturally shaped group-level normative propensities. In contrast,
   in desires to have a(nother) child, the ranking of the ethnic segments
   is more reflective of their collective societal positioning, with more
   disadvantaged segments having lower fertility desires, regardless of
   actual number of children and various other characteristics. We also
   find that ethnic homophily of respondents' social milieu and their
   optimism about the future of their ethnic group are positively
   associated with fertility desires, even though these associations are
   more potently present among women, compared to men. We relate our
   findings to the extant scholarship and reflect on their implications for
   a better understanding of ethno-racial fertility dynamics and
   differentials in transitional contexts.},

Abstract = {Most Chinese overseas energy investments financed by China's development
   banks flow into fossil fuel extraction and coal-fired plants. The carbon
   intensity of Chinese foreign energy investments imposes environmental
   and social costs on host states. Building on the literature related to
   the environmental reform of the World Bank, this article critically
   analyses the carbon-intensive projects backed by China's development
   finance in Central Asia. It shows that China's energy investments in the
   region will face increasing carbon-related regulatory risks. So far, the
   transition towards a more environmentally-driven development policy has
   been limited in China. However, the increasing importance of climate
   regulations in host countries is likely to induce fundamental changes to
   the project-screening process of China's energy development finance.},

Abstract = {On the eve of the twentieth century, plant explorers from the United
   States such as Neils E. Hansen traveled to Russian Central Asia in
   search of new cold-hardy and drought-resistant alfalfa varieties.
   Hansen's travels and the work of other alfalfa boosters would help
   create an alfalfa boom on the American plains, especially in northern
   regions like South Dakota where Hansen worked. However, the effects of
   the growth of alfalfa were not limited to the Dakotas; they were also
   connected to and influenced another boom in the American Southwest.
   Moreover, in order to plant new acreages in alfalfa, huge amounts of
   seed were imported from Russian Central Asia, especially from the region

Abstract = {Beginning in 2002, there has been a gradual expansion in the volume of
   Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) from Turkey to the Less Developed
   Countries in the Global South. However, the pattern of aid flows
   exhibits a curious variation. The Turkish Development Aid Agency (TIKA)
   and Islamic non-governmental organizations (NGOs) systematically work
   together on medical development projects across sub-Saharan Africa, yet
   TIKA's cooperation with Islamic NGOs remains miniscule to none in
   Central Asia. What explains the divergent patterns of state and
   non-state partnership across different regions when providing
   development assistance? The article argues that the regime type and the
   official ideology of the recipient states are critical to understand
   this variation. In seeking to assess the role of rising powers in the
   global politics of development, this comparative study thus highlights
   the role of non-state actors and domestic political dynamics in ODA
   accommodation.},

Abstract = {The paper offers specific inputs to the debate on local content
   promotion in the oil industries of West Africa and Central Asia. To this
   end, we document the international experience with local content
   promotion to derive best practices in the field. We then use a case
   study approach to devise a simple analytical framework for rationalizing
   the selection of viable sectors for local content promotion, in an
   attempt to make operational one of the best practice principles
   (efficiency) developed before. By proposing specific rules regarding the
   acceptability of a project, the analysis seeks to add rigor and address
   distortions on localization outcomes from rent-seeking. The emphasis is
   not on supporting efforts to ``pick winners{''} and subsidize them
   through a range of by and large discredited instruments. Rather, the
   paper focuses on the specific public inputs the government would have to
   provide to support an otherwise market-driven process. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Year = {2007},
Volume = {56},

Abstract = {This paper draws upon experiences in Central Asia with irrigation
   management transfer arising from a development project currently
   underway in the Fergana Valley of Central Asia. One of the main features
   of the project is that it gives much attention to social mobilization in
   order to bring required water management change and get those at the
   grassroots duly organized, educated and empowered to truly self-own and
   manage their community-based organization. The paper, through analysis
   of users' perception before and after the mobilization, documents the
   changes in, attitudes and knowledge of, and the performance of water
   users' associations through, users' perspectives. Though no major
   breakthroughs have been found so far in the quality of irrigation and
   drainage services provided, there are clear indications that increased
   grassroots knowledge and awareness about water and irrigation management
   through intensive mobilization, regular involvement and exposure of the
   entire water user community to WUA management, planning and operation
   matters and decision-making do have a positive bearing on their
   attitudes, behaviours, capacities and skills, adding considerably to
   their overall social capital and thus enhancing their chance for a
   better livelihood. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   on the Uzbekistan Experience},
Journal = {PUBLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Researchers from Uzbekistan are leading the global list of publications
   in predatory journals. The current paper reviews the principles of
   implementation of the ``publish or perish policy{''} in Uzbekistan with
   an overarching aim of detecting the factors that are pushing more and
   more scholars to publish the results of their studies in predatory
   journals. Scientific publications have historically been a cornerstone
   in the development of science. For the past five decades, the quantity
   of publications has become a common indicator for determining academic
   capacity. Governments and institutions are increasingly employing this
   indicator as an important criterion for promotion and recruitment;
   simultaneously, researchers are being awarded Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees
   for the number of articles they publish in scholarly journals. Many
   talented academics have had a pay rise or promotion declined due to a
   short or nonexistent bibliography, which leads to significant pressure
   on academics to publish. The ``publish or perish{''} principle has
   become a trend in academia and the key performance indicator for
   habilitation in Uzbekistan. The present study makes a case for
   re-examining the criteria set by the Supreme Attestation Commission of
   the Republic of Uzbekistan for candidates applying for Ph.D. and D.Sc.
   as well as faculty promotion requirements in the light of current
   evidence for the deteriorating academic performance of scholars.},

   analysis in developing Uzbekistan},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {76-85},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we assess the physical dimensions of Uzbekistan's economy
   during 1992-2011 by using the economy-wide material flow analysis
   (EW-MFA) method, which is an internationally recognized tool for such
   assessments. There have been a number of studies using methodological
   standardization of EW-MFA, but to the best of our knowledge, it has
   never been used to assess the metabolism of Central Asian economies,
   especially, in this case, the Republic of Uzbekistan.
   Our analysis strives to empirically evaluate macroscopic economic
   activities by considering the accounting of material flows. The material
   flows data-set comprises of consistent data for domestic extraction,
   imports, and exports, as well as other derived MFA-based indicators.
   The derived indicators are internationally compared for further
   evaluation of national economic development performance in a given
   period. The indicators of direct material input (DMI) and total material
   requirements (TMR) showed a slight increase in 1992-2011 with an average
   annual increase of 2.79\% and 2.34\%. The trends of TMR, DMI, domestic
   material consumption (DMC) and material efficiency, which is indicated
   by GDP/DMI, displayed lower values than other industrialized countries
   referenced in the international comparison. Although national economic
   performance data showed particularly remarkable success, indicators
   measuring material inputs and DMC reveal an insignificant increase
   during the period of study. During the second decade of study period,
   relative decoupling has occurred which indicated that the economic
   indicator (GDP) grows faster than DMC and other macro indicators grow.

Abstract = {Working toward theorizing Central Asian women's variegated and dynamic
   socio-political activism, in this article, I argue that the contextual
   nature of their activism remains the only viable analytical
   generalization we can make at this time. This activism emerges always in
   a particular existential and relational context presenting a range of
   problems local activists aim to address through the means available to
   them, including discourses on Islam, gender, and justice. I exemplify my
   approach by focusing on several Muslim women activists at different
   levels of Uzbek society, including an individual, communal, and a
   societal ones. Inspired by their interpretations of Islamic duties and
   responsibilities, these women fostered their individual moral
   transformation simultaneously extending it beyond themselves toward
   their local communities and the government.},

Title = {Forced Migrants from Central Asia in Terms of Archival Documents
   (1991-2002): A Case Study of the Chelyabinsk Region},
Journal = {HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST},
Year = {2021},
Number = {3},
Pages = {694-698},
Abstract = {The article draws on the documents from the United State Archive of
   Chelyabinsk Region and the State Archive of the Russian Federation to
   examine forced migration from the former Soviet republics to the South
   Urals in 1991-2002. The choice of chronological framework is due to the
   fact that this period saw the peak of forced migration caused by the
   outflow from the military conflicts zones and due to the difficulties of
   post-socialist transit in the states of Central Asia. The 2002
   Population Census allows the author to draw the balance of these
   processes and to identify the number of the region's residents who
   arrived from the former Soviet Union republics between 1989 and 2002.
   The Chelyabinsk region is a part of the Russian-Kazakh frontier. After
   the collapse of the USSR and the reformatting of state borders, this
   borderland was an extended settlement area of the Russian-speaking
   population, mostly leaning towards moving from Kazakhstan. Due to a
   sufficiently high level of development, transport accessibility and low
   start-up opportunities for migrants, these border regions became one of
   the main places for receiving forced displacements from the Central
   Asian states, mostly Kazakhstan. In the current historiographical
   situation, a holistic reconstruction and detailing of these large-scale
   migrations requires a reliance on new historical sources. Archival
   documents of regional migration services contain valuable data on the
   number of forced migrants, their main areas of origin, socio-demographic
   characteristics, and other important parameters. The documents revealed
   in the fonds of the OGACHO and the GARF have showed that, at the initial
   stage, the backbone of migration flows was the Russian-speaking
   population from neighboring Kazakhstan, able-bodied, with a sufficiently
   high level of skills. This compensated for demographic losses due
   catastrophic growth of mortality and decline in birth rate. Thus,
   according to the migration service of the region, migration compensated
   for more than half of the total population loss, without any significant
   impact on its ethnic composition. At the same time, migrants encountered
   numerous difficulties in integrating into Russian society, which were
   rarely reflected in the specific documentation of state institutions.
   Many of the arrived, for various reasons, were not included in the
   forced migrants and refugees statistics due to numerous bureaucratic
   difficulties and an objective lack of resources for helping such a large
   number of people.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {71},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1734-1755},
Abstract = {Although Islam is described as a fundamental aspect of Kyrgyz national
   identity, its theological aspects are generally elided in nationalist
   discourse. However, as Islam becomes more prominent in Kyrgyz society,
   anxieties about `Arabisation' and the weakening of national traditions
   permeate popular and political discourse. These anxieties operate
   simultaneously in the national and religious registers, suggesting the
   extent to which theological beliefs inform national identity, even in
   secular states. Examining a recent controversy over veiling in
   Kyrgyzstan, this article argues that theology is both linked to
   nationality and also a site of contestation over the terms of
   nationalism itself.},

Abstract = {The Urban Institute (UI) worked with five cities in post-Soviet

   to a proliferation of responsible agencies, lack of rule of law,
   corruption, and passiveness on the part of local governments. UI worked
   with local governments to make an inventory of municipal land, publicize
   the results, and develop a strategy that articulated principles for land
   management and an implementation plan. This led to several improvements
   including proper registration of parcels and proactive policies to lease
   and sell land through open competition. It also established a model for
   determining public policy that countered corruption and public
   deliberation of costs and benefits in the use of local assets. Donor
   involvement to promote good land legislation, the property registration
   system, and decentralization was also critical to success.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Abstract = {Two competing conceptualizations of corruption in the literature view it
   either as efficient or burdensome from firms' perspective. Using data on
   the prevalence and the nature of firms' interactions with tax
   authorities in twenty-eight Eastern European and Central Asian (ECA)
   countries, this paper contributes to evaluation of competing ideas in
   the literature about firms' experience of corruption in tax
   administration. Special emphasis is given to examination of
   taxation-related determinants of corruption prevalence (frequency and
   magnitude of bribery), as well as the effect of the interaction with tax
   authorities on perception of tax and overall corruption. Regardless of
   country context, it appears that perceived corruption in tax
   administration and actual experiences with bribery during interactions
   with tax officials more than anything else affect the overall
   perceptions of corruption, thereby supporting the conceptualization of
   corruption in tax administration as burdensome, rather than efficient.},

Abstract = {The Kemalist leadership of early Republican Turkey attempted to
   transform the country's Muslim populace with a heavy emphasis on
   secularism, scientific rationalism, and nationalism. Several studies
   have examined the effects of this effort, or the ``Turkish
   Revolution,{''} at the central and more recently provincial levels. This
   article uses first-hand accounts and statistical data to carry the
   analysis to the village level. It argues that the Kemalist reforms
   failed to reach rural Turkey, where more than 80 percent of the
   population lived. A comparison with sedentary Soviet Central Asia's
   rural transformation in the same period reveals ideology and the
   availability of resources as the underlying causes of this failure.
   Informed by a Marxist-Leninist emphasis on the necessity of transforming
   the ``substructure{''} for revolutionary change, the Soviet state
   undermined existing authority structures in Central Asia's villages to
   facilitate the introduction of communist ideals among their Muslim
   inhabitants. Turkey's Kemalist leadership, on the other hand, preserved
   existing authority structures in villages and attempted to change
   culture first. However, they lacked and could not create the resources
   to implement this change.},

Abstract = {This chapter focuses on development encounters involving organisations
   with particular Shia genealogies in Pakistan's Hunza-Nagar district and
   Tajikistan's region of Gorno-Badakhshan. Based on anthropological
   fieldwork conducted between 2008 and 2013, I argue for an
   ethnographically grounded exploration of the two regions as contact
   zones which these organisations have entered. I furthermore maintain
   that as a result of dynamics within these contact zones, the analysed
   organisations, while promoting a humanitarian approach to development,
   also become part of specific sectarian imaginaries. Thus this chapter
   attempts to show that these organisations have not only left their
   imprints on physical landscapes and improved people's lives. In the
   course of their involvement, development interventions also become part
   of how society imagines society, and they engage with local
   constructions of sectarian difference.},

Title = {Impact of Institutional Change on Irrigation Management: A Case Study
   from Southern Uzbekistan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The rapidly growing population in Uzbekistan has put massive pressure on
   limited water resources, resulting in frequent water shortages.
   Irrigation is by far the major water use. Improving irrigation water use
   through the institutional change of establishing water consumer
   associations (WCAs) has been identified as a way to increase
   agricultural production and meet the food demand in the area. However,
   most WCAs are not fully able to organize collective action or generate
   sufficient funds to carry out their responsibilities. This study
   investigated the water-resource-related challenges faced by WCAs and
   local farmers in Kashkadarya Province in Uzbekistan, using
   semi-structured expert interviews and focus group discussions. The
   resulting data were analyzed using qualitative analysis software
   (Atlas.ti). The results indicated that outdated infrastructure, poor
   governance, and farmers' non-payment of irrigation service fees hamper
   sustainable water management. Greater trust and communication within the
   WCAs would make an important contribution to effective collective action
   and to the long-term sustainability of local associations.},

   this form of healing, as an imaginal encounter with spirit agents,
   constitutes a particular mode of access to divine knowledge and power
   through which people validate their own particular concepts of Muslim
   selfhood. It explores how the content of these encounters and the
   cosmology invoked by healers are changing in response to the increasing
   influence of scripturalist interpretations of Islam, and how healing

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE ORIENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {643-681},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article examines how a text attributed to the renowned Central
   Asian Sufi figure Aloud Yasavi came to be found within a manuscript
   produced within the Ismaili Shirt community of the Shughnan district of
   the Badakhshan region of Central Asia. The adoption of this text into an
   Ismaili codex suggests an exchange between two disparate Islamic
   religious traditions in Central Asia between which there has hitherto
   been little evidence of contact. Previous scholarship on Ismnli-Sufi
   relations has focused predominately on the literary and intellectual
   engagement between these traditions, while the history of persecution
   experienced by the Ismailis at the hands of Sunni Muslims has largely
   overshadowed discussions of the social relationship between the Isms
   ills and other Muslim communities in Central Asia. I demonstrate that
   this textual exchange provides evidence for a previously unstudied
   social engagement between Ismaili and Sunni communities in Central Asia
   that was facilitated by the rise of the Khanate of Khoqand in the 18th
   century. The mountainous territory of Shughnan, where the manuscript
   under consideration originated, has been typically represented in
   scholarship as isolated prior to the onset of colonial interest in the
   region in the late 19th century. Building upon recent research on the
   impact of early modem globalization on Central Asia, I demonstrate that
   even this remote region was significantly affected by the
   intensification of globalizing processes in the century preceding the
   Russian conquest. Accordingly, I take this textual exchange as a
   starting point for a broader re-evaluation of the Ismaili-Suil
   relationship in Central Asia and of the social `connectivity' of the
   Ismailis and the Badakhshan region within early modem Eurasia.},

Journal = {CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The paper focuses on the question of how young people in the post-Soviet
   country of Kyrgyzstan deal with the structural and cultural demands of a
   society characterized by strong obligations of intergenerational
   solidarity and the normative pattern of submission under the authority
   of elders. Based on three preponderantly qualitative empirical studies
   on kindergarten children, teenagers and young adults, young people's
   commitment to that order is mapped out, defining their reasons for
   acceptance on the one hand and the limits of their acceptance on the
   other hand. Concerning the latter, a special focus is laid on processes
   of the ``self{''} as well as notions of a ``generation gap{''}. We can
   then deduce what the hierarchical age order means for the well-being of
   young people.},

Title = {Developing a copula-based input-output method for analyzing energy-water
   nexus of Tajikistan},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Energy and water are closely related and restricted, which hinder the
   socioeconomic sustainable development associated with resources
   pressure. In this study, a copula-based input-output analysis (CIOA)
   method is developed for analyzing energy-water nexus (EWN) through
   incorporating input-output analysis (IOA), ecological network analysis
   (ENA), and copula within a framework. The CIOA method cannot only
   identify key consumption sectors and system characteristics but also
   build a quantitative EWN dependence structure. CIOA is applied to
   analyzing EWN system of Tajikistan, where 45 scenarios based on
   different water-saving rates and joint probabilities are examined to
   unveil interactions of energy and water. Some major findings are: (i)
   household is the key final demand, in which manufacturing (MAN) is the
   main embodied energy consumer, and food crop planting (FCP) is the main
   embodied water consumer; (ii) the utilization efficiencies of energy
   (35.9 tce/103\$) and water (0.92 m3/\$) are both low; however, the
   circulation and stability of water system are better than those of
   energy system; (iii) energy-water collaborative conservation can be
   realized in FCP, cash crop planting (CCP) and service (SER) sectors,
   especially when the energy-saving rate of SER reaches about 50\%. The
   findings suggest Tajikistan should improve the energy-water utilization
   efficiency and establish a cross-sectoral cooperation management pattern
   for supporting its economic development and resources conservation
   sustainbility.},

Abstract = {Islam, which spread out to Central Asia after its conquest by the Arab
   armies in early 8th century, has expanded and taken roots in the
   spiritual and everyday life of each ethnic group of the region in its
   own way. In its Central Asian geo-cultural contexts, similar to other
   regions where it came to be the faith of majority, it is more prone to
   integrated characteristics, including traditional ethnic beliefs and
   ritualistic elements. The study of Islam among other things in the
   context of local traditional rituals, particularly the funerary
   traditions and observances, which has also kept many cultural elements
   pre-existing the arrival of Islam, has profound meaning in many aspects;
   such as re-interpretation of the afterlife views and development of
   cycle of observances and ceremonies that are performed in the hope of
   earning merit on behalf of deceased and a hope for the day when all who
   died rise again. The focus of this paper is to present the funerary
   ritual cycle of Tajik Muslims. The limits of the contribution are set to
   Tajikistan; but also refer to corresponding and parallel ceremonies
   observed among the Tajiks living in other neighbouring countries. The
   impact of this contribution is both in its inventory of the literature
   on the topic but also on discussion of the importance of these rituals
   and how the communities feel about the reasons and performance of these
   ceremonies. The ceremonies that provide merit for both deceased and
   their kin award them with a sustaining hope that they all will rise and
   unite in the Last Day. The material for this contribution was collected
   through group and individual interviews of people from various regions
   of Tajikistan (April-September, 2014), personal observations and from
   previous studies on the topic. In what follows I will provide a short
   literature review on existing studies on funerary traditions of Tajik
   Muslims and also a descriptive compendium of all currently practiced
   cycles of funerary ceremonies.},

Abstract = {Large parts of Central Asia are characterized by a semiarid to arid
   climate. Therefore, areas close to shallow groundwater, rivers and lakes
   are characterized by unique water-dependent ecosystems and human
   societies which have developed over millennia in close interaction with
   the naturally limited water resources. In the early 21st century, global
   climate change, population growth, river damming, large-scale water
   abstractions and rising levels of pollution exert multiple pressures on
   the region's water resources, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems at
   historically high levels. Water scarcity threatens the livelihood of
   populations locally and in transboundary settings by a growing
   competition over a limited resource. This context is of particular
   importance since all major rivers of the region cross at least one
   international border. The complexity and character of water-related
   challenges in the region mean that management approaches need to be
   integrative, taking into account the natural resource basis,
   environmental limits and the socio-cultural and geopolitical dimension.
   This paper frames the thematic issue of Environmental Earth Sciences and
   provides a comprehensive overview about the current state of knowledge
   about water resources and their management in Central Asia. There is a
   focus on case studies looking at the Selenga-Baikal-Angara Basin, the
   Lake Aral Basin including the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river systems, the

Abstract = {This article explores intersections among gender, violence and
   socio-economic insecurities through examining the practice of women's
   abduction for forced marriage in rural Kyrgyzstan. In the post-Soviet
   period, bride-kidnapping has been discussed as an expression of reviving
   `traditional' ethnic culture and as a system of social rules that
   constrain actors in a variety of ways. Understanding of this practice
   requires a more nuanced analysis of the links between various forms of
   vulnerabilities and gender violence it expresses. Previous work has
   overlooked men's roles within bride abduction process which are not
   simply men's exertion of authority but are intricate reflections of
   wider changes taking place in newly independent Kyrgyzstan. Through an
   analysis of interviews with forty-five men who have been involved in
   bride kidnappings we build a nuanced account of the broader system of
   structural and institutional inequalities that comprise ala kachuu and
   make social actors less agentic. The article links bride-kidnapping to
   ecological \& economic transformations, and the social importance given
   to marriage - all in the context of neofamilial national state politics
   where gender violence takes shape as unsanctioned rituals cast as
   `tradition'.},

Abstract = {The legitimacy of any justice system depends on the belief or perception
   that it operates fairly and without prejudice against any person whose
   interests it serves. Previous research has shown that in the Kyrgyz
   Republic the fair trial rights, for the most part, protected during the
   trial stage of the criminal justice process. The same cannot be said
   when it comes to implementing those rights during the pretrial stages of
   the process. Based on the results of 165 surveys and 10 in-depth
   post-survey interviews of Kyrgyz judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys,
   members of various law enforcement bodies, NGOs, and of the public,
   there is a marked lack of trust in the Kyrgyz criminal justice system
   within the general public and within the system itself. Actual practices
   differ from the internationally recognized standards reflected in the
   country's laws and to a certain degree reflect the legacy of the Soviet
   criminal justice system.},

Abstract = {With the planned US and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014 looming
   ever closer, and Central Asia's own future increasingly in doubt, major
   powers are all competing to enhance their influence in Central Asia.
   2014 may mark a regional tipping point, but none can accurately predict
   how the regional balance might shift after the NATO withdrawal from
   Afghanistan. During 2009-2010, the signs of growing Russian dependence
   on China in terms of economy and energy were palpable, as were the signs
   of China successfully subordinating Russia to its Central Asian economic
   agenda. In 2011-2012, it was difficult to see Russia simply acquiescing
   in its subordination to China without reacting to that situation
   negatively. Since 2011, to avoid this dependence on China, Russia has
   vigorously pushed for its regional integration schemes. 2011 marked the
   launch of the US ``New Silk Road{''} initiative. Great power regional
   integration schemes, however, undermine both regional and national
   development. (C) 2013 The Regents of the University of California.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {706-716},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {This paper analyses complex linkages between gender, nationalism and
   body politics in post-socialist Kyrgyzstan through an exploration of
   social practices centred on female virginity. Drawing on ethnographic
   material, I illustrate how virginity is glorified and fetishised in
   ceremonies and rituals within practices recognised as re-constituted
   national traditions. I problematise such performances for their
   desexualising and dehumanising features and associated physical and
   sexual violence, torture and forced marriage inflicted upon young women.
   It is argued that these controversial practices have gained specific
   political significance after collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and
   have become inherent to the post-independence concept of Kyrgyz
   citizenship. State national identity politics has endorsed
   traditionalising of social norms utilising the rhetoric of restoring
   pre-Soviet authentic Kyrgyz lifestyle. The discourse promoting
   traditional women's features such as chastity, purity and domesticity
   became central to national identity politics and practices emerged to
   uphold these narratives and protect these qualities. Virginity
   ceremonies are one such practice, which by the virtue of its link to
   post-independence concepts of ethnicity, gender identity and national
   identity receive much of their legitimacy.},

Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {254},
Number = {A},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {We scrutinize the impact of household income on energy consumption in
   Uzbekistan. We do so because the evidence on household energy
   consumption in post-socialist transition economies is scarce, while the
   issue is important. We use the unique nationally representative
   ``Uzbekistan, Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey.{''} Our
   cross-sectional analysis shows that electricity, natural gas, and other
   fuels (coal, firewood, animal dung and waste, and liquefied natural gas)
   are equally essential energy sources for households. However, based on
   the budget share Energy Engel Curve, our analysis shows that low and
   high-income households spend a larger share of their budget on
   electricity and natural gas consumption relative to their middle-income
   peers. Interestingly, we find no strong support for the relationship
   between income and the percentage of household income spent on the
   consumption of other fuels. We conjecture that these other fuels became
   a necessity for households to deal with unreliable gas and electricity
   supply. (144 words). 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Hydraulic bureaucracies and Irrigation Management Transfer in
   Uzbekistan: the case of Samarkand Province},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {232-246},
Abstract = {Since the 1990s, Irrigation Management Transfer has been considered the
   world over to be a policy aimed at rolling back state influence in water
   management according to a neo-liberal approach. The initiative was
   endorsed by international organizations as a way of reforming the water
   sector in developing countries. Reflecting on this process, the role of
   hydraulic bureaucracies in driving reforms oriented towards IMT has
   often been neglected in academic debate. This article discusses the
   logic of IMT implementation and the establishment of Water Users'
   Associations (WUAs) in Uzbekistan, specifically in Samarkand province.
   These dynamics have been analysed over the last 10 years showing
   different trajectories within Uzbekistan. Data were collected through
   extensive fieldwork in three districts in Samarkand province. The
   evidence acquired shows that, on the one hand, WUAs were established to
   be a new structure for state control over water and agriculture, in
   conflict with IMT rationale, and, on the other, that WUAs were created
   in the province as a result of a local initiative promoted by the
   hydraulic bureaucracy and accepted by the national authorities due to
   influential power relations.},

Abstract = {Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, there has
   been remarkable enthusiasm for theorising how transitional processes
   have unfolded in post-socialist cities. In seeking to extend literature
   that uses the post-socialist condition as a tool for theory building, we
   draw attention to the ongoing processes of institutional change in
   post-socialist cities. In doing so, we reject a top-down' perspective
   and examine how these institutional transitions are shaped through
   processes of domestication', negotiation and contestation between
   different interest groups in the city. We develop our argument, by
   drawing attention to the local political debates surrounding the
   propiska in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The propiska developed throughout the
   Soviet Union to control internal migration and is still used today in a
   less restrictive form. By discussing our case study, we hope to foster
   attention towards the ongoing contested processes of institutional
   transition in post-socialist cities.},

Title = {Switching the lights off: The impact of energy tariff increases on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {755-769},

Abstract = {This paper describes an analysis of the impact that higher energy
   tariffs would have on households in the Kyrgyz Republic using micro-data
   from the 2009 Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey. This analysis was
   conducted to determine which households would be most affected by higher
   energy tariffs and to what extent mitigation measures, such as lifeline
   tariffs or direct cash transfers, might lessen the impact for poor and
   vulnerable households. The analysis focused on first-order effects and
   used benefit incidence analysis and static micro-simulation to estimate
   the expected costs and benefits of higher energy prices and the
   corresponding mitigation measures. The results suggest that both the
   type of energy and the level of connectedness matter. Increasing tariffs
   for thermal power used for central heating and hot water mainly affects
   richer households in urban areas. Reducing implicit electricity
   subsidies affects the entire population due to nearly complete country
   coverage with electricity connections. Both lifeline tariffs and direct
   cash transfers could mitigate the effect of higher electricity tariffs
   at lower costs than universal subsidies. Journal of Comparative

Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {This article adopts a political economy approach with insights from the
   political geography literature to illuminate how the apparel
   manufacturing sector in Kyrgyzstan has thrived in a region known for
   significant challenges in electricity access and availability. In
   contrast to studies that have analyzed the role of state policies and
   informal relations in promoting industrialization, we focus on how
   myriad shop owners gain access to elite-controlled, privatized urban
   infrastructure through owner-tenant relations in a new market economy.
   Drawing upon original interviews with Bishkek-based shop owners, we find
   that despite the challenges associated working in these spaces,
   including poor infrastructure and exploitative relationships with
   owners, they remain due to the constant provision of electricity and
   convenient location. We contribute to understanding how everyday shop
   owners make sense of and grapple with production challenges in a new
   market context, against the backdrop of Soviet infrastructural legacies
   and post-Soviet privatization processes.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {96},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1259-1267},

Abstract = {The primary objective of an irrigation organization is to provide
   efficient and effective management of water resources to achieve
   enhanced agricultural production. Performance assessment studies provide
   a tool to evaluate and promote this objective. The study examines the
   existing planning procedures and assesses irrigation performance of four
   Water User Associations (WUAs) located in Osh Province, Kyrgyzstan.
   Performance was evaluated using indicators of adequacy, efficiency,
   dependability and equity. Indicators were calculated for each irrigation
   season over the period 2003 to 2007. In general, all WUAs were found to
   be strong in terms of adequacy and efficiency standards. However,
   performance with respect to dependability and equity was poor. The
   results suggest that more effort is needed to improve temporal
   uniformity and equity in water distribution. In order to achieve this,
   estimations of irrigation requirements by WUA managers needs to be
   improved and mechanisms developed to request water in quantities, which
   are needed to maintain equity across the WUA outlets and among water
   users. The study concludes that the establishment of WUAs in Kyrgyzstan
   has helped to address the problem of water distribution and allocation
   among a large number of farmers. However, further training of farmers
   and managers is required to build their capacity to share water and
   ensure equity among users particularly during periods of less than
   optimal water supply. The findings of this research suggest that
   application of a pre-determined set of indicators can be a useful and
   cost effective tool to measure the performance of WUAs. This is
   particularly important for Central Asia where the performance of the
   recently established and state initiated WUAs to replace former
   collective farms is now a key element in future sustainable water
   management. The study identified uncertainties in the estimation of WUA
   water demands based on previous methods and suggests more attention and
   care required in calculating water requirements. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {A resource nationalism policy is a concept that emerged in the 20th
   century, the era of oil and decolonization. The first wave of resource
   nationalism took place in 1930s in Latin American countries. During the
   post World War II period, more and more countries used resource
   nationalism as their main policy tool. Resource nationalism was
   especially actively adopted in countries of Middle East such as Iran,
   Iraq and Kuwait. Adoption of resource nationalism policies resulted in
   the creation of OPEC in 1960s.
   Today the world is experiencing a new wave of resource nationalism. This
   is evident from recent actions of resource-rich countries such as
   Russia, Venezuela and Bolivia.
   Kazakhstan is not an exception as it is becoming one of the major oil
   producers in the world. The situation in Kazakhstan is also stipulated
   by following factor-many of the contracts concluded with International
   Oil Companies in 1990s are perceived as unfair and damaging to national
   interests.
   Since 2000, Kazakhstan has been gradually moving towards a resource
   nationalism policy. However, this article will analyse the most recent
   phase of this policy conducted during 2008-2010. Thus, this research
   article aims to answer the following question: What were the main trends
   of resource nationalism policy in Kazakhstan during 2008-2010?
   The analysis of main novelties in legislation, completed and ongoing
   disputes over giant oil and gas projects and recent cases of subsoil use
   contract cancellation will help a reader find an answer to the question
   stated above.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {350-375},
Abstract = {This paper explores a strange paradox. After the fall of the Soviet
   system, Kazakhstan became strongly incorporated in a world that highly
   values sustainable agriculture and ecologically-friendly pest control.
   In this incorporation process, however, the country abandoned a
   well-established integrated pest management (IPM) system and shifted to
   an exclusive reliance on pesticides. This study analyses the development
   of IPM/ecology-based pest-control approaches in the 1970s and 1980s in
   the USSR, providing some detailed case studies in the Republic of
   Kazakhstan. It examines how these sustainable approaches to pest control
   were replaced by an indiscriminate pesticide use in farming practices
   after independence in 1991. The focus of plant protection research also
   shifted from IPM/ecology-based studies to pesticide testing. The paper
   reveals that the nature of institutional support from the state shapes
   the rise and fall of IPM, particularly since it is crucial for
   addressing the knowledge-intensive character of IPM and governing
   situations in which concerted action is needed.},

Abstract = {This study examines the way the government of Kazakhstan confronted
   informal (squatter) settlements and their property in Almaty in 2006. It
   argues that the way the state handled the issue as part of a broader
   state economic strategy was neither appropriate for the aim of creating
   a functioning property market nor for advancing social justice and
   welfare. The analysis focuses on the attempted demolition of two
   informal settlements, Bakay and Shanyrak, and subsequent events,
   including (a) militant and political responses among the residents and
   their supporters, (b) the legalization campaign, and (c) the effects of
   the global credit crunch on construction and property market in Almaty.
   The goal here is to refine the claim to a connection between formal
   economy, state practice, and squatters' experiences.},

Abstract = {Since its independence, Kazakhstan has adopted a multi-vectorism
   approach to balance between various great powers, especially between
   Russia and China. Despite extensive theorisation of such foreign policy,
   scholarly research has rarely investigated the topic beyond diplomatic
   power dynamics. Based on a systematic search of China's joint projects
   in Kazakhstan in the past 30 years, this paper illuminates several
   unexpected developmental intricacies based on Kazakhstan's
   multi-vectorism, its geo-strategic location, the availability of
   oil-driven sovereign wealth funds, and the public pressure for more
   responsible industrial policies: (1) China's ambition to connect to the
   West has unintentionally amplified Kazakhstan's multi-vector bargaining
   power; (2) Kazakhstan's industrial policies, supported by various
   financial tools backed by its oil-driven sovereign wealth funds, are
   integral to its multi-sector economic development and diversification of
   exports to include more high-value intermediate and consumer goods; and
   (3) shown via a case study on Kazakhstan's agricultural development,
   initial state-level negotiation and sub-national implementation, coupled
   with a mix of Sinophobic and Sinophilic sentiments, have led to a
   nuanced path of economic diversification. Given the authoritarian legacy
   in both China and Kazakhstan, empirical research to compare
   industry-specific development variations would be enlightening for
   developing economies to design optimal paths to leverage China's rising
   dream and capital.},

Abstract = {This article brings together archival and ethnographic research to
   explore the ways that expressive culture and intangible cultural
   heritage flow across national borders, how transnational communities in
   Central Asia engage with discourses and practices of preservation and
   revitalization, and how local heritage initiatives can respond to the
   pressures of economic marginalization, migration, Islamization and
   cultural assimilation. Mashrap gatherings involving music, dancing and
   joking have played a prominent role in modern imaginings of Uyghur
   national identity, and in local processes of community-making. Since
   2009, Uyghurs in Kazakhstan have engaged in new forms of `heritaging'
   mashrap, attempting to revive their role as a medium for strengthening
   communities and sustaining language and culture. We argue that the
   unruly, affective and performative aspects of mashrap are key to the
   success of these social goals, and we highlight their role as a space
   for the negotiation of tensions between religion, nation and hot
   sociality.},

Abstract = {In current conditions, in Kazakhstan and other countries of the
   post-Soviet region, problems of university graduates' employment, as
   well as the complete realization of their professional and personal
   potentials, are becoming increasingly relevant. The transition from a
   planned and centralized economy to a market-based one has also led to
   significant changes in the business. In this paper, the modern economy
   of Kazakhstan is characterized, indicating that uneven distribution of
   inhabitants in rural districts, low level of development of rural areas,
   and specialization of production has created an uneven distribution of
   labor resources, giving rise to unfavorable features of labor markets.
   The paper further presents the results of an empirical study via
   interviewing 1.5 thousand respondents, showing the problems of young
   professionals and imbalances in the modern labor market in Kazakhstan.
   Recommendations are also given for improving youth employment system.},

Abstract = {As Kazakhstan aims to become one of the top 30 developed countries by
   2050, it is increasingly turning to ways which will improve its
   governance, one of which is greater participation by its citizens in the
   decision-making processes of state agencies. A new initiative aimed at
   doing just that, the establishment of public councils, received legal
   backing in January 2016. The aim of public councils is to `strengthen
   democracy and the quality and responsiveness of public polices' through
   the `public expression of matters of concern to Kazakh citizens'. This
   article offers a formative evaluation of the role performed by public
   councils and questions the extent to which they have achieved this aim.
   It draws on primary data from public officials, non-governmental
   organizations, ministries, and non-participant observation of public
   councils in Kazakhstan. It finds limited evidence of their effectiveness
   to date.},

   Kazakhstan with the laws of the USA and Russia makes it possible to
   identify the most practical component used in ensuring the external
   security of these states. As a result, imperfections and peculiar
   conflicts in the laws of Kazakhstan and Russia were revealed. Thus, the
   fundamental laws concerning external and national security require
   certain improvements and changes, in particular, the addition of new
   concepts in external security.},

Abstract = {The paper describes the analysis and assessment of non-profit sector
   development drivers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The authors identify
   the most significant factors that influence the nonprofit sector on the
   basis of multifactor correlation and regression analysis. The scale of
   the non-profit sector is determined on the basis of two indicators: the
   number of non-profit sector institutions and Global Venture Alliance
   (OVA). The authors have estimated two analysis options. The first option
   assesses the effect of the economy on the number of institutions
   (inflation, government expenditures on the social sphere, actual fmal
   consumption) and the effect of the population (employment, income,
   number of socially vulnerable groups). The most significant factors were
   income indicators, their correlation with the minimum subsistence level
   and the number of socially vulnerable groups. The second option
   considered GVA as a resulting indicator and studied the dependence of
   the sector's economic results on its potential, and the sector's state
   support on the population's standard of living and the number of
   socially vulnerable groups. The influence of the state social contract
   does not have a positive effect on the sector's GVA volume, which
   indicates the problem in its priorities and distribution mechanisms. The
   authors proposed a transition to the consumer subsidy model and
   infrastructure support for social entrepreneurship development as one of
   the priority directions of non-profit sector transformation.},

Abstract = {In the conditions of self-isolation, a small and medium business
   suffered as a result of a pandemic, however, large business remained
   afloat due to large ``long money{''}. Large business in Kazakhstan is
   mainly a raw material business, i.e., the mining industry, as a
   priority, has not suspended its activities. The tasks in the field of
   attracting investment remained the same. For Kazakhstan, in the
   direction of attracting foreign investment, firstly, it is worth
   identifying competitive sectors of the economy. Secondly, clearly
   understand the key factors in the development of these industries.
   Thirdly, to conduct a comparative analysis and assess the advantages and
   disadvantages in relation to other countries, which will be the main
   competitors in this industry. Fourth, identify potential investors.
   Fifth, optimize the activities of the coordinating agency or body that
   is responsible for investments in Kazakhstan. For US investors, the
   stock market in Kazakhstan is very small. It presents mainly companies
   in the mining and financial sectors of the economy, as well as the
   public sector. The limited financing opportunities in the stock market
   do not allow providing higher returns on investment funds, and this in
   turn negatively affects the influx of potential investors and investors.},

Abstract = {This research explores the diversity of Islam in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan
   and the implications of that diversity for social-political attitudes.
   Our hypotheses are (1) Kyrgyzstani Muslims can be categorized into
   gender-based religious groupings defined by various religious indicators
   and (2) membership in these groupings influences social-political
   attitudes. Using a 2011 nationwide survey in Kyrgyzstan and applying
   statistical clustering, we identify three groups of religiosity within
   each gender. Looking at four issues such as preferences for Islam in
   politics and for religious versus civil law, we find significant
   differences among the religious groups even after region, urbanity, and
   ethnicity are controlled. These findings suggest that narratives
   treating Muslims as a single, unified community or simply contrasting
   Muslims and non-Muslims need to be expanded to capture meaningful
   variations. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical notion that
   more devout Muslims form a subculture that seeks to extend Islamic
   values into secular realms.},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {140-164},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the impact of the perceived performance
   of the government on subjective well-being based on the individual-level
   survey data of Kazakhstan. Having implemented substantial economic and
   public administration reforms over nearly three decades since
   independence in 1991 Kazakhstan presents an interesting case to explore
   how people perceive the outcomes of the reforms.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper estimates the relationship between life satisfaction and its
   determinants with the ordered logit model making use of the ranking
   information in the response variable.
   Findings
   This paper establishes that satisfaction with public service delivery,
   living conditions and personal and economic factors that are subject to
   public policy, along with trust in government institutions contribute to
   life satisfaction. The more satisfied individuals are with the quality,
   affordability and accessibility of public services, the more satisfied
   they are with their lives as a whole. A higher level of trust in
   government institutions increases individual well-being.
   Originality/value
   There is still a lack of research on subjective well-being in the less
   developed world. This study will help reveal important determinants of
   subjective well-being in the context of a developing country. Also, this
   study is valuable in terms of examining the impact of citizen
   satisfaction with public service delivery on subjective wellbeing based
   on rich individual-level data of the national quality of life (QoL)
   survey.},

Abstract = {Tourism development contributes to economic development. In emerging
   economies like Kazakhstan, tourism development needs active
   entrepreneurship. As the country emerges from the post-Soviet era, there
   has been an increase in economic development and prosperity.
   Entrepreneurship in the tourism sector can drive economies forward
   through the creation of new tourism and hospitality businesses. The
   macroeconomic environment can influence entrepreneurial activity. We use
   an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to examine the impact of
   macroeconomic factors on tourism entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan. Using
   data from 1996 to 2018, we find that there is a positive short-run
   relationship between wages in the tourism sector and entrepreneurship,
   suggesting that wage growth in the sector attracts entrepreneurs. In the
   long run, however, tourism sector wages have a negative relationship
   with entrepreneurship, suggesting that these higher wages represent a
   higher cost to entrepreneurship. There is also a strong positive
   relationship between national income and tourism entrepreneurship in
   Kazakhstan. Implications of macroeconomic policy changes for Kazakhstan
   and other emerging economies are discussed.},

Abstract = {We study police inertia and the depth of public mistrust in, and apathy
   towards, zero tolerance policing (ZTP) in Kazakhstan. Using survey,
   social media and official data we show how ZTP failed: politicians did
   not summon any political will for the policy, the police subverted any
   attempted reforms, while citizens ignored them. The failure of ZTP
   delineates the limits of authoritarian modernisation. We argue that
   modernisers require assistance from citizens in reforming police yet
   cannot mobilise such assistance due to public distrust which itself is
   created by authoritarian modernisers' preference for police loyalty over
   police good behaviour. The consequence is a decoupling of the rhetoric
   from the reality of police reform.},

Abstract = {Recently, the mobile telephony market of Kazakhstan has experienced
   rapid growth to the extent that the number of subscriptions exceeded the
   total population since 2009. In order to understand this phenomenon,
   this paper analyzes the diffusion of mobile telephony in Kazakhstan.
   Estimating the penetration rate of mobile telephony with the three most
   popular diffusion models, Logistic, Gompertz and Bass, it was found that
   the best fit model of the diffusion process for mobile telephony in
   Kazakhstan is Gompertz. Furthermore, we performed an empirical analysis
   to determine the significant factors that affect the fast diffusion
   speed and found that population and fixed line subscriptions are
   significant factors. Finally, we attempted to predict the demand of
   mobile telephony in Kazakhstan over the next ten years using a modified
   Gompertz model in which affecting factors are incorporated. (C) 2016

   In the literature on social embeddedness of the economy, sentiments and

   institutions, which are seen as being instrumental in reducing
   transaction costs and creating social cohesion. By examining the
   transformation of Kyrgyzstan to a market economy, the authors show how

   provides new perspectives on how to view the post-socialist religious
   landscape. By scrutinizing secular responses we show that what is at
   stake is not so much atheist ideology but secular understandings of
   religion that were (inadvertently) promoted by Soviet rule. As such this
   article shows the curious effect of Soviet legacies on contemporary

Abstract = {As a consequence of many independent reports arguing that forced labour
   is being widely used to pick cotton in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Customs
   and Border Protection announced a ban on the import of cotton from
   Turkmenistan on May 18 2018. As a significant textile producer, Turkey
   is one of the primary global trading partners of Turkmenistan which
   includes the products made of cotton, and these products may be exported
   to the U.S. and other Western markets. Turkish foreign investment in the
   Turkmen garment industry is worth analysing because these textile
   factories produce mainly for the international market, not for domestic
   consumption. As Turkish investment in the sector is for export, the
   outputs are expected to be sold in the global market within the supply
   chains of global brands. Therefore, the various international campaigns
   against the country that resulted in corporate decisions to stop
   sourcing Turkmen cotton-have dealt a blow to the economic relationship
   of both countries. This article aims to map the trade relations between
   two countries and summarizing the approaches of social actors in the
   garment industry based on a literature review and interviews with

Title = {The role of risk rationing in rural credit demand and uptake: lessons

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Lack of access to credit is commonly held responsible for slow
   agricultural and rural development in low- and middle-income countries.
   This paper aims to investigate the contribution of demand- and
   supply-side factors, particularly the role of risk rationing, on credit
   application and uptake in the case example of Kyrgyzstan.
   Design/methodology/approach Toward this aim, the study explores the
   determinants of credit behavior of 1,738 Kyrgyz sample farm households
   from 2013 to 2016 waves of the nationally representative ``Life in
   Kyrgyzstan{''} (LIK) dataset along a hierarchical regression model,
   differentiating between factors influencing individual demand for credit
   and factors influencing supply for credit. Findings The results of our
   analysis indicate the relative importance of demand-side factors for
   credit applications, reflecting farmers' perceived risk of credit
   default and loss of collateral. Meanwhile, supply-side factors, such as
   real credit constraints and collateral requests, have a stronger
   influence on credit uptake rates and overall loan sums. These findings
   highlight the role of risk rationing for agricultural investment,
   suggesting a stronger focus of development policy on improving
   risk-sharing mechanisms for farmers, e.g. by developing the agricultural
   insurance sector. Originality/value The paper contributes novel evidence
   on the role of risk rationing in shaping the demand for formal credits
   for increasing agricultural and rural investment in low-income
   transition economies. Previous research has mostly focused on the role
   of credit supply, thus underrating the potential contribution of
   individual risk attitude, risk experience and risk sharing.},

Abstract = {In this article, I investigate the processes of the discursive
   construction of the identity of Kazakhstan as a sovereign and
   non-nuclear state, and show how the construction and performance of
   these identities are both productive and the product of Nuclear Weapons
   Technology (NWT) as a threat to the national security of Kazakhstan. I
   argue that both practices - the production of the state identity and the
   abolition of the ex-Soviet nuclear arsenal from the territory of
   Kazakhstan - are instrumental ways to secure the values of Kazakhstan,
   in this case the existence of Kazakhstan as a sovereign state.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan has a relatively high level of overall gender development, as
   well as of female employment in its energy industries. Diverse views and
   backgrounds are necessary to address the challenges of curbing emissions
   in Kazakhstan, a major fossil fuel producer and exporter. However, our
   analysis of the Labor Force Survey indicates that female representation
   among energy sector managers and overall workforce has been falling over
   time. Moreover, we find that women in Kazakhstan's coal mining,
   petroleum extraction, and power industries are concentrated in
   low-skilled and non-core occupations. Next, by analyzing data on labor
   compensation within energy occupations, we discover signs of persistent
   vertical discrimination, which may reduce incentives for women to
   upgrade their skills. Finally, we find that major shocks, such as the
   COVID-19 pandemic, may stall or reverse prior progress in increasing the
   energy sector's gender diversity. Our findings contribute to raising
   gender awareness among the stakeholders in Kazakhstan's energy sector in
   order to facilitate evidence-based gender mainstreaming.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights problems of religious identity formation in
   Kazakhstan. The authors call attention to the genesis of religious
   tolerance as one of the main factors of the structure of religious
   identity in Kazakhstan. Pre-Islamic cultural layer in combination with
   different religious traditions has made the basis of the worldview with
   some elements of eclecticism and syncretism. Being most viable, Old
   Turkic religious faiths having joined Islam later created a tolerance
   basis of a religious worldview. On the whole, religious identity is a
   symbiosis of spiritual values in a polyconfessional society, where
   historically, Islam and Christianity played an important role. Religious
   identity in Kazakhstan is considered from the point of view of different
   forms of studies. The authors in their research raise the following
   issues: What is religious identity? What is its origin? What is the role
   of religious identity during different historical periods? Has its
   significance changed in the modern society and what are the perspectives
   in the context of ambivalent relations of a state and religion?},

Journal = {GEOFORUM},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Individuals threatened by environmental risks may choose migration as a
   survival or adaptation strategy. However, various factors such as
   attachment to place may encourage immobility despite disaster risks.
   Since the collapse of the USSR, residents of Tajikistan's Pamir
   Mountains have faced significant political and socioeconomic
   difficulties and been exposed to environmental hazards such as floods,
   rockslides, landslides, and avalanches. These hazards put human
   security, infrastructure, food security, and accessibility to
   mountainous areas at risk and call into question aspirations to remain.
   Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Bartang Valley, this article
   addresses immobility in a context of changes and risks. The concept of
   place attachment is used to explore people-place relationships,
   voluntary immobility and in-situ adaptation. Results show that place
   attachment is shaped by cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and
   historical variables and that the relationship between place attachment
   and mobility is complex. The strong place attachment of the Bartangis
   influences immobility aspirations, short-distance displacements, and
   return after international out-migration. Findings suggest a mutually
   reinforcing relation between place attachment, immobility aspirations,
   and adaptive capacity to disasters, which points to a need for more
   attention to voluntary immobility and people-place relationships within
   environmental mobilities research.},

Abstract = {In modern conditions, the competitive advantages of the economy of
   Kazakhstan and the possibility of its modernization, which is
   inextricably linked with innovative activity, are largely determined by
   the accumulated and realized human capital. In a knowledge-based
   economy, the generation of high-quality human capital, necessary for
   sustainable economic, social, cultural and natural development, is
   vital, which requires both research and assessment of the state of human
   capital. The purpose of this study is to analyze the state, dynamics of
   management and development of human capital in Kazakhstan, and also
   presents a methodology for its calculation. The article considers the
   influence of various factors on the human development index using a
   multivariate correlation and regression model, which allows you to
   effectively analyze the available data and predict their value for the
   next period under consideration. A comparative study of the development

   The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that the
   psychological well-being of children was not significantly influenced
   when their parents were not divorced but did live separately. However,
   children with parents who lived abroad and were divorced did show a
   significant increase in their psychological distress when compared to
   children who lived with both parents. Furthermore, children whose father
   was away and who were cared for by their mother only, were more likely
   to experience a lower level of psychological well-being than children
   who lived with both parents. Additionally, no significant effect on the
   well-being of children whose mothers or both parents had migrated was
   found.},

Abstract = {The Jew's harp music effect was examined in the context of observation,

   defined and measured how independent variable (Jew's harp music) acted
   upon the dependent variables (consciousness, emotion, associations,
   imagery) that evoked in the respondent's consciousness. While listening
   to the Jew's harp music (live and recorded), the representatives
   responded through such activities as relaxation, free association,
   story-telling, imagery, and reminiscing. The aim of the study was to
   verify the hypothesis of how strong was the impact of the Jew's harp
   music on the representatives of both cultures. The results of the study
   revealed that all respondents reported about the imageries closely
   connected with their cultural background: history, mentality, culture,
   and identity. BMGIM (Bonny method of Guided Imagery and Music) was the
   main method for revealing pivotal moments of Jew's harp music effect.},

Abstract = {Independent Kyrgyzstan has inherited the Soviet school system, including
   vospitaniye as an essential part. Soviet social policy was driven by the
   belief that building communism partly depended upon the creation of the
   ``Soviet man.{''} Such an individual would demonstrate unwavering
   commitment to aims of the October Revolution, and desire to undertake
   the technological and scientific training required to achieve collective
   purposes. The resulting social cohesion among like-minded individuals
   would thus reinforce the economic and political aims of the USSR. A
   primary institutional location for the creation of such individuals was
   the secondary school, formally organized to achieve two distinct but
   equally important goals: the transmission of formal knowledge
   (obrazovaniye) and the process of social upbringing (vospitaniye). This
   paper first considers the critical nature of vospitaniye as an aim of
   the USSR, an aim typically underestimated in the current discourse of
   reforming post-Soviet schools. It then suggests contemporary dilemmas
   voiced by practicing educators in several Kyrgyz schools who are still
   charged with social upbringing, but in a climate where the ideals and
   values upon which vospitaniye was initially created appear no longer
   viable. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Regents of

Title = {Investigating the Impact of Globalization on Environmental Degradation
   in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {As a consequence of globalization, the world's economies are merging;
   nonetheless, concerns about how globalization trends may harm the
   environment locally and worldwide are growing. The
   globalization-environment nexus has now become a contentious issue among
   policymakers. As a result, several empirical research studies on the
   globalization-environment nexus have been conducted. In the context of
   the environmental Kuznets curve theory, this study explores the
   influence of globalization on environmental deterioration in Kazakhstan
   (EKC). Furthermore, energy is a control variable in this research. Unit
   roots and structural break are used to solve the issue of
   non-stationarity in time series. The autoregressive distributed lagged
   (ARDL) model is used in this research for long run relationships between
   variables as well as to estimate long run and short run coefficients.
   Income, energy, and globalization are discovered to have a long-term
   link. Furthermore, the findings revealed that long-term environmental
   deterioration was exacerbated by economic, political, and social
   globalization, since these factors were shown to have a positive impact
   on carbon emissions in Kazakhstan. Energy is to blame for environmental
   damage both in the short and long term. Furthermore, this research
   reveals that the EKC theory exists in Kazakhstan. On the basis of the
   findings, policy suggestions are made.},

Abstract = {Earlier analyses have demonstrated the loss of industrial worker
   autonomy and the rise of deskilling after production is automated. But
   what happens to autonomy and skill in times of austerity, when
   automation breaks down? Through studying the labour process in a
   Kazakhstani coal processing plant, I explore how the lack of investment
   in machinery and staff influences the way female workers conduct their
   everyday work. Workers are simultaneously reskilled and exhausted by
   invisible extra maintenance work, with their gendered dispositions drawn
   on as a resource. Ethnographies of the economic crisis and austerity
   have so far paid little attention to the transformation of everyday
   industrial work. This ethnography makes a distinctive contribution by
   shifting the focus on to an embodied and detailed analysis of industrial
   work in austerity, developing ideas of gendered maintenance, repair, and
   skill.},

Abstract = {Through the case study of Kyrgyzstan this paper argues that a rapidly
   increasing availability of drugs in prison is not necessarily
   deleterious to solidarity and inmate codes. Instead, the fragmentary
   effect of drugs depends on the forms of prisoner control over drug sale
   and use. In Kyrgyzstan, prisoners co-opted heroin and reorganized its
   distribution and consumption through non-market mechanisms. State
   provision of opioid maintenance therapy incentivized powerful prisoners
   to move to distributing heroin through a mutual aid fund and according
   to need. Collectivist prison accommodation, high levels of prisoner
   mobility and monitoring within and across prisons enabled prisoners to
   enforce informal bans on drug dealing and on gang formation outside of
   traditional hierarchies. We argue that in these conditions prisoners
   organized as consumption-oriented budgetary units rather than
   profit-driven gangs.},

Abstract = {Economic diversification and addressing challenges of non-oil producers
   are a common policy goal in many resource-exporting countries. This
   study's contribution is in drawing policy makers' attention to
   intermediate services, i.e., services used by firms together with other
   inputs in their production process. These services are increasingly
   important for enhancing manufacturing exports and productivity, as well
   as earning direct export revenues. Yet, there is limited research on how
   the intermediate service market performs in countries with large
   extractive industries. To understand complex dynamics between the
   resource and service sectors, we rely on the evidence from Kazakhstan, a
   large petroleum producer. Using panel data analysis, we find that, due
   to the very high service intensity of petroleum production, rising
   petroleum output leads to higher intermediate service prices and lower
   intermediate service output purchased by non-oil producers. To mitigate
   the oil boom's crowding out of non-oil producers from the service
   market, we recommend service sector diversification policies.},

   growth have a strong impact on growth in electricity consumption.
   In the article, the influence of growth of digital technologies use
   which can have bi-directional influence on the energy consumption is
   analyzed. In the long term, the development of digital technologies in
   Kazakhstan reduces the need for electricity through the use of
   energy-saving measures. Digitalization should stimulate the efficiency
   of energy systems by optimizing consumption and metering, reducing

Title = {Toward vegetal political ecology: Kyrgyzstan's walnut-fruit forest and
   the politics of graftability},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As part of their long-running project to get beyond the nature-culture
   dualism, political ecologists have increasingly explored the active
   contributions of nonhumans to environmental politics. Upon decentering
   humans, however, too often posthumanist political ecologies have
   recentered humans and animals, indexing the enlarged category of
   ``political actor{''} to narrowly shared traits like mobility or
   intentionality. Among other consequences, this tendency in political
   ecology's posthumanism leaves the political agency of plants largely
   neglected. Political ecology suffers from this neglect, but the field
   can benefit from an integration of the insights of vegetal politics, a
   literature that traces the consequences of plant capabilities in
   more-than-human geographies. In this article, I model this integration a
   vegetal political ecology by examining human-plant partnerships in
   post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan's walnut-fruit forest, an ecosystem distinguished
   by the number of its trees that can be modified by horticultural
   techniques like grafting. I argue that the forest's ``graftability{''}
   incrementally undermines two different hierarchies, one typifying
   people-plant relationships and another that characterizes state-centered
   regimes of post Soviet forest governance. Graftability thus allows
   Kyrgyzstani villagers and trees to act with more autonomy than they
   otherwise would. This antihierarchical effect is a small biological
   determinism conferred by the capacities of the graftable tree, and it
   has political consequences. Vegetal political ecology aims to similarly
   connect plant performances to their broader political effects; by doing
   so, it can help political ecologists escape the residual humanism that
   still characterizes their efforts at posthumanism and better illuminate
   the political possibilities of partnering with plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Rangeland degradation endangers livelihoods of many rural communities in
   Uzbekistan. Despite the threat of land deterioration from climate
   change, there are many reasons that land users do not take action to
   prevent or reduce land degradation. The described project uses a
   low-cost approach to mobilize stakeholders and initiate collective
   action. Based on a social learning process focusing on development of
   local climate-change scenarios, villagers from Qiziltepa district
   identified adaptation options and agreed on a common purpose to restore
   rangelands through collective governance systems. They formed pastoral
   user groups, established seed isles to ensure seeding of forage shrubs,
   and agreed on seasonal grazing. This case study shows the critical
   importance of scenarios in social learning processes for building
   awareness concerning climate change adaptation; they led to changes in
   perceptions and agreement on collective action and governance. We
   compare the potential of this integrated approach with large-scale
   seeding.},

Abstract = {The study aims to build a model for evaluating the effectiveness of
   activities and the effectiveness of financial investments in high-tech
   industries in Kazakhstan. The development of high-tech industries plays
   an important role in the economic growth of a country. In this regard,
   it is relevant to study the effectiveness of financing the most
   important industry in Kazakhstan. The development of the high-tech
   sector ensures the efficient functioning of the national innovation
   system. High-tech enterprises are one of the competitive sectors that
   allow us to develop and implement leading-edge innovations with the goal
   of their subsequent commercialization domestically and abroad. The
   author defines the multicriteria of efficiency in a knowledge-based
   economy associated with achieving an economic effect with multivariate
   correlation of results with costs. A multivariate dynamic model, an
   integral indicator of performance, an integral indicator of
   cost-effectiveness is proposed. The assessment of the effectiveness of
   financial costs and performance indicators in all regions of Kazakhstan
   have the positive dynamics of indicators, as well as a high economic
   effect. The results of the study can be applied in regional management
   to adequately assess the effectiveness of high-tech organizations and

Pages = {160-166},
Abstract = {In the economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan there still continues
   orientation towards raw materials and dependence on the world raw
   materials markets conjuncture. The key causes of the low level of the
   economy competitiveness are related to the decoupling between science
   and production, insufficient financing of innovation projects, absence
   of the efficient mechanisms of bringing scientific-technical production
   to the level of goods, high capital consumption.
   Renunciation of the raw materials model requires modernization and
   simultaneous transition to the innovation economy, as Kazakhstan relates
   its constant stable growth, first of all, to the transition to the
   innovation way of development. Today Kazakhstan is actively forming a
   new economy which is being built on the present day knowledge and
   competitive innovations. Besides, the purpose of institutional
   transformations is the establishing of the market innovative-active
   subjects. However, till nowadays the program of reduction of home
   economy dependence of on raw materials does not give the expected
   results and until this key problem is left unsolved, it will effect
   negatively economy's development, especially in case of the sharp
   worsening of the environment Unconditionally, there are other domestic
   problems that will prevent from supporting a stable growth.
   Kazakhstan `s transition to the innovation type of development can be
   conditionally divided into two stages. The beginning of the first stage
   is connected with adoption of the Strategy of industrial-innovation
   development in 2003, formation of the institutional base and the key
   moments of the national innovation system. In 2010, having adopted the
   State program of forced industrial-innovation development of the country
   for 2010-2014 there began the stage of accelerated building of the
   innovation economy, strengthening of legislative and financial
   stimulation of the innovation activity.
   At present the efforts of the state innovation policy are aimed to,
   firstly, the development of innovation clusters and innovation
   environment, secondly, the increase of the innovation infrastructure
   efficiency, thirdly, the development of principally new system of
   scientific-technological developments' commercialization.
   Up to 2015 the main priority trends of the state policy on the country's
   forced industrialization will become realization of
   innovation-investment projects in traditional export-oriented sectors of
   economy. The main accent will be made on development of new instruments
   of the state-private partnership in the sphere of innovations
   development, as well as target technological programs for co-funding
   prospective research.
   Within the frames of the article there is shown the state role in
   development and support of the innovation sphere, the accent is made on
   the state regulation of Kazakhstan `s industrial enterprises innovation
   activity.},

Abstract = {Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan have each participated actively in the UN
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences of the
   Parties, and each is developing domestic rules and institutions to
   address UN obligations under the treaties. Russia and Ukraine are each
   Annex I/Annex B countries. Kazakhstan will become Annex I upon
   ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, but has not yet established itself
   as Annex B. Each state has evolved a distinct set of policies and
   priorities in the domestic and the international arena. Drawing largely
   on interviews in each country, this article presents brief histories of
   the evolution of climate policy, focusing on each state's behavior in
   the international arena, the sources of domestic policy leadership, and
   the forces that led to change in each national approach. Current
   policies and practices are evaluated with an eye towards learning from
   the successes and failures in each state. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {A study of inflation persistence in Kazakhstan: what has changed?},
Journal = {MACROECONOMICS AND FINANCE IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES},
Abstract = {The paper analyzes the persistence properties of the monthly inflation
   and its components in Kazakhstan using a fractionally integrated
   approach. The results suggest the presence of long memory behaviour in
   the inflation series. The general inflation, food inflation, and
   non-food inflation experienced a break in late 2015 when the National
   Bank of Kazakhstan announced a shift in the monetary policy regime.
   Non-food inflation is fractionally cointegrated with the nominal
   depreciation rate. The estimates of the Bayesian DSGE model reveal
   shifts in the sources of inflation persistence. The evidence for the
   effect of the policy change on inflation persistence and its sources is
   mixed. Finally, the estimation of the persistence parameter is sensitive
   to the choice of data frequency.},

Title = {Factors Driving Individual Perceptions of Quotidian Corruption: Evidence
   from Kazakhstan},
Journal = {PUBLIC INTEGRITY},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the factors that impact corruption perception at
   individual levels. Based on a survey of 12,010 Kazakhstanis, the study
   investigates people's assessment of corruption in Kazakhstan and their
   attitudes toward government anticorruption policy. The result reveals
   that, on average, the population perceives that a high rate of
   corruption exists in Kazakhstan. Simultaneously, the regression analysis
   shows that there are three main determinants that affect people's
   perception of corruption. First, and most saliently, regional and
   cultural backgrounds do have an impact on people's perception of
   corruption levels. In addition, the study results reveal that among the
   participants' demographic and social qualifiers, the education level has
   considerable influence in driving perceptions. Finally, the findings
   point out that actual experience with corruption play a significant role
   in forming views regarding the overall level of corruption in the
   country.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {178-197},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ethnic return migrations tend to become a controversial issue and create
   public debates within the receiving homeland states because of two major
   factors. The first concerns the economic and social problems brought on
   by the migrants ` integration process as well as the socio-economic
   burden that such migrations place on homeland institutions. The second
   involves the inherently discriminatory and exclusionary character of
   such migrations because they privilege the state-bearing ethnic group
   over others. As we will see, this dynamic has important implications for
   domestic nation-building. To better understand these influences within
   Kazakhstan, this article will attempt to analyse the public debate
   surrounding the government's ethnic return migration policy. It traces
   the discourse concerning the return of Kazakh oralmans (return migrants)
   by examining both Kazakh and Russian language publications. Interviews
   with experts, informal discussions with return migrants and the
   testimonies of long-term residents in the country are also used to this
   end.},

Abstract = {The study aims to identify the main problems of the development of
   innovative entrepreneurship in general and enhance the role of
   entrepreneurial education in Kazakhstan in the context of the
   implementation of the priority state policy of innovative development.
   The purpose of the study was to find out why the reforms of the
   long-term state policy on the development of entrepreneurship did not
   lead to an increase in the innovative potential of entrepreneurs in the
   national innovation system. The study was conducted on the basis of
   questioning and interviewing entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan who introduce
   direct innovations in their activities. In the period from 15 August
   2018 to 15 September 2018, a sociological survey to monitor innovation
   activity at 172 enterprises in Kazakhstan was conducted. The study was
   conducted by random sampling from the general totality of all
   enterprises of the republic. The total amount of the general totality
   was taken as the number of operating small and medium-sized businesses
   (SMEs), as of 1 January 2018, which, according to statistics, was
   1,549,592 units in the republic. It surveyed 172 companies of all
   categories of business, from large to small ones. The questionnaire and
   the interview included a fixed set of questions. Most of the questions
   made it possible to determine the opinion of entrepreneurs regarding the
   current state of development of the business sector in Kazakhstan and
   the main problems that impede the activation of innovations, including
   the lack of competence among business leaders and poor quality of
   preparedness of specialists. The main conclusion that was made by the
   authors within the framework of this mini-study is that the existing
   system of state and institutional support for entrepreneurship in
   Kazakhstan does not meet the modern requirements for building a
   knowledge economy based on effective interaction between the state,
   universities and business. The results of the study are aimed at
   adjusting the state innovation policy of Kazakhstan, in terms of the use
   of more targeted measures to develop innovative entrepreneurship and
   improve the system of business education.},

Abstract = {This study aims is to explore of the theoretical concepts of regional
   imbalances and spatial inequality, analysis of spatial distribution of
   economic growth and identifying of ``growth poles{''} for sustainable
   development in the regions of Kazakhstan. Based on the theoretical
   views, we conclude that the key direction of regional policy is the
   search and development of ``growth poles{''}, which will distribute
   their potential equally to backward regions. The authors propose the
   methodological tools for presenting a standard form of evaluation of
   spatial distribution and inequality of the regions of Kazakhstan. This
   study confirms the importance of using of proposed methods and its
   application for objectively and realistically defines ``growth poles{''}
   for sustainable development. Further, the obtained results showed the
   distribution of Kazakhstan's regions by economic growth and
   specialization with using modified index of KDI. According to the
   results of this theoretical and empirical study proved that distribution
   of the regions of Kazakhstan and results of KDI indexes shows that the
   spatial differentiation of economic development, but its level and
   dynamics are different in different respects. In addition, according to
   the conducted survey, we conclude that one of the most important tasks
   is sustainable growth based on ``growth poles{''} for sustainable
   development.},

Title = {Transmitting competencies at universities in Kazakhstan: intellectual
   capital of teachers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {112-134},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure individual
   intellectual capital (IC) of academic staff as well as to test its
   impact on the employability readiness of future graduates and the
   reduction of the discrepancy between competencies developed and grades
   obtained with the help of two indicators, i.e. intellectual capital
   indicator (ICI) and employability readiness indicator (ERI). While ICI
   measures the level of a teacher's competencies to be transmitted in the
   education process, ERI measures the level of a student's competencies
   developed after completing relevant courses.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is an empirical research carried out
   in the form of a case study. Regression model is applied to find the
   influence of ICI on ERI. The minimisation problem is set with relevant
   constraints to decrease the discrepancy between ERI and traditional
   grade point average (GPA).
   Findings - The data were collected at one Kazakh university and from
   experts from academia and industry by means of documentary analysis,
   specialised tests and structured interviews. The direct impact of ICI on
   ERI is confirmed and the optimal level of ICI that permits an effective
   decrease in the discrepancy between ERI and GPA is identified.
   Research limitations/implications - A longitudinal study covering more
   programmes is necessary to draw conclusions concerning causality. The
   application of ICI as a university's management tool is shown.
   Originality/value - The novelty of this study lies in providing a
   consistent and simple approach for calculating a teacher's IC and its
   impact on a student's employability readiness.},

   currency crises risks. It focuses on the properties of individual
   indicators prior to observed currency crises in Kazakhstan. The
   indicators are used to build composite indicators. An advanced approach
   uses principal components analysis for the construction of composite
   indicators. Furthermore, the common signal approach is improved by
   robust statistical methods. The estimation period reaches from 1997 to
   2007. It is shown that most of the composite indicators are able to flag
   the reported crises in this time span at an early stage. In a second
   step it is checked whether the crisis observed in 2009 is signalled in
   advance.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on an initiative aimed at transforming teachers'
   professional learning in mainstream schools in Kazakhstan through a
   particular approach to the provision of support for teacher leadership.
   It draws on an intervention in four schools in Kazakhstan leading to the
   launch of a three-year strategy to develop support for teacher
   leadership nationwide. Outcomes of the study are accounted for in
   narrative form. The context of the initiative is a post-Soviet country
   striving for modernisation. An intense period of education reform and
   the nature of the education system means that teachers' capacity for
   professional learning is hindered by the organisational structures
   within which they work and the absence of strategies to empower them as
   professionals. The article includes a conceptual exploration which
   considers the role of leadership as a dimension of teachers'
   professionality and the leadership practice of school directors who have
   the potential to create the organisational conditions within which
   teachers can become more agential in the development of their own
   practice. The analysis highlights the importance of the school as a
   learning organisation and the role of support for teacher leadership as
   a tool for the transformation of teachers' professionality and practice
   within their schools.},

Title = {Water security in Uzbekistan: Implication of return waters on the Amu
   Darya water quality},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coal, Scope and Background. Amu Darya river, one of the main water
   resources of Uzbekistan, shows a relevant longitudinal enrichment of
   soluble contents which strongly limits the human uses of its waters.
   Because of the low natural run-off processes, salts and pollutants are
   mainly driven to the river by the return waters used for washing and
   irrigating the surrounding lands. The influence of return waters on
   stream quality is dramatically relevant in the lower reaches of the
   river where almost all the flowing waters have been previously used for
   the agriculture practises. To provide analytical evidence on the
   potential effects of return waters oil the quality of the Amu Darya
   river, the paper reports and comments data on salinity and metals
   contents of the waters flowing in the artificial channel network of
   Bukhara and in the Amu Darya river, from Bukhara Lip to the darn
   forming, the Tuyamuyn Hydro Complex (THC).
   Methods. A total of 15 sampling sites were selected for the analytical
   survey: Two sites were located oil the Amu Darya river downstream from
   the inflow of the return waters from Bukhara, two in the river entering
   in the THC, and three downstream from the darn forming the reservoir
   complex. The waters entering and leaving the Bukhara agricultural area
   were sampled in two main collectors, while the waters flowing in the
   channel system were sampled in six distinct collectors. The following
   parameters were considered in the survey: pH, Oxygen, Hardness,
   Salinity, Conductivity, P-PO43-, P tot, N tot, N-NO32-, N-NO2- COD,
   Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb.
   Results and Discussion. Salt concentrations below 1000 mg/l were
   measured in the Amu Darya waters upstream to Bukhara. In the drainage
   system, salinity exceeds the palatability limit and reaches the maximum
   peak of 3200 mg/I in the outflow collector. Due to dilution effects,
   salinity returns to lower values (400-700 mg/l) along the Amu Darya
   river downstream from Bukhara; calcium and magnesium resulted the major
   constituents of the overall salinity. No serious metal contaminations
   were detected in the waters entering and leaving the examined channel
   system. Differently, the Amu Darya waters upstream to the THC showed a
   relevant metal contamination, with Cr, Ni, Fe concentrations exceeding
   the limits for human consumption. In the downstream sites, located in
   the Tuyamuyn Hydro Complex and in the Amu Darya river flowing out from
   this reservoir, excluding Fe, all the examined metals showed lover
   concentrations and values below the normative limits.
   Conclusion. The direct human consumption of the lower Amu Darya waters
   is strongly limited by salinity and by metal contamination. Although the
   salinity of the return waters from the Bukhara drainage system results
   in above normal limits, no corresponding increases were measured in the
   Amu Darya river downstream from the return water inflow at the rime of
   the Survey. As for the metal contamination of the Amu Darya river, the
   Survey revealed the presence of relevant Sources of metal contamination
   downstream from Bukhara external to the agricultural drainage system.
   This contamination resulted in reduced sedimentation processes taking
   place in the limnetic zones of the Amu Darya river upstream to the dam
   forming the Tuyamuyn Hydro Complex.
   Recommendation and Outlook. To fully understand the longitudinal
   increase of Amu Darya salinity, all evaluation of the Cumulative effects
   of the loads from the main agricultural areas is required, also by using
   mass-balance models. As for the metals, an investigation should be
   addressed to identify the anthropogenic Sources of contaminations
   present in the lower Amu Darya region and the metal loads should be
   diverted.},

Title = {``I Feel Abandoned{''}: Exploring School Principals' Professional
   Development in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER},
Abstract = {The constant challenge of managing uncertainty makes the professional
   development of school principals increasingly important. School
   improvement is unlikely to happen without qualified school leaders who
   continuously work on their professional development. This article
   explores professional development of school principals in Kazakhstan.
   Data were collected through document analysis and semi-structured
   interviews with thirty school principals from public and private
   schools. The outcome of the study indicates that professional
   preparation for school principals is crucial. School leaders do not have
   any induction courses prior to their service and often absorb everything
   as they get immersed by working out what needs to be done in process.
   Furthermore, current professional development programs do not meet the
   needs of school principals. The conclusion includes recommendations to
   improve professional development opportunities for school principals in
   Kazakhstan and a wider community.},

Abstract = {Population growth increases the threat to global food security.
   Kazakhstan, a major agricultural nation, has made significant
   contributions to world food security; however, a wide gap exists between
   its food yield and that of other major crop-producing countries.
   Increasing food productivity in Kazakhstan through enhancing the
   utilization of natural endowments under existing cropland conditions
   would help alleviate global food pressure. Therefore, we elucidated the
   factors restricting Kazakhstan's food productivity and proposed
   reasonable countermeasures. We analyzed the food production structure
   based on yearbooks. Correlation and stepwise regression were conducted
   on crop yield potential factors. The states of Kazakhstan were
   classified by hierarchical cluster and agronomic characteristics were
   evaluated using normalized scores. Wheat (60.3\%), barley (14.9\%), and
   potatoes (16\%) are the main food crops produced in Kazakhstan. The
   ideal regional environment-based geographical crop configuration is
   ``Northern-Wheat, Southern-Barley and Wheat, and Western-Potatoes.{''}
   The key limiting factors of wheat yield are water shortage and soil
   alkalization, while for barley, it is soil alkalization. The current
   planting distribution in Kazakhstan is suboptimal. Water-saving
   irrigation and agricultural runoff, staple crop planting layout
   optimization, organic fertilizer promotion, drought-resistant crop
   variety cultivation, and agricultural technology training must be
   prioritized to overcome crop yield constraints in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze the digital performance of Kazakhstan through
   dynamic analysis of national statistics and international indices as
   Global Innovation Index and ICT Development Index. The research combines
   three stages: analysis of digital transformation policies performance,
   review . of ICT industry development, and comparative analysis of the
   positions of Kazakhstan, Turkey and South Korea as a benchmark in the
   international indices. This research findings show that despite great
   efforts of Kazakhstan in digitalization, the ICT industry contribution
   does not increase, it even falls. The international indices demonstrate
   that the reason is the weakness of the country in skills, venture
   capital, and innovation linkages. This leads to low knowledge,
   technology outputs, mid creative outputs. The enablers of digital and
   overall innovation advancement of economy are identified. According to
   the international rankings the country has been doing its best in Access
   and Use areas. Another enablers are good business environment, ease of
   starting a business, protecting minority investors, and FDI inflows. The
   findings help to draw recommendations for strategic directions in order
   to improve the digital performance in Kazakhstan. The main limitation of
   this study is a lack of dynamic information on positions of Kazakhstan
   in other international indices related to digitalization.},

Journal = {AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE},
Year = {2012},
Number = {2},
Pages = {378-402},
Abstract = {This article examines the new Kazakh nation-state's attempt to provide a
   history to its people and how this attempt functions as a sort of
   ``nomadic nationhood{''}: an ongoing, vibrant process of building both a
   sense of national identity and a sense of historical remembrance that
   center on nomads. The state has taken the lead in this nation-building
   exercise, and Kazakh films, often relying on state support, have also
   played a starring role. Surveying a number of recent Kazakh films, the
   author argues that Kazakh filmmakers, responding to President Nursultan
   Nazarbayev's calls to create national narratives, have turned to nomads
   and the nomadic past as the source for Kazakh nationhood and
   remembrance. The reception among Kazakh citizens has produced a mixed
   bag: many audience members have celebrated what they see as a ``new
   Kazakh patriotism{''} articulated onscreen. Others have criticized
   certain aspects of the onscreen nomadic nationhood, particularly the
   Kazakh state's role in promoting it and Kazakh filmmakers' adaptation of
   Hollywood techniques. Still others have stayed away from Kazakh films
   entirely, choosing instead to check out the latest Hollywood
   blockbusters. As a result, Nazarbayev declared in late 2009 that Kazakh
   filmmakers should start to pay more attention to the present and not
   just the past, but the cinematic nomadic nationhood has not stopped. The
   May 2012 film Myn Bala {[}A Thousand Boys] mines the same historical
   territory as 2005's The Nomad, the film that in many ways initiated the
   new Kazakh cinema's turn to the nomadic past.},

Abstract = {Contemporary dictators routinely co-opt institutions crucial for
   democratic governance. Although an extensive literature examines why and
   how aspiring autocrats bring elections and parties under their control,
   constitutions-and the judicial or quasi-judicial bodies charged with
   interpreting constitutions-are often assumed to reflect the existing
   balance of power. But following regime change, constitutional courts'
   power of review makes them integral for establishing political
   supremacy. We detail how President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan
   captured the Constitutional Court via its transformation into the
   Constitutional Council. The uncertainty and upheaval of the post-Soviet
   collapse created opportunities for formal institutional changes that
   made the court susceptible to executive capture. Nazarbayev subsequently
   used the council rulings to lay claim to democratic and constitutional
   legitimacy in a clear example of authoritarian constitutionalism. To
   trace the process of capture and legitimation, we examine key court
   rulings throughout the president's tenure using a database of
   Constitutional Council decisions.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {113-130},
Abstract = {This article examines the personal papers of Fatima Gabitova, a writer
   and pedagogue who fell victim to Stalinist repression as a ` wife of an
   enemy of the people' in the Kazakh SSR. Gabitova's life was in many ways
   extraordinary, and many of her experiences were hardly typical.
   Nevertheless, her exposure to Kazakhstan's cultural and political elites
   and the rich textual archive she left behind provide a highly nuanced
   window into the lived experience of Stalinism in Kazakhstan. Her
   writings, which include journals, poetry, letters and memoiristic
   essays, reveal a highly articulated sense of self that was informed and
   influenced by the realities of life under Stalinism, but was not
   ultimately determined by the parameters of the Soviet system. Throughout
   her personal writings, Gabitova exhibits a complicated ambivalence
   towards the reality of Soviet rule that demonstrates the broader
   contradictions of Stalinism as a system that was at once repressive and
   participatory.},

Abstract = {The paper proposes a conceptual model to understand female
   entrepreneurial leadership through an exploration of the perceptions and

   paper addresses an existing knowledge gap on entrepreneurial leadership
   by bringing together three key constructs of gender, leadership and
   entrepreneurship. We apply Stewart's model of role
   demands-constraints-choices (DCC) to women entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan
   in order to understand their perceptions of the demands, constraints and
   choices they experience within their leadership roles. The results of
   in-depth interviews with women entrepreneurs present deeper
   conceptualization of their leadership enactment as a co-developing,
   co-constructed relational activity between leaders and others in their
   wider business environments and context.},

Abstract = {This paper examines rates of return to schooling in Kazakhstan using OLS
   (Ordinary Least Squares) and instrumental variable (IV) methodologies.
   We use spouse's education and smoking as instruments. We find that
   spouse's education is a valid instrument and that conventional OLS
   estimates that assume the exogenous nature of schooling, and hence do
   not control for endogeneity bias, may underestimate the true rates of
   return. The results indicate that the returns to schooling in Kazakhstan
   have increased with transition. This may reflect the relative scarcities
   of highly educated people in Kazakhstan with human capital that
   employers require and, following the market reforms, reward accordingly.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan, like other post-Soviet countries, is struggling to address
   residual issues of corruption and weak ethical standards within a wider
   initiative to promote good governance. From 1997 onwards, it has
   introduced several iterations of codes of ethics and professional
   conduct. These efforts have culminated in the appointment of ethics
   commissioners in each ministry and government agency. This article
   considers how effective they have been in enforcing ethical standards
   through primary data collected from three groups: aspiring civil
   servants; in-service officials; and, ethics commissioners. The research
   finds that commissioners have much higher tolerance levels towards
   ethical dilemmas and lack consistency in making judgements, which limits
   confidence in their roles as enforcement officers. IMPACT Ethics
   commissioners have been appointed in Kazakhstan to oversee the
   implementation of an ethics code applicable across the public sector.
   The ethics code is one of several policy instruments being used to
   tackle corruption in several post-Soviet countries. But commissioners
   find themselves in a dilemma. They are employed by the same
   organizations for which they have oversight. To highlight unethical
   behaviour can be viewed as an act of disloyalty. This article therefore
   considers how tolerant commissioners are of unethical conduct relative
   to two peer groups of officials (aspiring civil servants and in-service
   officials), and raises questions as to their independence.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {57-68},
Abstract = {This study continues a series of publications describing the findings of
   excavations at the Karakabak cemetery on the Mangyshlak Peninsula,
   dating to the Hunnic period. Burial 11 was that of a girl dressed in an
   outfit imitating a royal vestment. The reconstructed headdress consisted
   of a cape decorated with round, gold plaques and a diadem-type headband
   of red cloth with mask-shaped plaques. The central forehead plaque is a
   replica of Hellenistic gorgoneia. Similar masks were found in the Volga
   basin and the Northern Black Sea region. Temporal mask-plaques, carved
   of wood and covered with gold foil, have no parallels but follow the
   archaic Scythian tradition. Belt and shoe buckles were not attached to
   belts and were not used in everyday life. In terms of style and
   technique, the gold casing with an embossed geometric design on a wooden
   base belongs to a series of artifacts of the so-called Shipovo horizon.
   The buckle frames are shaped as stylized birds of prey with spread
   wings. The forehead plaque and details of the shoe straps are paralleled
   by those from Altynkazgan. The Karakabak artifacts are unique for the
   Aral-Caspian region, providing yet another indication of close cultural
   ties with the Hunnic world. All details of the outfit were likely
   manufactured at a nearby workshop (the Karakabak settlement) in the
   second ha?fof the 5th or first half of the 6th century for the burial of
   a nomadic noblewoman.},

Abstract = {The article considers the issue of introducing the reference standard of
   ``Smart{''} cities of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The main achievements
   and problems of the ``Smart{''} cities of the Republic of Kazakhstan are
   studied in connection with the introduction of the reference standard.
   Moreover, there were proposed solutions to the mentioned problems
   employing digital territorial marketing tools and were analyzed
   methodical recommendations on the creation of ``Smart{''} cities. The
   directions and indicators of the reference standard of ``Smart{''}
   cities regarding public life were considered, and its main development
   trends were determined. This article provides a rating of introducing
   the reference standard for ``Smart{''} cities of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan for 2019. As the method of study, we chose the method of
   analysis and synthesis, as this is an integral element for the
   fundamental analysis of the introduction of the standard in smart
   cities.
   Using the method of analysis and synthesis, we determined the rating of
   ``Smart{''} cities of the Republic of Kazakhstan, thus we can calculate
   the average percentage of the level of implementation of digitization in
   the areas of public life.
   In connection with a high or low indicator in a certain area of public
   life, the determination of the most effective and attractive directions
   for the implementation of digitization has become possible for the City
   Administration thanks to marketing analysis.},

Abstract = {This article explores the dependence of the agro-industrial products of
   the Republic of Kazakhstan on the development level of rural production,
   social and transport infrastructure. The paper presents main trend of
   the indices of the agribusiness infrastructural development in the
   Republic of Kazakhstan according to the time series based on the
   statistical data of Kazakhstan. The study revealed that the level of
   endowment in social and industrial infrastructure of agriculture in
   Kazakhstan remains extremely unstable. This circumstance can
   consequently form a tendency for a decline and even degradation of the
   Kazakh villages. As a result, it can lead to a violation and decline of
   the reproductive processes in the agribusiness, which, in turn, will
   negatively affect the endowment in products from agricultural raw
   materials. Hence, the formation and development of the agribusiness
   infrastructure is seen as an indispensable condition for the effective
   interaction of the actors of the main and auxiliary production,
   contributing to the development of general prerequisites for the growth
   and development of agricultural products. The results of the research
   can be used by the state in investing social, transport and production
   development of the village to ensure food security. Agricultural
   development of rural areas in Kazakhstan based on improving the
   infrastructure will increase the welfare of rural workers, solve the
   problem of quality food for the population of the country, and take an
   active part in the global task of eradicating hunger on the planet.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of building information modeling (BIM) for building
   sustainability assessment (BSA) is a thriving topic within the
   architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Despite the
   various research approaches to employing BSA with BIM support, the
   research is limited to the BIM implications of BSA methods in developing
   countries. This paper presents how BIM can assist the BSA processes in
   Kazakhstan, using a previously developed building sustainability
   assessment framework for Kazakhstan (KBSAF). This framework has 46
   assessment indicators grouped into nine assessment categories. The
   categories and assessment indicators of KBSAF were derived considering
   the regional variations and country-specific differences in the
   assessment factors. In this paper, BIM functions for BSA were identified
   through literature review; their applicability for KBSAF was evaluated
   by mapping the functions with the assessment indicators of KBSAF and a
   BIM-based BSA framework (BIM-KBSAF) was proposed. The proposed framework
   was validated through a three-round Delphi survey. One of the results
   demonstrates that for KBSAF, BIM can assess 24 out of 46 assessment
   indicators. The proposed framework could serve as a systematic guide to
   the application of BIM for BSA. Furthermore, it can facilitate the BSA
   process and save considerable time and effort.},

Abstract = {As a top trading partner and the foreign investor in Kazakhstan,
   attempting to deepen bilateral relations and review its previous policy
   towards Kazakhstan and the post-Soviet Central Asian region (The
   post-Soviet Central Asian region unites five former Soviet republics:
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) as a
   whole, the European Union is facing up to a new set of internal and
   external conditions which affects its approach to the East. One of the
   crucial determinants taken into account in terms of the European Union
   policy towards its Kazakh partner derives from the more advanced
   processes of Eurasian integration created by the Russian Federation. The
   question is whether the EU will be able to compete or complement the
   consistent steps of the Russian integration project and whether the EU
   should move beyond a trade and investment approach and place emphasis on
   the other strategic areas? The main research objective concentrates on
   the identification and examination of the relationship between political
   decisions and the economic ties of Kazakhstan and its main strategic
   partners. Considering the current geopolitical situation in Ukraine and
   Central Asia, the new `EU-Kazakhstan Enhanced Partnership and
   Cooperation Agreement' will develop more areas targeted at security and
   stabilization issues. However, the top-down initiatives are only the
   legal basis of sectorial cooperation, and the intensification of
   bilateral relations comes from bottom-up cooperation and
   people-to-people contacts.},

   chapter we look specifically at what impact RUK might have on the
   Canadian/North American pulse industry. The chapter covers fairly basic
   questions: where is there potential for pulse markets and where are the
   bottlenecks? It explores production costs, marketing costs and
   structures, policy, trade and market access and future capacity
   projections. Much of this is exploratory; both publically and privately
   available documents were used to fill in the information gaps. The end

Abstract = {Five years ago, Kazakhstan embarked on a dramatic reform of its pension
   and social security system in order to move from an unsustainable public
   defined benefit ({''}solidarity{''}) system to one of defined mandatory
   contributions (accumulative system). While assessment of long-run
   success is premature, early results have exceeded expectations. This
   paper considers the reform's rationale and initial impact: Why did the
   Government of Kazakhstan decide to introduce a new pension system? What
   advantages did the state perceive? Was the Government's decision
   appropriate, and what alternatives existed? The paper also analyzes
   pension reform issues that have yet to be fully resolved.},

Journal = {ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {261-267},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As part of its strategic economic and social plan, Kazakhstan has a
   target of increasing the share of renewables and alternative energy
   sources in power generation to 50\% by 2050. This greatly contrasts with
   the current situation, where around 90\% of electricity is produced from
   fossil fuels. To achieve the target, the introduction of between 600 and
   2000 MW of nuclear power is expected by 2030. This would impact water
   resources, already under stress due to significant losses, heavy
   reliance on irrigation for agriculture, unevenly distributed surface
   water, variations in transboundary inflows, amongst others. This study
   presents an integrated analysis of the water-energy systems in
   Kazakhstan, to investigate the water resource availability to support
   such energy system transition.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate Internet and social networks use
   habits and online risks of children and adolescents between the ages of
   10-19 in the Kyrgyz Republic. Data were collected using questionnaires
   in several government schools in Bishkek during Spring 2018. Totally 316
   children participated in this study. The study employed quantitative
   methods for the analysis of data. As results showed, there are gender
   differences in using the Internet. That is, Kyrgyz boys use the Internet
   for watching videos, and playing games more than Kyrgyz girls. Majority
   of the participants indicated that they preferred to use the Internet
   every day mostly from their private bedrooms of homes. Furthermore, a
   negative linear relationship was found between age and Internet usage.
   This implies that as the age of children increases, Internet usage
   decreases. Results also demonstrated that most frequent applications
   used are WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. While using the Internet and
   social networks, most of the participants indicated that they are using
   smartphones. While participants have basic knowledge about using the
   Internet, most of them lack specific capabilities. Finally, the study
   revealed the Kyrgyz parents' attitudes and perceptions related to the
   Internet and social networks use of children and adolescents.},

Title = {The analysis of water management in Bukhara oasis of Uzbekistan:
   Historical and territorial trends},
Journal = {WATER INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-26},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The limited water resources of and zones are a main constraint on
   economical development. This is especially true for the Aral Sea
   disaster zone. Some 1.2 million people are living in the Bukhara oasis,
   the oldest irrigated zone of Uzbekistan. Irrigation practice in the more
   than 23 0, 000 ha of land consumes more than 5 km(3) of Amu Darya river
   water The future development of irrigated agriculture and the
   environmental situation in the Aral Sea Basin requires analysis of
   current water management in the irrigated areas of Uzbekistan. Until the
   1960s, Bukhara Oasis received water for irrigation from the Zarafshan
   River, which originates in Tajikistan, flows through Tajikistan, three
   provinces of Uzbekistan. The Zarafshan River supplied water around 1.2
   to 1.5 million hectares of irrigated areas of upper located three
   provinces of Uzbekistan and for industrial and communal needs of second
   biggest city of Uzbekistan-Samarqand. Increasing irrigated areas in
   upper and middle reach of Zarafshan River has impacted the water supply
   to Bukhara oasis. In the beginning of 1960s, water shortage in the
   irrigated agriculture of Bukhara Oasis reached its apogee, composing 50
   to 55 percent from annual water requirement. As a solution to the water
   shortage problem of Bukhara oasis, a canal was built from Amu Darya -
   the largest water body of Central Asia. In the beginning of the 1970s,
   canal Amu-Bukhara was finished and Bukhara Oasis began to receive water
   from more reliable source.
   Further development of the irrigated agriculture in Bukhara Oasis from
   1970s fully depended on water supply from Amu-Bukhara canal. The
   irrigated agriculture of the oasis began to receive more water supply
   per unit of land, and some new areas have been developed In the end of
   the 1980s, Bukhara Oasis faced serious water-environmental problems such
   as land salinity and water-logging. The land and water productivity
   declined as an affect of above-mentioned negative impacts of irrigated
   agriculture. The solutions to the water-environmental problems of the
   Bukhara Oasis can be only developed through detailed analysis of the
   past of irrigated agriculture and water management system. This research
   paper describes stages of development of irrigated agriculture and water
   management system Of Bukhara oasis, tries to analyze general trends,
   water use, and management changes in the different stages.},

Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan and Macedonia have experienced a reasonable increase in
   remittances over the last twenty-five years. Subsequently, the extent to
   which remittances can be instrumental for economic development of the
   two countries has gained serious attention in recent development
   dialogues. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of remittances
   versus financial development on the economic growth of the two counties,
   complementing the burgeoning interest and focus on remittances for
   policy. The short-run and the long-run effects and the causality
   dynamics of remittances and financial development, are explored. The
   results show a long-run positive impact of remittances on the economic
   growth of these countries. The impact of financial development is
   negative, significant only for Kyrgyzstan and not statistically
   significant for Macedonia. The causality results show that remittances
   support economic growth for Kyrgyzstan, whereas economic growth appears
   to propel remittances for Macedonia.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-136},
Abstract = {The paper aims to provide a postdictive answer to why Central Asia is
   continuously investing or aspiring to invest in irrigation
   infrastructure and further contributing to the overexploitation of
   renewable and non-renewable endowments of its steppe zones even when the
   conventional economic rationale loses its worth. The study devises its
   analytical framework around the Hungry Steppe case. The analyses explain
   such instances with the sunk-cost effect resulting from complexity
   investments as part of a positive feedback loop that eventually locked
   the Steppe in the intensive cropping system and land degradation. The
   paper justifies the discourse of the sunk cost role in the Hungry Steppe
   lock-in phenomenon using game modelling. The work presents two
   alternative scenarios based on its game-theoretic model. Both scenarios
   reveal that most strategic interactions between the State and resource
   users are subject to multiple equilibria under both bureaucratic and
   private arrangements. Though the private arrangement scenario expects
   better infrastructure, both keep locking the Steppe in the positive
   feedback loop of land degradation and intensive cropping. The paper
   provokes the discourse on alternatives to intensive cropping in the
   Steppe, suggesting the collapse of irrigated agricultural production
   practices to solve the vicious cycle of resource over-exploitation.},

   Central Asia and South Asia: Opportunities for Regional Economic Growth},
Journal = {CHINESE ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Pakistan's geographical location is ideal for China-Pakistan Economic
   Corridor (CPEC) Project, and it formally recognizes as an iconic mode of
   Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan. This corridor is laid at the cross
   intersection of three regions of economic growth include: China, Central
   Asian Republics and South Asia. R plays a vital role of
   inter-connectivity between these three regions, where three billions of
   inhabitants live, which is roughly half of the world population. The
   central argument of the paper is sternly conceptual and based on the
   subsequent arguments: foremost, the foundation of CPEC project is a
   green signal for the regional connectivity, mutual cooperation, economic
   growth and stability of the entire region of South and Central Asia.
   Secondly, the topographical position of Pakistan has an incredible
   potential for corridor development and manipulation process. Thirdly,
   due to the iconic model of belt and road initiative plan, the CPEC
   corridor has broad potential for regional economic growth because of
   shared boundaries and cross intersection position with China, CARs and
   South Asia. Finally, with the copious fruitful opportunities, this
   project facades somber challenges internally and outwardly. Hence, this
   study uses a positive-sum logic to analyze central argument and also
   discusses the policy inputs that may be prolific for regional growth and
   reforms of the project.},

Title = {The new ``Silk Road Economic Belt{''} as a threat to the sustainable
   management of Central Asia's transboundary water resources},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Central Asia is well known for its history of water mismanagement. The
   rapid, catastrophic demise of the Aral Sea is testament to the
   unsustainable water diversion practices introduced by the Soviet Union
   in the 1960s and the failure of the five sovereign nations, Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, that inherited
   responsibility for Central Asia's ailing resources, to develop the types
   of program necessary for the sustainable management of what had become a
   shared ``transboundary{''} water resource. Although nearly 25 years have
   passed since the break-up of the Soviet Union, rivalry and deep mistrust
   between the guardian nations of Central Asia's water resources remains a
   serious impediment to achieving the level of cooperation necessary for
   constructive, water management and decision-making. This is a grave
   concern given the anticipated impacts of climate change and natural
   population growth on water in the region. For many Asians, the recently
   proposed new ``Silk Road Economic Belt' is viewed as an immense
   opportunity to bring wealth and prosperity to some of the poorest
   regions of China and Central Asia. However, given Central Asia's
   appalling record of water management, there is little confidence that
   the project's water needs can be adequately met. In effect, the new
   ``Silk Road Economic Belt{''} and the rapid growth it will bring to the
   region, represents a serious long-term threat to the sustainable
   management of Central Asia's transboundary water resources. The
   fundamental concern is that the project may place too great a burden on
   a water management system in Central Asia that is seriously
   dysfunctional and shows no sign of improvement. Central Asian countries
   need to recognise that the economic success of the ``Silk Road Economic
   Belt{''} hinges on their ability to develop programs that can ensure the
   region's water resources are managed in a sound and sustainable manner.
   This will be a difficult challenge and will require cooperation amongst
   the countries of Central Asia that goes far beyond what currently seems
   possible. Major reforms are necessary and external pressures from
   neighbouring Russia and China are likely required to make this happen.
   It is also essential that the project be supported by sound science and
   good hydrological data, both of which are seriously lacking in the
   region. There will be a need to invest in scientific research in the
   relevant fields. With judicious planning, good science and a commitment
   amongst the nations of Central Asia to create a shared vision and
   collaborate towards a common goal, the ``New Silk Road{''} can be
   developed both beneficially and sustainably.},

Abstract = {The wetlands of the Amudarya River delta in Uzbekistan provide valuable
   ecosystem services to the local human population which has suffered
   severely from the loss of the Aral Sea, desertification and the
   post-soviet socio-economic transition. The region is also particularly
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as a recent severe drought
   has shown. In this contribution, we assess the potential and
   implications of incorporating environmental flows into management of the
   Amudarya River for improving the provision of wetland ecosystem services
   and enhancing resilience of the social-ecological system to river runoff
   uncertainty. Our assessment is based on analyses of 1) the current
   vulnerability of deltaic wetlands to years of low water availability, 2)
   expected regional climate change and its impact on water flows to the
   wetlands, and 3) alternative water use options to enhance environmental
   flows under a changing climate. The results provide a ranking of these
   options with respect to their benefits for the provision of
   environmental flows and implications for agriculture. Their realization,
   however, poses challenges that cannot be tackled by technical
   interventions of redistribution and efficiency increase alone but call
   for institutional changes and moves towards multi-purpose water use. The
   diversification of impacts and livelihood options would allow enhancing
   the resilience of the social-ecological system to climate or
   socio-politically induced changes in water flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of family planning message broadcast on
   radio and TV on the probability of modern contraception utilization in
   post-Soviet Central Asia. Viewing family planning messages on TV
   improves the chances of using modern contraception for a woman who
   actually saw the messages by about 11 and 8 per cent in Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan, respectively. If every woman in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
   had an opportunity to watch a family planning message on TV, then the
   likelihood of using modern contraception would have improved by 10 and 7
   per cent in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, respectively. By contrast, the
   effect of hearing family planning messages on radio is not significant

Abstract = {Security cooperation has increasingly come to prominence in the realm of
   relations between the European Union (EU) and China as a policy area
   primed for fostering deeper bilateral strategic convergence. Where
   leaders on both sides have talked up security cooperation particularly
   by pointing to recent successes (on counter-piracy, Iran), EU-China
   scholars have largely qualified these as exceptions to the rule. The
   rule being that the gulf between Brussels and Beijing continues to be
   too wide on norms, geopolitics and trust for them to live up to their
   ambitious rhetoric on security cooperation. Taking this into
   consideration, this paper sets out to examine whether the Belt-and-Road
   Initiative (BRI) - given its magnitude and high stakes - can change the
   dynamics of bilateral security cooperation. Looking at this through the
   lens of three distinct theories applicable to the study of EU-China
   relations, it would appear that even bilateral security overlap
   pertaining to the BRI cannot reverse these deeply entrenched behavioural
   patterns.},

Abstract = {This paper tells the story of trade-off between hydropower and

   trade-off has become a transboundary issue. Efforts to coordinate
   bilateral action using integrated water resources management (IWRM)
   principles of basin-wide cooperation have not yet yielded the hoped for
   results. This paper shows that there could be a `second best' option of
   solving at least part of this transboundary problem by `banking' winter
   flows released for hydropower production in Kyrgyzstan in the
   underground aquifers of Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley and extracting it
   for irrigation in the summer months.},

   penetration of Salafism; (c) securitization of ``non-official{''} Islam
   by state and non-state actors and (d) the rise of conservative Islam
   which goes hand in hand with retraditionalization. These factors, in
   their turn, pose serious challenges to developing inclusive society and
   human rights in Central Asian countries. This paper argues that the
   Islamic revival in Central Asian countries has come to the point when it
   can be analyzed under the prism, whether it impedes the development of

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, China's participation in Central Asia's
   energy sector has increased dramatically. This article explores the case
   study of China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in Central
   Asia's natural resource sector through the framework of bargaining
   model. Although the scholarly literature studied extensively FDI
   determinants and support of the home government on MNE activities
   abroad, there is little evidence-based research on the effect of
   governmental negotiations on OFDI. The existing research on China's OFDI
   in natural resource sector highlighted the country's complex approach to
   energy deals, which was facilitated by investment in infrastructure
   projects and provision of loans. As this study confirmed, support with
   loans and investment in the development of export pipeline
   infrastructure was crucial in securing energy deals for Chinese
   multinationals (CMNEs). More specifically, this article makes an
   important contribution toward the understanding of China's investment in
   developing markets with high levels of political risk such as Central
   Asian region. The presented evidence suggests that there is a positive
   correlation between home government support and successful entry of
   CMNEs to natural resource sectors in emerging markets.},

Abstract = {The article examines the current foreign trade relations between the EU
   and Central Asia. Based on econometric analysis, it sets out possible
   perspectives for the further development of mutual trade relations in
   the time of geoeconomic changes. As one of the most important
   integration groupings in the world, the EU has a significant influence
   in promoting its foreign trade interests. Central Asia is a part of Asia
   consisting of several states that are members of different regional
   integration groupings with different priorities. The result of the
   research is an analysis of mutual foreign trade relations. Character and
   perspective of mutual trade relations is assessed by using of selected
   one-factor indicators (trade complementarity index and trade intensity
   index). With the help of time-series forecast model, the article also
   tries to estimate the future development of EU exports as well as EU
   imports in relation to Central Asian countries. While the EU imports
   from Central Asian countries are dominated by minerals and fuels in the
   long term, EU exports consist of more sophisticated and diversified
   production. This represents the potential for further development of the
   business relationships and growth of mutual trade. In the case of
   favourable circumstances, a continuing growth trend in trade can be
   expected, especially on the side on EU exports.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to elucidate the influence of inflow water on the
   salinity concentration process of a saline lake and the mass balance of
   Lake Issyk-Kul, a tectonic saltwater lake in Kyrgyzstan. Based on the
   survey results and meteorological data from 2012 to 2015, we analyzed
   the dissolved chemical composition loads due to water inflow. Then, we
   discussed the relationship between the increase in salinity and water
   inflow into the lake. Through the water quality analysis data, we used
   the tank model to estimate the river inflow and analyze the loads by the
   L-Q curve. The groundwater loads were then estimated from the average
   annual increase in salinity of the lake over a period of 30 a. The
   results suggest that Lake Issyk-Kul was temporarily freshened between
   about AD 1500 and 1800 when an outflowing river existed, and thereafter,
   it became a closed lake in AD 1800 and continued to remain a saline lake
   until present. The chemical components that cause salinization are
   supplied from the rivers and groundwater in the catchment area, and when
   they flow into the lake, Ca2+, HCO3- and Mg2+ precipitate as CaCO3 and
   MgCO3. These compounds were confirmed to have been left on the lakeshore
   as evaporite. The model analysis showed that 1.67 mg/L of Ca2+ and Mg2+
   supplied from rivers and groundwater are precipitated as evaporite and
   in other forms per year. On the other hand, salinity continues to remain
   in the lake water at a rate of 27.5 mg/L per year. These are the main
   causes of increased salinity in Lake Issyk-Kul. Since Na+ and Cl- are
   considered to be derived from geothermal water, they will continue to
   flow in regardless of the effects of human activities. Therefore, as
   long as these components are accumulated in Lake Issyk-Kul as a closed
   lake, the salinity will continue to increase in the future.},

   path-dependent effects on the manner in which government resources are

Title = {The Legacy of Conflict: Reconstruction and Migration in the Aftermath of
   Civil War in Tajikistan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW},
Abstract = {How do civil war and subsequent reconstruction efforts affect
   international migration? Although a wealth of evidence points to violent
   conflict's effects on contemporaneous migration and although a rich body
   of literature examines development's effects on migration, we know less
   about the intersection of conflict, development, and migration. This
   article examines the intersection of these factors nearly a decade after
   the 1992-1997 civil war in Tajikistan, combining data from the 2007
   Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program,
   and original interviews. In a series of logistic regression models, I
   show that conflict fatalities do not have a direct effect on subsequent
   migration, while the number of years a district has had a development
   resource center directly increases the likelihood of migrating. However,
   the interaction between development and conflict is negative and
   significant. These findings suggest that conflict's legacy does not
   directly impact the likelihood of respondents migrating but instead
   changes the nature of the relationship between development and
   migration. This finding illuminates conflict's potential long-term
   consequences for migration and extends the migration-development nexus
   by addressing the role of conflict in the relationship between
   development and migration. In particular, it suggests that migration
   research in conflict-affected countries should incorporate measures of
   both conflict and development, even after a given conflict has ended.},

Title = {The effect of irrigation service delivery and training in agronomy on
   crop choice in Tajikistan},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {175-184},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of irrigation delivery
   services and agricultural extension services on crop choice in southern
   Tajikistan. This analysis is motivated by the government's recent
   efforts to address the country's severe malnutrition problem by
   supporting changes in irrigation service delivery and agronomy to
   increase diversity in agricultural production and consumption, in an
   environment where the cultivation of cotton had, until recently, been
   mandatory. Water management in Tajikistan has largely been transferred
   to the community through the creation of water users' associations
   (WUAs), which were established between 2011 and 2013. While all WUAs
   received training to improve irrigation delivery services, some also
   received training in cultivating alternative crops and improving
   cultivation practices through agricultural extension services. Through
   specific empirical analysis conducted on a primary panel dataset of 1855
   farms in southern Tajikistan, we identify the extent to which
   improvements in irrigation services, and agronomy training through
   extension services affect decisions pertaining to cultivated areas of
   cotton and wheat (the traditional crops) and the cultivated area and
   number of (newer) high-value crops. We also examine the effect of water
   delivery and agricultural extension services on crop diversity and
   cropping intensity (how often land is used in a calendar year). We find
   that improvements in irrigation delivery services affect cultivated
   areas of cotton and wheat. Cultivation of high value crops is
   significantly influenced by agricultural extension services. While
   cropping intensity depends on water delivery services, crop diversity
   depends on extension services. From a policy perspective, these results
   highlight the importance of agricultural programs for stimulating
   agricultural value added in landscapes historically characterized by
   limited crop choice and a collapse of the agricultural sector.},

   version to compare the performance of loans-plus-savings MFIs with that
   of lending-only in a sample of 710 observations from Eastern Europe and
   Central Asia. Owing to our unique capital structure data, we control for
   the use of subsidized capital, which related work ignores while existing
   evidence points to tradeoffs between subsidies and savings. We find that
   financial performance and breadth of outreach are positively associated
   with savings mobilization, while the evidence on depth of outreach

Abstract = {Central Asia is emerging as an important pole of global economic and
   political power, thanks to its unique location at the heart of Eurasia
   and its abundance in energy reserves. This study explores the social
   power change in Central Asia from the perspective of cross-border
   mergers and acquisitions (M\&A) by using the social network method. The
   main results are as follows: (1) The complexity of the energy M\&A
   network has significantly decreased after the financial crisis in 2008.
   In the meantime, energy M\&A became an important way to enhance energy
   power for buyer countries. Betweenness centrality is becoming the most
   significant factor affecting energy power, yet the effect of out-degree
   is weakening. (2) The community underwent multifaceted restructuring,
   which reflected the shift of energy power in Central Asia. Kazakhstan is
   the most powerful country in the energy sector in Central Asia. In
   addition, East Asian countries/regions, represented by China, are
   actively enhancing their energy power. (3) Different M\&A modes reflect
   various M\&A motivations of countries in the energy sector. In the
   future, more efforts should be made to promote the establishment of a
   pragmatic and efficient multilateral energy cooperation mechanism and
   strength the cooperation of the economy and energy finance when China
   participates in the energy market in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the new approach studying variations in city size
   and the impact that the Silk Road had on the structure of cities,
   demonstrated through the study of economic aspects of the Bukhara oasis.
   We use archaeological data, compare the ancient economy to modern ones,
   use modern economic theory and methods to understand ancient society,
   and use what we have learned about the ancient economy to understand
   modern economies better. In sum, we explore the past through the present
   and the latter through the former. Our main finding is the generation of
   models able to answer to the city-size distribution in different
   territories, comparing them between the past and the present. This study
   first revealed that, through Zipf's Law, we found similarities between
   modern post-Industrial Revolution and medieval economics. Secondly, we
   also found that in ancient times the structure of the city was linked
   with the local economic demand. We have demonstrated this through the
   study of cities along the Silk Road.},

Abstract = {Ever-growing business challenges emphasize the necessity for
   organizations to develop a competent workforce to achieve more stable
   and inclusive growth. Therefore, this study explored the ever-growing
   interest in expatriate workers to support organizational
   competitiveness. This study focuses on Uzbekistan, as its growing
   competitiveness is pressurizing leader-follower dyads and organizational
   innovation capabilities to improve productivity, reduce costs, and
   become more profitable. Workplace environments can be sensitive towards
   leadership behaviours that can adversely affect expatriates' readiness
   for innovation. Therefore, this research study addressed the gap in
   empirical evidence within the leadership literature relevant to the
   interplay between toxic leadership and expatriates' readiness for
   innovation. This qualitative descriptive study employed an explorative
   phenomenological cross-sectional design (n=10) into expatriates'
   real-life experiences to understand the effects of toxic leadership on
   their readiness for innovation. The findings from the phenomenological
   study suggest that toxic leadership can adversely affect expatriate's

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {112},

Abstract = {Fluctuations in the volume and the value of financial remittances
   received from abroad affect the livelihood of households in developing
   economies across the world. Yet, political scientists have little to say
   about how changes in remittances, as opposed to the receipt of
   remittance payments alone, affect recipients' political attitudes.
   Relying on a unique four-wave panel study of Kyrgyz citizens between
   2010-2013 and a cross-sectional sample of 28 countries in Central
   Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, we show that when people
   experience a decrease (increase) in remittances, they become less (more)
   satisfied about their household economic situation and misattribute
   responsibility to the incumbent at home. Our findings advance the
   literature on the political consequences of remittance payments and
   suggest that far from exclusively being an international risk-sharing
   mechanism for developing countries, remittances can also drive
   fluctuations in incumbent approval and compromise rudimentary
   accountability mechanisms in the developing world.},

Abstract = {This paper examines university-industry partnerships (UIPs) in
   Kazakhstan. The study described here explored the kinds of
   collaborations with industry that universities have undertaken, their
   purposes and benefits, and the contextual barriers to such partnerships.
   Our findings suggest that UIPs in Kazakhstan remain weak and are largely
   limited to employers' involvement in teaching, the provision of
   internships for students, and technical consultancies. We argue that the
   goal of policy makers to develop robust research partnerships that
   contribute to innovation and economic growth is constrained by heavy
   faculty teaching loads, poor institutional support for research,
   constant reforms in the higher education system, and little consistency
   in the priorities of the fast-changing Ministers of Education.},

Abstract = {The digitalization is strategic priorities of development in all around
   a world. According to the leading world experts, by 2020 a quarter of
   the world economy will be digital, and implementation of the digital
   technologies in economy allowing the state, business, and society to
   interact effectively. Development of the human resources will create a
   new generation of patriots with excellent ICT skills. This program is
   one of the strategic directions of Digital Kazakhstan economy
   development. Governments can play an essential role in enhancing digital
   literacy through the country's primary education system. Digital
   literacy skills lead to stronger creativity, self-expression and
   improved interpersonal relations, and provide a foundation for the
   responsible use of technologies.
   Some of the main barriers to broadband ICT development are the high
   prices of the Internet, the lack of an enabling policy environment, high
   costs of infrastructure, low revenue potential and low digital literacy
   rates.
   Today a considerable number of people uses the Internet, origin and
   promoting of social networks generally erased age and frontiers of the
   virtual communication of people. Social communities are one of the most
   exciting services existing on a network today. One of the successfully
   implementable tasks of social networks is the combining of users on
   shared interests. Another task is filling with a network various
   information. For teachers, the social networks are the set of
   opportunities discussion of current problems of education, for example,
   implementation of new State standard teaching programs, representation
   in networks of own methodical development, creative pupils works and
   also the experience exchange. There is a massive number of different
   judgments whether it is worth ``retracting{''} generally once again
   children in the virtual communication. The modern IT technologies
   provide the whole list of tools for communications of teachers with
   pupils not only in school hours but also behind walls of schools. Abroad
   mobile means of communications with a class through the program on the
   smartphone or a pad - pretty favorite thing. The Black Board and Canvas
   services, known in the USA, integrate schools and campuses. The closest
   to them in essence and to contents the School student mobile application
   which serves as a site for combining of schoolmates together with their
   class teacher. Education of children of a primary school age develops on
   an electronic network model more and more active today. Implementation
   in introductory classes of the computer, mobile devices, and software
   applications transfers ordinary handling real objects to the virtual
   graphics space, and internal communication - in remote interaction

Abstract = {Central Asia is one of the regions with the highest probability of
   conflicts over water. Kazakhstan is the main Central Asian economic
   power and therefore it is important to understand how the country's
   water management policy is influencing water availability in the other
   Central Asian states. Already, the Central Asian economies are
   developing under increasing water deficiency, resulting in developmental
   problems. The main reasons for this are increasing political tensions
   and worsening ecological and socio-economic conditions. Kazakhstan was
   the first country in Central Asia to develop the pre-requisites for a
   transition towards integrated water resources management (IWRM).
   Therefore, Kazakhstan has potential to lead the development of
   transboundary water integration between all Central Asian states. A
   scenario for successful regional cooperation on water management in
   Central Asia involves establishing legal mechanisms for water management
   following international water law, assistance by international agencies
   and donors, and integrated social, economic and environmental
   methodology.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether and to what extent new member states of

   goals towards Central Asia through the EU rather than bilaterally. To do
   so, it focuses on Latvia and Romania. While the article finds evidence
   of Romanian attempts to project its interests in the region onto the EU
   level, Latvia appears to rely more extensively on the EU level to pursue
   its goals towards Central Asia. Using insights from the literature on
   Europeanization of national foreign policy, the article explains this
   finding with reference to four variables that determine whether a member
   state will seek to upload its national foreign policy preferences onto
   the EU level, namely the perceived salience of the policy goals, the
   extent to which member states can carve out a niche, their perceived
   capabilities and the level of Europeanization of their national foreign

Title = {Examining the determinants of energy-related carbon emissions in Central

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Central Asia is a major emerging energy player but is also affected by
   global climate change. To both maintain its economic growth and cope
   with climate change, Central Asia is in urgent need of environmental and
   sustainable energy strategies, as well as effective carbon emissions
   mitigation. To this end, we investigated the characteristics of
   country-level total carbon emissions in Central Asia (i.e., Kazakhstan,
   Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan). Then, the
   logarithmic mean Divisia index method was applied to identify and
   quantify the driving forces behind the changes in carbon emissions. In
   addition, country-level long-run relationships between economic growth
   and carbon emissions were tested by means of the environmental Kuznets
   curve hypothesis. The results are as follows. (1) There were pronounced
   differences in per capita gross domestic product, energy intensity, and
   carbon emissions structures across this region, mainly owing to the oil
   and gas endowment and economic development stage. (2) Impacts and
   influences of various drivers of carbon emissions varied across
   countries over the different stages. (3) During the economic recession
   period, carbon emissions decreases were largely driven by the decreasing
   economic growth effect associated with political instability. (4) During
   the economic transition periods, economic growth effect played a
   dominant positive role in accelerating carbon emissions in the five
   countries, followed by the population scale effect. Energy intensity
   effect was the most important factor in curbing carbon emissions in the
   five countries. Emissions increases during these periods were partly or
   largely compensated by the improving energy intensity in the different
   countries. Carbon intensity effect mostly had a negative but relatively
   minor effect on carbon emissions. (5) There was only an inverted
   U-shaped curve existing in the lower-middle-income country (Uzbekistan).
   Considering these differences and disparities in emissions
   characteristics and determinants can provide important insights for the
   energy sustainability and carbon mitigation in Central Asia.},

Title = {Evaluation and analysis of ecological security in arid areas of Central
   Asia based on the emergy ecological footprint (EEF) model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {235},
Pages = {664-677},

Abstract = {Though well-positioned geographically to benefit from China's Silk Road
   Economic Belt initiative, Central Asia nevertheless suffers from a
   fragile ecological environment. Therefore, it is crucially important for
   the five Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
   Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to achieve sustainable development of their
   respective social economies and ecological environments through the
   evaluation of their ecological security. This paper applies the modified
   emergy ecological footprint (EEF) model to optimize the traditional
   ecological footprint model by analyzing and evaluating the ecological
   security of Central Asia during the time frame of 1992-2014. The paper
   will also use the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model
   to forecast changes which might occur during 2020-2025. The results
   indicate that the EEF mainly decreased from 1992 to 1998 but then
   gradually increased from 1999 onwards, with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan
   showing the largest change rates of 3.93\% and 2.77\%, respectively,
   from 1999 to 2014. The highest EEF occurred in Turkmenistan (20.27
   hm(2)/cap), followed by Kazakhstan (19.19 hm(2)/cap), with Tajikistan
   registering the lowest (2.96 hm(2)/cap). In Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and
   Uzbekistan, fossil energy consumption footprints contributed the most to
   total EEFs, at 38.34\%, 57.06\% and 46.52\%, respectively, while
   grassland (51.52\%) and building land (50.49\%) contributed the most to
   Kyrgyzstan's and Tajikistan's total EEFs, respectively. The emergy
   ecological carrying capacity (EEC) largely decreased in all five Central
   Asian countries, with the largest decrease occurring in Turkmenistan at
   annual average change rates of -1.93\%. The highest EEC was in
   Kazakhstan (30.36 hm(2)/cap), followed by Turkmenistan (15.85
   hm(2)/cap), while the lowest occurred in Uzbekistan (2.86 hm(2)/cap).
   Additionally, during the period under study, the ecological surpluses
   and deficits in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
   Uzbekistan were 11.18, 2.21, 2.04, -4.42 and -7.57 hm(2)/cap,
   respectively, with the largest ecological deficit occurring in
   Uzbekistan. There was also a persistent rise in ecological pressure in
   all five countries, especially in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
   Furthermore, the ARIMA model forecasts that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan will change from ecological surpluses to ecological deficits
   from 2020 onwards, and that the ecological pressure grades for these
   countries will rise to level 3 (relatively unsafe). Turkmenistan and
   Uzbekistan are forecast to be at level 1 (at risk). The significance of
   this research is optimizing the ecological footprint model and applying
   it in Central Asia for the first time. The work also quantitatively
   investigates Central Asia's ecological footprint and ecological carrying
   capacity on both a national and regional basis and evaluates the
   ecological security of each country. Overall, this research not only
   provides guidance for decision-makers to develop sustainable strategies
   in Central Asia, but also serves as a scientific reference for other
   arid regions to pursue ecological security and sustainable development.

Abstract = {The overarching goal of agricultural sciences is to optimize production
   technology to rationalize the use of production resources, energy, and
   space. Due to its high fertilization and water requirements, the vine is
   a plant with a high potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
   modifying factor in the production technology is plantation management.
   To reach the assumed goal, a field experiment was conducted in the years
   2001-2020, and the following training systems were used: multi-arm fan
   system (A) trunk height < 30 cm, (B) 80 cm, (C) 120 cm, one-side
   multi-arm, paired planting (D) 120 cm, (E) 140 cm. The total amount of
   GHGs emitted in vine cultivation was calculated according to ISO 14040
   and ISO 14044 standards. The system boundaries were: establishing the
   plantation, the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, energy
   consumption for agricultural treatments, and gas emissions from the
   soil. The amount of GHG emissions for cultivation using the systems A,
   B, C ranged from 426.77 to 556.34 kg of CO2-eq Mg of yield(-1), while in
   the case of D and E systems, the value was approx. 304.37 to 306.23
   CO2-eq Mg of yield(-1). When comparing this stage with total annual
   emissions related to cultivation (for 1 ha), the amount of emitted GHGs
   at this stage is from approx. 42\% to 58\% higher than from annual
   emission related to cultivation. Concrete poles are the main element
   related with GHG emission during stage of plantation establishment, from
   97 to 98\% of emission. In the case of annual production, nitrogen
   fertilizers are responsible for approx. 36\%. Moreover, the results show
   that systems D and E increased the average annual fruit yield (per 19
   years of research) by approx. 68\% compared to the A, B, C systems.
   There was no difference in the yield of plants with different height of
   shoots in the D and E systems. The ``one-side, multi-arm, paired
   planting system `` was characterized by the highest production and
   environmental efficiency.</p>},

Abstract = {This article analyzes discursive strategies of China and Japan to
   integrate newly emerging Central Asian (CA) states into their internal
   and external policies, norms and concepts, according to which they
   justify both their actions in CA and CA responses to these policies.
   This article elaborates the concept that to a certain extent, the
   interests of China and Japan in CA are similarly focused on mineral
   resources and political stability. However, these countries employ
   different discursive strategies to frame their approaches and goals.
   This article also emphasizes that the discourse of competition for
   regional domination prevalent in the English language, Russian and some
   CA media is largely an imposition of a zero-sum vision of international
   relations that is not proven by any empirical evidence. On the contrary,
   many of the projects conducted both by China and Japan are compatible -
   if not supplementary - and do not necessarily imply exclusivity of
   interest. At the same time, both China and Japan have different ways of
   reasoning their CA engagements, resulting in a rivalry of discourses for
   the `hearts and minds' of the CA population.},

Title = {Agricultural Water Use and Trade in Uzbekistan: Situation and Potential
   Impacts of Market Liberalization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-63},
Abstract = {The focus in Uzbekistan on cotton and its irrigation led to large
   increases in water use with significant downstream impacts, particularly
   on the Aral Sea. While agriculture is still heavily influenced by the
   state, Uzbekistan has become more integrated in the global economy since
   its independence. The major goal of this paper is to examine the
   interrelationship between agricultural policies and water use during the
   last 15 years and how moves towards freer markets, such as those which
   might occur under the World Trade Organization, may impact Uzbekistan's
   water resources in the future. The results show that partial or full
   market liberalization may result in an increase in water use. However,
   the greater message is that non-water policies can have a major impact
   on water outcomes and therefore should be considered in any discussions
   of water sector reform.},

Journal = {WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {337-348},
Abstract = {Like many irrigation schemes in Central Asia, the one in Khorezm faces a
   two-fold challenge: on the one side, the severe problems inherited from
   the past need to be remedied and on the other side, the rising
   supply-demand gap driven by sharpening competition for water and climate
   change must be dealt with. Located in the lower part of the Amu Darya
   basin, Khorezm irrigation and drainage scheme is particularly vulnerable
   to supply-demand gaps. Promising solutions towards adaptation comprise
   modified strategies of land and water use towards higher efficiency and
   flexibility in combination with measures to lessen the constraints of
   the system itself, which was initially designed for the management of a
   few, large and uniform production units and not for many diverse and
   small units. Solutions consist of flexible, modeling-based approaches,
   re-arranging institutional settings and establishing economic incentive
   systems. Flexible modeling allows an integrated use of surface and
   groundwater resources avoiding or minimizing the impact of water stress
   on yield. Institutional settings strengthen the position of water users
   via improved participation and transparency of processes in Water
   Consumers Associations (WCAs). Economic measures support sustainable
   resource use strategies and improve the functioning of WCAs. The
   findings could be extrapolated to other regions of Central Asia with
   similar conditions and challenges.},

Title = {Spatial planning as policy integration: The need for an evolutionary
   perspective. Lessons from Uzbekistan},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {179-186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We start out from the premise of a continued need for policy integration
   to address both economic and environmental issues in society, arguing
   that spatial planning is a privileged site to locate such endeavor.
   While policy integration in planning can acquire many forms, we
   understand those forms as ways to manage interdependencies between
   organizations. Spatial planning can contribute to the integration of
   policies in comprehensive visions, but a planning system, in the sense
   of a network of organizations, does not escape from the evolutionary
   rigidity introduced by interdependence and path-dependence. In a study
   of the evolutionary path of spatial governance in Uzbekistan, a former
   Soviet republic, we investigated the shifting patterns of policy
   integration that affected the organization of space. Policy integration
   in planning, it is found, is path-dependent, worked out positively and
   negatively, and necessarily relied on informal coordination mechanisms.
   Thus, a planning system striving to manage interdependence has to be
   highly reflexive, to understand the extent to which its transformation
   options are constrained by history and by present linkages between
   organizations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Rethinking energy security and services in practice: National
   vulnerability and three energy pathways in Tajikistan},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {39-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To help answer questions about availability, accessibility,
   sustainability and other dimensions of energy security, the
   vulnerability approach concentrates the attention of policymakers on the
   assessment of risks associated with natural, technical, political and
   economic factors. This understanding, combined with a focus on energy
   services (e.g. lighting, heating, telecommunications, mobility, etc.)
   helps to prioritize actions to achieve the goal of energy security. This
   paper conceptualizes energy security as low vulnerability of vital
   energy systems and sustained provision of modern energy services. Taking
   Tajikistan as a case, this paper highlights key vulnerabilities
   including neglect of environmental conditions, insufficient energy
   production capacity, unreliable and expensive energy imports, dwindling
   power infrastructure causing technical and economic losses, inadequate
   transparency in the power sector, lack of regional cooperation in energy
   and water resources sharing, and inadequate financial resources to
   address these challenges. Three major proposals presented by the World
   Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Government of
   Tajikistan to achieve energy security in Tajikistan are evaluated.
   Specifically, they lack a focus on energy services and therefore
   overlook people's socio-cultural context and appropriate energy needs.
   This paper highlights energy services as critical to people's wellbeing
   and socioeconomic development.},

Title = {Soft budgets and elastic debt: farm liabilities in the agrarian

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1360-1381},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Since Tajikistan's independence, market reforms and pressure from
   international donors have brought changes to the state's role in the
   economy. The official narrative holds that the post-socialist state
   reduced its control over agriculture, but there are still various
   mechanisms through which it exerts control over farming. In this paper,
   I examine Tajikistan's post-socialist agrarian change through the prism
   of farm debt. Farm debt used to be an accounting nuisance in Soviet
   agriculture as a result of so-called soft-budget constraints. In the
   political economy of post-socialist transformation, farm cotton debt has
   been transformed into indebted land. I classify this debt `elastic' for
   its ambiguous nature. It ties farmers to land and makes farmers'
   independence illusory. With an in-depth analysis based on original
   ethnographic insights, I aim to provide a theoretical contribution to
   the way in which debt is conceptualised and politicised in post-Soviet
   Tajikistan.},

Title = {Gender and the academic profession in contemporary Tajikistan:
   challenges and opportunities expressed by women who remain},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-262},
Abstract = {This article attempts to describe the deleterious impact of higher
   educational changes affecting female faculty members working in Tajik
   universities in the post-Soviet era. Over the past two decades, the
   social and economic position women gained during Soviet times has
   significantly eroded, bringing enormous challenges to education and
   higher education access, completion and staffing. The demographic and
   cultural marginalization of women here has negatively impacted
   university teaching opportunities and the status of women faculty
   members. Ethnographic interviews - along with relevant secondary data
   reveal that despite various official gender-equity policies announced by
   the state, female participation issues remain prominent in the
   university. Our interviewees also report continued difficulty entering
   higher faculty ranks and leadership positions in university. However,
   significant numbers of women are still to be found there, and they
   report a workable compromise between being professional educators and
   trying to navigate a local culture that is becoming more `traditional'.},

Title = {Securitization of Higher Education Expansion in Authoritarian States:
   Uzbekistan's Seemingly ``Elite{''} Tertiary System},
Journal = {PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM},
Abstract = {While many states move from elite to mass higher education (HE) systems,
   little is known as to why some authoritarian developing states resist
   this transition. In post-Soviet Uzbekistan the tertiary system was
   consciously restricted to cover roughly 10\% of the population; a
   situation that continued for more than two decades. This paper argues
   that it is the securitization of the role of HE growth that confronts
   the transition of HE from elite to mass systems. To support this
   argument, the paper analyses Uzbekistan's HE policy and the notorious
   1992 student protests that legitimized the securitization of HE
   expansion in the country.},

Abstract = {Institutional design for water governance assumes the possibility of
   intentional introduction of policy innovations into the new contexts or
   amending existing institutions. Such institutional design has been
   common in the water sector and examples include participatory irrigation
   management, integrated water resources management plans and water
   privatization programmes. With increasing application of institutional
   design across various political, socio-economic and cultural settings,
   the importance of the context is increasingly accepted. The key question
   is therefore how to reconcile institutional design and contextual
   variability. Based on our research on the introduction of water user
   associations in parts of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, we conclude
   that a top-down institutional design implemented nation-wide and not
   involving multiple stakeholders and engaging their views, is doomed to
   failure. As an alternative, we offer interactive institutional design,
   which is based on collaborative approaches to institutional design and
   treats design as works of assemblage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   because some households have zero consumption on a budget line in the

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},

Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {882-900},
Abstract = {How do authoritarian rulers legitimate repressive actions against their
   own citizens? Although most research depicts repression and legitimation
   as opposed strategies of political rule, justified coercion against some
   groups may generate legitimacy in the eyes of other parts of the
   population. Building upon this suggested link between legitimation and
   repression, this article studies the justifications of mass killings. To
   this end, framing theory is combined with recent research on the
   domestic and international dimensions of authoritarian rule. We contend
   that frames are directed towards specific audiences at home and abroad.
   Moreover, given the common threats at the global level and the diffusion
   of repressive tactics, we assume that learning processes influence
   discursive justifications of repression in authoritarian regimes. We
   provide an analysis of government rhetoric by comparing the protest
   crackdowns of Rabi'a Adawiya Square in Egypt and Fergana Valley in
   Uzbekistan, taking into account the audiences and the sources of the
   frames that justify repression. In both cases, we find the terrorism
   frame to emerge as dominant.},

   mainly relied on the reviewed literature, but have also made use of
   expert interviews conducted by the authors during 2011-2016 in
   Uzbekistan. Our results indicate that Uzbek policymakers have learned
   much from the unanticipated and undesired consequences of earlier
   irrigation reforms, as their perceptions and beliefs have changed and
   developed over time. Yet, although policymakers' beliefs have been
   fostered by a newly emergent Integrated Water Resources Management
   approach - which has become a central, globally promoted paradigm - the
   beliefs and institutions inherited from the Soviet era, as well as
   informal practices in irrigation-water use, have also been acting to
   constrain the choices of politicians and economic entrepreneurs.},

Abstract = {In examining the relationship between the War on Terror and restrictions
   on civil society, Uzbekistan is an important case, given its emergence
   as a key player in the operations in Afghanistan, its own terrorist
   threat, and its particularly stringent policy towards civil society.
   This article argues that while the `crackdown' on civil society has
   followed a similar pattern to that of other countries where civil
   society is perceived as harbouring a threat, there has been a
   significant shift since the War on Terror began as to the perceived
   nature of the threat. At the time of 9/11, the government of Uzbekistan
   took Islamic terrorism to be the main threat; yet within the space of
   just over two years a new threat was perceived. Western support for
   civil society, a concession made to the US-led coalition in return for
   support against Islamic terrorism, emerged as an even greater threat to
   the regime. It is this perceived threat that has primarily driven state
   policy towards civil society, raising important questions about how
   democracy promotion can be best taken forward in the post-9/11 world.},

Abstract = {This article examines religious legislation reform in Uzbekistan since
   2017, when President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took power after the death of
   his predecessor Islam Karimov. The article evaluates to what extent the
   reforms that the Uzbek government has been trying to implement in recent
   years are advancing religious freedom in Uzbekistan, and to what extent
   they are helpful in developing covenantal pluralism. The article argues
   that Uzbekistan has made some progress in furthering freedom of religion
   or belief for all, thereby improving prospects for covenantal pluralism.
   However, there are still serious obstacles preventing believers, and
   especially religious minorities, from full enjoyment of freedom of
   religion and liberty of conscience.},

Abstract = {We develop an analytical framework that allows to grasp the evolving
   patterns of rules and roles in rural transitions, and the concomitant
   changes in the functions of expertise. Institutional change is
   understood as governed by a combination of path dependence,
   interdependence and goal dependence. We illustrate and develop the
   framework by means of an in-depth analysis of rural transition in the
   Khorezm province, Uzbekistan. In Khorezm, the Soviet actors were tightly
   coupled in order to contribute to shared goals first of all cotton and
   grain production. After independence, dissolution of collective farms, a
   diminished interest in planning and policy coordination, and locally
   different styles of political steering, led to a much less coordinated
   rural governance, to a scattering of expertise and to opacity regarding
   its supply and demand. We reflect on the implications of our findings
   for the analysis of rural transitions more broadly, and especially the
   impact of policies and plans aiming at a rural transition in a specific
   direction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {In this article we analyse the dynamics of marriage and childbearing in
   Uzbekistan through the prism of the recent socioeconomic and political
   history of that country. After becoming an independent nation in 1991,
   Uzbekistan abandoned the Soviet modernization project and aspired to set
   out on a radically different course of economic, social, and political
   development. We argue, however, that not only independence but also the
   preceding period of perestroika reforms (1985-91) had a dramatic effect
   on social conditions and practices and, consequently, the demographic
   behaviour of the country's population. Using data from the 1996
   Uzbekistan Demographic and Health Survey we apply event-history analysis
   to examine changes in the timing of entry into first marriage, first and
   second births over four periods: two periods of pre-perestroika
   socialism, the perestroika years, and the period since independence. We
   investigate the factors that influenced the timing of these events in
   each of the four periods among Uzbeks, the country's eponymous and
   largest ethnic group, and among Uzbekistan's urban population. In
   general, our results point to a dialectic combination of continuity and
   change in Uzbekistan's recent demographic trends, which reflect the
   complex and contradictory nature of broader societal transformations in
   that and other parts of the former Soviet Union.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Within Western societies, the detrimental consequences of mass
   consumption on the environment have long been identified. Consumers have
   developed sustainability consciousness in accordance with research and
   policies. In non-Western societies, however, experiences with mass
   consumption have not been so long standing. Furthermore, the extent of
   mass consumerism is not as wide ranging as in many of the richer
   countries in the world. In central Asian countries, a soviet history
   adds to this the concept of resource depletion and sustainability
   impacting industrialization as an ideological taboo. Currently, central
   Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan are embarking on enacting
   sustainability policies. Kyrgyz consumers are also developing
   sustainability awareness. This awareness sometimes leads to either new
   practices or changes in existing practices. However, consumption
   practices are too complex to assume that only consciousness will lead to
   increasingly sustainable practices. Furthermore, there is no control
   over the content of such awareness. The case of emergent sustainable
   consumption in Kyrgyzstan demonstrates how sustainability values become
   integrated with locally existing knowledge, meanings and material
   circumstances. The intent of this study is to investigate how Kyrgyz
   consumers perceive sustainable consumption and whether and how they
   integrate sustainability awareness into practices and with other values.
   Our data consist of 50 structured interviews that were conducted during
   the summer of 2013 in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. Closed questions
   were analysed employing descriptive statistics, whereas a qualitative
   content analysis was applied to the results of open questions. The
   results provide an insight into the way in which emerging sustainability
   awareness is able to develop and how such awareness becomes integrated
   into existing practices and values.},

Abstract = {This article describes various opportunities but also constraints to
   greater crop diversification, and the impact on local sustainability in
   the Khorezm province of Uzbekistan in the Aral Sea basin. At present,
   approximately 70\% of the area in this study region is sown to irrigated
   cotton and winter wheat under the so-called state mandate. We present
   evidence of the benefits of moving away from this approach toward more
   diversified farming with an increasing area of alternative crops in the
   selected region. We report on a series of studies that included a) crop
   suitability screening based on secondary data, b) joint farmer
   experiments, and c) a mathematical simulation model with the overarching
   objective to assess potential benefits and constraints for crop
   diversification. The findings of this long-term, multiyear, and
   multidisciplinary approach show that greater crop diversity can increase
   water use efficiency, and secure farm income in dryland areas prone to
   water scarcity and soil salinity. In addition, the findings of the
   simulation model confirmed that crop diversification could secure income
   of downstream farmers during the climate-driven decline in water
   availability. Overall, the findings indicate that greater crop diversity
   and improved access to markets can lead to a sustainable development
   path in the region.},

Abstract = {This article draws from the expanding field of climate mobilities, which
   explores the nexus between climate change, environmental conditions and
   (im)mobility based on the `mobilities paradigm'. Environmental hazards
   collide with transportation infrastructures, for instance through the
   adverse effects of floods, heat waves, and ice thawing on roads, and may
   for instance disrupt or hamper everyday mobility. Frequent
   disaster-induced mobility impairments may render individuals unable to
   commute between places and decrease their socioeconomic opportunities.
   Emphasising the material aspects of mobilities, this paper argues that
   an analysis of mobility systems helps to develop a deeper understanding
   of (im)mobility inequalities and injustices in the context of
   environmental risk and climate change. Sheller's mobility justice
   perspective is taken as a way to critically address mobility disruptions
   and to reflect on the interconnection of different (im)mobility
   patterns. Empirically, the paper draws on a case-study of Tajikistan's
   Bartang Valley, where disaster-induced mobility impairments reduce the
   residents' capacities to circulate and access food markets, healthcare
   facilities, and job opportunities. Overall, the paper is an invitation
   for the fields of environmental and climate mobilities to consider the
   impacts of environmental conditions on infrastructures, matter, and
   things that enable or hamper human (im)mobility.},

   far tended to focus on Central and Eastern Europe. It does this by
   describing the nature of post-Soviet trends in nuptiality and fertility
   in Tajikistan, the republic with the highest rate of population growth
   during the Soviet period. It finds evidence for a decrease in period
   fertility after independence: initially, through a decline at higher
   orders; then, through a significant decrease in the rate of first
   births, associated with a dramatic decrease in the rate of first union
   formation since the mid-1990s. Second, it aims to contribute to the
   demography of conflict and of food crisis. Most clearly, it finds strong
   evidence for a decrease in nuptiality and fertility associated with the
   1995 food crisis.},

Abstract = {This study presents an internally consistent macroeconomic framework
   that could be used as a first step toward a more comprehensive
   quantitative and qualitative assessment of the adjustment alternatives
   facing Uzbekistan. The three-gap framework focuses on the major
   imbalances of the economy for evaluating policy choices facing
   Uzbekistan. It lays emphasis on both domestic and external factors that
   determine economic outcomes and welfare. An attempt is made to quantify
   two policy scenarios (gradual as against an accelerated policy
   implementation strategy). It turns out that an aggressive adjustment
   policy would indeed improve most performance and welfare indicators. Two
   major ingredients of such an aggressive adjustment strategy are the
   unification of the exchange rate and implementation of current account
   convertibility in the balance of payments. The study also draws
   attention to the relative importance of external financing and the
   sustainability of the balance of payments under alternative structural
   adjustment paths facing Uzbekistan.},

Abstract = {Many countries are updating their consumption models from the
   conventional linear model to circularity in an era of overconsumption
   and, as a result, steady growth in waste. One of the important markers
   of the circular economy is waste management. This study aims to analyze
   the potential of improving the waste management system with the
   implementation of the Action Plan for the transition to a circular
   economy. Analysis of panel data with fixed and random effects and the
   synthetic control method were used. Data was collected for Kazakhstan
   and 27 European Union countries for the period 2010-2020. Appropriate
   tests, such as the Fischer test, Wald statistics, and placebo test, were
   carried out for reliability and adequacy of the research results.
   Results showed that the recycling rate of municipal waste in Kazakhstan
   would be significantly higher if the Action Plan for the transition to a
   circular economy were adopted. Conclusions and recommendations have been
   drawn based on the findings and analysis.},

Abstract = {This article examines the roles of international policy diffusion and
   domestic politics in shaping the design of an emissions trading system
   (ETS) in Kazakhstan. We find that although the overall framework for the
   Kazakh ETS and many of its design elements are based on the EU ETS,
   domestic political factors were central mediating variables in the
   diffusion process. The system was initiated at the highest levels within
   the government, but the fast-tracked nature of the implementation
   process did not provide sufficient notification to the donor community
   to mobilize much-needed technical support until the pilot phase had been
   completed. Implementation of a fully operational system was postponed
   until 2018 due to industry mobilization against the system and
   unresolved legal and technical issues. The findings indicate that the
   longer-term outcome of a diffusion process can be policy divergence, not
   convergence, as domestic interest groups influence policy and as
   governments learn from their own implementation experiences.},

Abstract = {Little is known presently about how, why, and with what consequences
   audiences comment on their news in contemporary authoritarian regimes.
   In order to address this gap, this study leverages recent theorizing
   about the multiple public sphere under non-democratic rule. Accordingly,
   critically commenting publics are theorized as ``input institutions{''}
   that not only create risks but also offer important benefits for
   autocrats. Grounded in this approach, the study develops a series of
   hypotheses about the extent of political criticism that should be
   visible beneath the news in three purposefully selected authoritarian
   contexts: Azerbaijan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. In order to test these
   hypotheses, commenting environments facilitated (or not) by 46 leading
   news organizations on seven platforms were considered (N=322). For each
   environment, coders established whether comments were published that
   were (1) critical of the autocrat himself, (2) critical only of
   lower-level policies or officials of the regime, or (3) entirely
   uncritical. As the findings show, the extent of readers' criticism
   differed systematically between the three contexts, broadly following
   the patterns hypothesized. Moreover, in line with this study's key
   assumptions, critically commenting publics were facilitated not only by
   opposition media but also by substantial numbers of state-controlled
   news organizations.},

Abstract = {We apply the Ricardian approach to analyse the economic impact of
   climate change on agriculture using the 2007 World Bank Tajikistan
   Living Standards Survey. The study analyses data of 2557 farm households
   in 166 villages across the 10 agro-ecological country zones. In general,
   the results indicated that increasing temperature and precipitation will
   both be damaging to Tajikistan agriculture and consequently to the net
   revenue (NR) of farmers in the medium and long term. Regressing NR on
   climate parameters, household and soil variables showed that these
   variables have a significant impact on the farmers' NR per hectare. We
   examined the impact of the current climate on farmers' NR per hectare,
   and how that is affected by future climate scenarios: one +2.9 degrees C
   warming and one 4.6 degrees C warming scenarios. Although the analysis
   did not incorporate variables such as the carbon fertilization effect,
   the role of technology or the change in prices in the future,
   significant information for policy-making can be extracted. Tajikistan
   has very diverse regions in terms of geography, population density and
   socio-economic situation; our results will help policy-makers to
   anticipate the adaptation effort needed in different locations of the
   country.},

Abstract = {The Tashguzar-Baysun-Kumkurgan (TBK) railway connection, completed in
   2007 in southern Uzbekistan, provided a domestic through line to link
   rail stretches formerly connected only via neighboring Turkmenistan. We
   hypothesize that a better integrated domestic rail system would yield
   economic spillovers beyond the regions actually traversed by the new
   connector to generate higher growth for neighboring regions and even for
   the far terminal reaches of the system. We test for this using a
   difference in difference approach that assesses the impact of the rail
   connector on economic performance for each of three regional groupings
   relative to a control group of unaffected regions. We further
   distinguish effects for the short term (2008), medium term (2009-10),
   and long term (2011-12). We find statistically significant increases in
   GDP growth for all three regional groupings at medium or long term
   horizons with magnitudes of increase up to 2.6 percentage points per

Abstract = {This article focuses on the trading trajectory of an Uzbek family of
   merchants from Tajikistan. This family runs businesses in both
   Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, and China's famous international trading
   city: Yiwu. The analysis is centred on the accounts placed by
   Tajikistan's Uzbek merchants about their historically sustained
   experience, often across several generations, in trading activities.
   These merchants' claims of belonging to a `historical' trading community
   rather than being `newcomers' to long-distance commerce are articulated
   in relation to notions of `hierarchies of trade' as they evolve in a
   twofold relational model linking Yiwu's Changchun neighbourhood and
   Dushanbe. I suggest that the forms of conviviality enacted in Yiwu's
   Changchun neighbourhood need to be understood in terms of the
   historical, multinational and transregional contacts that have occurred
   within the spaces of the former Soviet Union, as well as along the
   China-Russia and China-Central Asian borders. Equally, the hierarchies
   of trade of Uzbek merchants from Tajikistan in Yiwu's Changchun
   neighbourhood cut-across markers of identity that juxtapose the roles of
   Tajik and Uzbek communities in Tajikistan's contemporary politics and
   economics.},

Journal = {POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study explores the formation of the urban middle class in
   Tajikistan, a low-income country in which large outmigration has
   developed over the past decades. Our study uses a Bourdieusian framework
   to note the ways international migration creates opportunities for class
   in the context of socio-political constraints, which hinder upward
   social mobility of Tajikistan's population. Drawing from ethnographic
   research in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, our study investigates the cultural
   production of the urban middle class and contextualises its contested
   nature. We address the dynamic quality of class distinctions through the
   lens of culture, status, and symbolic values to unpack social and
   cultural processes that shape the formation of class in post-Soviet
   Tajikistan. We argue that although managing competing constraints, Tajik
   migrants use migration-related capital to become a part of the growing
   middle class. Our study contributes to scholarship on migration and
   class and suggests that analytical attention to different types of
   capital allows for a better understanding of class formation in sending
   countries.},

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of ethical positions of the
   respondents from Hungary, China, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan. In the context
   of globalization, when the process of global economic, cultural, social
   integration occurs, the effectiveness of interaction between countries
   and peoples, especially in trade and economic relations, depends on the
   understanding of the concept of business ethics. Therefore, the
   understanding of national aspects of business ethics plays a significant
   role. The idea of business ethics may vary depending on the national and
   cultural characteristics, traditions, mentality and stereotypes of the
   country with which the interaction takes place. Therefore, it is
   necessary to study the ethical position. To do this, we conducted a
   survey, using the Foresight questionnaire, among 905 respondents from
   Hungary, China, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan, who are students of the
   Department of Business, and had work experience in private and public
   sector. The results of the study confirm the hypothesis that ethical
   position differs depending of nation, gender, and work experience.},

Journal = {RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION},

Volume = {29},

Pages = {513-533},
Abstract = {This paper explores the current education reform agenda in Kazakhstan,
   which is underpinned, in part, by the argument that investment in human
   capital through elite institutions for gifted children can lift up the
   whole system of education. The paper revisits two broad theoretical
   perspectives, relating to human capital and to ideas about education for
   gifted and talented children in their role as important assets for
   economic prosperity. Drawing upon examples from primary data, this paper
   examines the multifaceted model of education for gifted children that is
   being developed in Kazakhstan, which seeks to combine an internationally
   recognised curriculum with elements from national educational
   traditions. It involves strategic partnership with major international
   educational providers focusing on professional development of teachers.
   The paper argues that elite education as a model for social change has
   both advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, any change that is likely to
   make a long-term difference will take time to become embedded. The paper
   concludes by highlighting themes that would merit future research in
   Kazakhstan, and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Khrushchev's Secret Speech about Stalinist crimes in February evoked
   heated public responses in many parts of the USSR. In stark contrast,
   the momentous changes of 1956 evoked little controversy among

   studied as a state-led attempt to breathe a new life into communism, or
   a process in which the regime and its citizens negotiated the meanings
   of Soviet utopia after the traumas of Stalinism. But the Kazakhstani
   case suggests that state-society dynamics in 1956 were often shaped not
   so much by the revolutionary state and the practices of searching for
   socialism', but rather by the limited reach of utopian ideas, the
   weakness of Soviet structures in the provinces, and deep social and

Title = {The Effects of Orientation on Energy Consumption in Buildings in
   Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {135},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings account for nearly 40\% of the end-use energy consumption and
   carbon emissions globally. These buildings, once built, are bound to be
   utilized for several decades if not longer. The building sector,
   therefore, holds a significant responsibility for implementing
   strategies to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions and
   thus contribute to global efforts directed toward mitigating the adverse
   effects of climate change. This paper presents an overview of the effect
   of building orientation on energy consumption in buildings for the
   extreme cold weather conditions in Astana (capital of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan), with temperature ranging between -35 and +40 degrees C.
   Passive design features coupled with integration of renewable energy
   technologies have been identified for the next generation of buildings
   in Astana. The specific nature of the work is intentional; it is a
   continuing attempt to generate relevant know how that has direct
   relevancy to Astana's system approach to energy conservation to meet its
   extreme winters. Simulations allowed assessing how changing certain
   input variables can impact the overall energy consumption of the
   considered object. The simulation results have shown that orientation of
   a building can significantly affect the energy usage rate. In fact, the
   building rotation has justified the initial assumptions that building
   orientation affects its energy consumption. The South and North facing
   directions are found to be the most energy efficient (initial
   orientation is 35 degrees toward the North-East). These findings have
   been confirmed by the separate calculations based on the local and
   international standards and codes.},

Abstract = {The development of large-scale irrigation agriculture in the arid region
   of Central Asia, which was initiated in the 1960s under the former
   Soviet Union, has resulted in soil salinization in irrigated farms and
   their vicinity. In order to establish an appropriate countermeasure
   against soil salinization, we investigated the distribution pattern of
   salt-affected soils and their forming processes in rice-based cropping
   fields and their surroundings in four former state farms in the R. Ili
   and R. Syr-Darya basins in southern Kazakhstan. In the farm along R.
   Iii, two types of distribution patterns of salts in the soil profiles
   were observed. The first process was observed in cultivated and
   uncultivated fields adjacent to the irrigation,canal, and characterized
   by an accumulation of gypsum and/or soluble salts at/near the soil
   surface, suggesting an upward movement of water with a high
   concentration of salts. The second process was observed in uncultivated
   fields far from canals. Salt accumulation was observed in deeper
   horizons in combination with a low-salt, alkalinized layer on top,
   indicating that the soils were formed by leaching with a positive
   reaction for residual sodium carbonate. In the surface soil layer under
   upland cropping, amounts of soluble cations was 16.6 +/- 3.4 (SE)
   cmol(c) kg(-1) in the farm located in the lower part of R. Syr-Darya,
   which was much higher than that in the farm along R. Iii (4.8 +/- 0.4
   cmol(c) kg(-1)). In the latter, the annual rate of salt accumulation
   during the first year of upland cropping was roughly estimated to 45
   kmol(c) ha(-1) year(-1), while in the second year the accumulation was
   about 15 kmol(c) ha(-1) year(-1). The contents of soluble salts
   decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.6 cmol(c) kg(-1) during the period of rice
   cultivation in the farm along R. Iii, showing that water-logging in this
   phase was effective to leach out the salts accumulated during the upland
   phase. The soils in the paddy field in the R. Syr-Darya basin showed,
   however, still a high salinity level, i.e. 5.6 +/- 1.2 cmol(c) kg(-1),
   presumably because of the incomplete drainage conditions. These results
   suggested that the rice-based irrigation agriculture studied is
   sustainable provided that an adequate supply of irrigation water and an
   appropriate drainage system are available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {144-152},

Abstract = {This article explores the gendered process that leads to women informal
   miners' restricted access to natural resources, their exclusion and
   their stigmatization in one village in the Muslim post-Soviet space.
   Drawing on eight months of ethnographic work in the village of Kante in
   Northern Tajikistan, this article seeks to understand how and why this
   process is mediated through notions of honor and shame traditionally
   seen as anchored in Muslim religion. A focus on changing masculinities
   and their relationship with women miners' exclusion in this extractive
   landscape where informal coal mining developed alongside male migration
   and the setting up of a Sino-Tajik coal mine after the fall of the
   Soviet Union, allows us to develop a feminist political ecology of honor
   and shame. Here, I reveal how these cultural notions are mobilized in
   the wake of embodied and emotional work and resource struggles and the
   gendered impacts of broader politico-ecological changes. I particularly
   link women miners' exclusion and its mediation through notions of honor
   and shame to men's loss of sense of self since the fall of the Soviet
   Union and the reconfiguration of masculinities with new work and
   resource struggles. By doing so, this article challenges the idea of
   Muslim men as fixed into codes of honor and patriarchy anchored in
   religion. Instead, it develops a re-theorization of Muslim masculinities
   which highlights instances where men oppress women at the same time as
   it challenges culturalist readings of gender and Muslimness that
   overemphasize culture/religion to the detriment of the
   economic/ecological.},

Abstract = {Engaging citizens in decision-making has become an important function of
   governments around the world. Local administrators facing budget
   constraints are interested in citizen feedback on a growing number of
   issues related to government performance. Based primarily on American
   evidence, the public administration literature notes that
   citizen-engagement tools have advantages and disadvantages. Some
   theorists suggest that combining participatory tools can maximize their
   effects. This article extends the analysis by a consideration of how
   local governments in Kyrgyzstan, a transitional democracy, implemented
   participatory tools. It finds that merging such tools as citizen report
   cards and budget hearings led to improved participation outcomes,
   including changes in government service delivery. The study has
   important implications for developing effective participatory

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the granularity hypothesis in a large emerging
   economy, Kazakhstan. We use a new longitudinal dataset at the firm level
   and at quarterly frequency between 2012 and 2018 to document the size
   distribution of firms and to provide evidence that it follows a power
   law. We find that the largest 30 firms explain nearly 80 percent of the
   growth in aggregate total factor productivity. This confirms earlier
   research for the U.S. and other developed countries. However, the
   granular nature of the Kazakh economy is even more outspoken than in
   other countries. Thus idiosyncratic shocks and the way they ripple
   through the production network matter to understand changes in aggregate
   productivity growth. Moreover, since these granular firms are
   concentrated in the oil industry it exposes the vulnerability of the
   economy more to unexpected shocks in one industry in particular.},

Abstract = {After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kyrgyzstan went
   through radical economic reforms to transition from a command to a
   market-based economy. The governance system had to be rebuilt to reflect
   the country's shift from socialist ideology to free-market, democratic
   regime. Despite numerous reforms undertaken by the Kyrgyz Government to
   restructure its civil service, these efforts have fallen short in
   creating such a civil service system. To understand the reasons for the
   limited results achieved by reforms, this article examines formal rules
   regulating Kyrgyzstan's civil service and assesses how they are
   implemented in practice. Key aspects of Kyrgyzstan's civil service such
   as recruitment, selection, promotion, compensation, job security, and
   performance appraisal are examined. The article juxtaposes formal rules
   governing key elements of the civil service to the actual practices of
   the government. In conclusion, I offer an assessment of why civil
   service reforms produced inadequate results.},

Abstract = {Based on the quantitative assessment methodology, the study examined the
   socio-economic impact of tourism in the region. The study proposed and
   tested on the example of the Issyk-Kul region, as it is the most visited
   region of Kyrgyzstan. Accordingly, economic and social efficiency was
   estimated by the integral indicators formed at the use of the weight
   coefficients calculated on the statistical data, and the forecast for
   tourism development in the region. The study showed that the impact of
   tourism on economic and social growth in the Issyk-Kul region is
   positive. Tourism in the region as a whole supports the growth of the
   economy, and the economic sphere of tourism has a strong impact on the
   social. According to forecasts, tourism will have a stable growth trend.
   Unlike previous studies, this study promotes a new understanding of the
   socio-economic impacts of tourism in the region.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the rigorous reading of Social Identity Theory (SIT), this
   paper reconstructs the ideational sources of Kazakhstan's status seeking
   by identifying the Kazakhstani perception of the (un)fairness of the
   international system, and the nature of the existing hierarchies in
   world society. By using the fine-tuned ideal types of status enhancement
   strategies as the basis of the coding scheme, a qualitative content
   analysis of Kazakhstan's first president's speeches and texts reveals
   that Nursultan Nazarbayev adopted a social cooperation strategy. He
   perceived the international system as permeable, although rather unfair,
   but nevertheless open for improvement through multilateral cooperation.
   Nazarbayev accepted the negative results of comparison and responded
   with an adequate agency. He cultivated a special niche of foreign policy
   as a champion of nuclear non-proliferation, and a place for open and
   constructive dialogue. Therefore, Kazakhstan projected itself as a
   doctrineless good power, without an alignment to a particular great
   power.},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian presidents still use their legislative power?
   Although recent studies have argued that authoritarian legislatures are
   more than ?rubberstamps? and can serve as arenas for elite bargaining
   over policy, there is no evidence that legislators would pass bills that
   go against presidential preferences. This article investigates this
   apparent paradox and proposes a theoretical framework to explain
   presidential activism in authoritarian regimes. It argues that any bills
   that contravene constraints on policy-making set by the president should
   generally be stopped or amended by other actors loyal to the regime.
   Thus, presidents will rather use their veto (1) to protect the regime?s
   output legitimacy and stability, and/or (2) to reinforce their power
   vis-?-vis other actors. The argument is tested using two case studies of
   veto use in Kazakhstan and Russia over the last 10 years. The analysis
   supports the propositions of the theoretical framework and furthermore
   highlights the potential use of vetoes as a means of distraction,
   particularly in relation to international audiences. The article extends
   research on presidential veto power to authoritarian regimes and its
   findings contribute to the growing literature on the activities of
   authoritarian legislatures.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to provide an account of how school leaders in
   Kazakhstan learn about leadership and management, and what strategies
   are in place to support leadership development. The paper draws on
   empirical data collected over three years, derived mainly from
   interviews and focus groups with school leaders and teachers. The
   findings suggest that a hierarchical education system and strict policy
   regulations diminish the likelihood that the changes needed to encourage
   leadership practice by teachers will take place. The paper examines
   Kazakhstani school leaders' learning opportunities, and focuses on the
   implications of borrowing leadership theories from the West. The key
   argument is that, if genuine change is to occur, these leaders will
   require time and space for critical reflection about what it is they
   need to learn and to do. The paper raises important issues about the
   conceptualisation of leadership learning and development in non-Western
   contexts.},

   Union. For President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev's nationalising regime the
   status of Kazakhstan as a colony represented a vital item in post-1991
   nation-building projects. Political opposition and Kazakh
   national-patriots contested this official discourse, blaming the regime
   for scarce efforts towards full decolonisation'. The absence of major
   intellectual discussion allowed these elites and political players to
   reappropriate these discourses in the political rather than critical
   intellectual domain.},

Abstract = {This article explores the controversy surrounding Borat Sagdiyev-the
   fictitious Kazakhstani reporter whose foibles mock Kazakhstan in
   particular and post-Soviet culture in general. With his appearances on
   Da Ali G Show, Sacha Bat-on Cohen's Borat persona long ago became the
   bete noire of the Kazakhstani government. However, when Borat was
   selected to host the MTV Europe Music Awards, the dispute over Borat's
   authenticity as a Kazakhstani became an international incident. In
   response to his negative portrayal of Kazakshilik (Kazakhness) through
   the deterritorialized medium of MTV, the government of President
   Nazarbayev threatened Baron Cohen with legal action and brought down his
   web site borat.kz. Baron Cohen immediately responded in character via
   his new domain 00 and defended the actions of Kazakhstan, thus fuelling
   the controversy. The ongoing feud has prompted an interesting postmodern
   praxis-one in which a fictional persona and national government can
   carry on a mass-mediated dialogue. As I document the details of this
   ongoing conflict on the global and local levels, I seek to explain the
   changes in the international system which have enabled this intriguing
   paradox. In doing so, I attempt to draw some larger conclusions on the
   importance of protecting national identity in the postmodern era,
   especially from threats (both internal and external) which weaken a
   country's global brand.},

Journal = {RURAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Khorezm Province is located in the Amu Darya lowlands of Uzbekistan,
   where unsustainable use of irrigation water has led to the Aral Sea
   crisis. This study deals with the question of how farmers in Khorezm
   perceive water and its management and how this facilitates or prevents
   water conservation, or ``water saving,{''} in irrigated agriculture. To
   answer this from the perspective of the water users, we apply Schutz's
   lifeworld concept to the study of natural-resource management, thereby
   reconstructing the water lifeworld of Khorezmian farmers. We present the
   spatial and temporal boundaries of the water lifeworld; the different
   types of water, people, and land that farmers distinguish; and the
   institutions water management is based on. The analysis shows that
   religious values and the risk of being fined for water wasting
   facilitate water saving. However, the following barriers to water saving
   dominate farmer practices: (1) storage of saved water is not possible,
   (2) using much water creates social capital, (3) perceived water needs
   exceed the geographical realities, (4) the term ``water saving{''} is
   not in use, and (5) farmers believe that water management is the state's
   responsibility. We conclude that water saving should be facilitated by
   environmental education, a strengthening of the water-inspection
   department Uzsuvnazorat, and the creation of decentralized storage
   options.},

Title = {Growing pains: graduate students grappling with English medium

Journal = {ASIAN ENGLISHES},
Abstract = {This study investigates graduate students' experiences with English
   medium instruction (EMI) in Kazakhstan. The data reported here were
   collected through an online survey conducted in 10 public and private
   universities in Kazakhstan in March-July 2021. This survey received a
   total of 320 responses from graduate students with diverse age, gender,
   disciplinary, educational, and linguistic profiles. Through a
   combination of closed and open-ended questions, we aimed to determine
   how graduate students coped with EMI in their programs. We found that
   most respondents are struggling with various aspects of academic reading
   and writing. Low English proficiency is often cited as a cause of these
   struggles, but so are specific elements of academic writing. Inadequate
   socialization in English together with gaps in existing language and
   writing support are also seen as factors. Overall, the data confirm the
   existence of deep ecological tensions between policy aspirations and
   enactment conditions on the ground.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {266-287},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan's National Council for Public Trust was created in response
   to the protests before and after the 2019 presidential elections and was
   promoted by the regime as a platform for dialogue between state and
   society. Such consultative institutions have been studied primarily
   through institutional-functional perspectives, which remain, however,
   unclear about the motives for setting up such councils and their
   effects. Based on an analysis of official narratives, this essay argues
   that Kazakhstan's National Council was established to promote a
   consultative ideology that advocates for state-organised dialogue
   between citizens and the government. As part of Kazakhstan's politics of
   stability, consultative ideology aimed at depoliticising requests for
   democratisation and civil society participation. However, as the regime
   did not fully deliver on its promise to involve relevant stakeholders
   and allow an open debate, official narratives were rejected by the
   protest movement and thus had limited depoliticising effects. It thus
   remains doubtful that consultative ideology will be effective and
   accepted by the general population.},

   evolved to a neo-nomadic tourism culture where authenticity becomes a
   currency at play and a point of differentiation from other tourism
   destinations. The findings offer an original approach to understand the

   development and explore how authenticity is positioned in the influx of

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {431-444},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Kazakh energy system is less efficient than most other national
   energy systems. The electricity and heat sub-systems account for about
   one half of the difference between the primary energy supply and the
   final consumption. After reviewing the technology chains of electricity
   and heat generation, transmission and distribution and their
   organisation, this paper presents scenario studies on the possible
   evolutions of these sub-systems to 2030. It describes the representation
   of the heat and electricity chains in the MARKAL-TIMES-Kazakhstan model,
   with focus on the residential and commercial sectors, and some key input
   data assumptions. The main scenario drivers are the need to improve the
   efficiency of electricity and heat in the residential and commercial
   sectors and to reduce GHG emissions from the energy system as a whole.
   The model results point to the possibility of achieving cost effective
   energy efficiency improvement of more than 2\% per annum and it would
   entail a net economic advantage to the country. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Educational reform and teachers' agency in reconstructing pedagogical
   practices in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE},
Abstract = {This paper explores how schoolteachers in Kazakhstan engaged with the
   Renewed Content of Education (RCE) that has been introduced by the
   Government, and how changes in their beliefs and understandings
   influenced classroom practice. The study draws on the ecological model
   of teacher agency and elaborates on factors that contribute to the
   formation of teacher agency. The study used a mixed methods research
   design and is based on data collected over two years in rural and urban
   schools across three regions of Kazakhstan. Altogether, 227 teachers
   having different levels of experience with the new curriculum were
   involved in focus group discussions. The findings demonstrate that the
   majority of teachers acknowledged the value of the RCE, its short- and
   long-term benefits for students, and the broader aim of boosting the
   economic competitiveness of the country. At the same time, the findings
   suggest that, while a surface change occurred in teachers' beliefs,
   their pedagogical practices, and the learning context, there is limited
   evidence that the teachers moved fully to new ways of teaching and
   embedded the principles of the RCE in practice. Through our findings, we
   verified the centrality of socially dynamic relationships in educational
   change. Teachers shared agency in developing their own rules and
   routines for collaboration. This paper adds to research on educational
   change in an international context by showing that the scope for teacher
   agency in reform implementation increases when teachers are able to
   develop deep reform-oriented beliefs, discourses, and pedagogical
   understanding.},

   However, few prior studies have included transitional or hybrid regimes

   conducted throughout a tumultuous transitional period in Kyrgyzstan, we
   find evidence for our hypotheses that citizens with greater corruption
   concerns will be more pro-democratic when evaluating democracy or its
   institutional components in the abstract; yet, they distrust existing
   government institutions. Even in a hybrid regime lacking democratic
   experience, citizens exhibit attributes of distrusting democrats.},

Title = {Circular Economy: Challenges and Opportunities in the Construction
   Sector of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The circular economy in the construction sector in emerging economies is
   one of the most promising concepts that aims to keep the value of the
   construction materials and structures as long as possible. The
   construction industry is rapidly developing in Kazakhstan with a yearly
   increase in projects. This research paper investigates the construction
   sector in Kazakhstan in terms of the potential application of circular
   economy principles by local stakeholders-clients, contractors,
   designers, and manufacturers. As limited research has been conducted on
   the circularity within the construction environment, including
   construction parties, this paper aims to fill this research gap. It
   seeks to identify the construction trends and perform a barrier and
   opportunity analysis to develop circular economy principles in the
   construction sector. As a research method, PEST is used for the study of
   local construction trends. At the same time, stakeholders are
   interviewed using semi-structured surveys organized according to the
   ReSOLVE framework (regenerate, share, optimize, loop, virtualize, and
   exchange) to identify the barriers and opportunities for circular
   economy in the construction sector. As an outcome of this study, the
   most common barriers and opportunities were associated with the economic
   benefit factor, as this was the main motivation for the stakeholders to
   save construction materials for reuse or to refuse more eco-friendly
   technologies. Additionally, policy recommendations for companies
   involved in the construction ecosystem were provided according to the
   assessment of found barriers and opportunities in the context of the
   ReSOLVE framework. This analysis has shown that for most stakeholders of
   the Kazakhstani construction sector, virtualization is of the highest
   priority; therefore, opportunities for its development are recommended.
   Future research could focus on the development of economically feasible
   solutions for the circular economy in construction with the inclusion of
   virtualization technologies.},

   pre-electoral spending to increase popular support, to deter potential
   opposition and to secure elite loyalty. Such electorally timed increases
   in spending help oil-rich leaders increase their re-election prospects
   and ensure their continued control over their countries' resources.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES},
Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to find out why the reforms of the
   long-term state policy for the development of national science did not
   lead to an increase in the funding of scientific research and an
   increase in the role of science in the national innovation system,
   including in the field of agricultural science. The study was conducted

   The results obtained in the course of the research are of practical
   interest to the authorized bodies of the state scientific and innovation
   policy of Kazakhstan, subjects of innovation infrastructure and
   entrepreneurs in the field of science and innovation. According to the
   results of the survey, the trend of scientists' dissatisfaction with the
   existing system of financing agro-industrial science is clearly traced,

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {In Uzbekistan, the pure monopoly enjoyed by the state-owned car
   manufacturer UzAvtosanoat has resulted in domestic car shortages and
   long waiting periods. This article examines the politico-economic
   mechanisms behind these shortages, as well as the ways in which the
   latter affect - and are curtailed by - aspirant car owners. It argues
   that shortages are a consequence of the Karimov-era policy of
   `self-reliance' and in particular of the goal of attaining a positive
   trade balance by means of export prioritization and import substitution.
   The article juxtaposes the workings of Uzbekistan's car industry and
   market with the Soviet era and suggests that they lead to the
   consolidation of a post-socialist shortage economy. Inevitably,
   similarly to their Soviet-era counterparts, local consumers face often
   insurmountable obstacles in their attempts to purchase a car and are
   exposed to access inequalities, debt, corruption, speculation, and the
   rent-seeking practices of local patronage networks.},

Abstract = {In Central Asia the European Union (EU) positions itself as a benign and
   gentle actor with no geopolitical intentions. But is this
   self-prescribed image of a `force for good' shared by Central Asians? To
   answer this question, the article scrutinizes whether the EU is
   perceived as posing a threat to or offering an opportunity in Kazakhstan
   and Kyrgyzstan. Theoretically it is argued that the EU cannot
   unilaterally claim a certain role in the region; rather, perceptions
   held by Central Asians partly determine what kind of actor the EU can be
   and what kind of policies it can successfully implement. The article
   finds that opportunity/threat perceptions are highly issue specific.
   Depending on a particular issue area, the EU's image may change from
   that of an opportunity to a threat, or vice versa. Yet, the opportunity
   aspect visibly prevails in both countries, which can be regarded as the
   EU's comparative advantage vis-a-vis other actors in the region.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This article examines the case of the Koryo saram, the ethnic Koreans
   living in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan, to reflect on how
   notions of diasporas, community, and identity have changed since the
   collapse of the Soviet Union. It contends that the Koryo saram are best
   understood through the lenses of diasporic conditions rather than as
   bounded communities, as such an approach allows for greater recognition
   of heterogeneity within these communities. While many Koryo saram
   continue to claim some form of Korean-ness, how they relate to issues of
   homeland-orientation and boundary maintenance evidences internal
   variation and growing in-betweenness. The community's hybridity
   ({''}hyphenization{''}) and liminality ({''}identity through
   difference{''}) stand out when examining generational differences and
   are especially evident among the local Korean youth.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of international migration on school
   enrolment of children staying behind in Tajikistan, by using data from a
   large nationally representative household survey. By correcting
   endogeneity and self-selection of migration and remittance with respect
   to school enrolment, the results show that migration of household
   members reduces the probability of enrolling in school by 10.3
   percentage points for children who belong to households with migrants.
   The effect of parental migration is larger than migration of other
   household members. Receiving remittances does not fully offset the
   adverse impact of migration.},

   of tourists based on temperature in the origin and destination countries
   over time by incorporating time-variant climate variables. The results
   reveal that the optimal temperature of international tourists visiting
   Kazakhstan is obtained at 7 degrees C. Moreover, international tourists
   prefer to travel to Kazakhstan at a moderate temperature, that is

Abstract = {What impact has the `Arab Spring' had upon Kazakhstan's approach to
   regime security? Short of the possibility of a `Central Asian Spring',
   if and how the Arab Spring reshaped this authoritarian regime has not
   been addressed. A longitudinal narrative analysis of Kazakhstan's
   presidential rhetoric from 2005 to 2015 and fieldwork interviews
   indicated that the Arab Spring uprisings brought about an elite-level
   demonstration effect. That is, the regime perceived a heightened threat
   to its security as a result of instability and regime responses
   elsewhere, and it sought to shore-up its position and forestall the
   emergence of local challenges as a consequence of this, whether through
   discourse, behaviour or policy. This suggests that uprisings elsewhere,
   including those outside of a state's immediate region, can affect
   perceptions of regime security in the medium term, despite the absence
   of domestic unrest at home and a lack of close social and cultural ties
   between regions.},

Abstract = {The presence of co-ethnic peoples within a borderland constitutes the
   core of most cases of irredentism, or the subjective perception that
   specific international borders fail to appropriately delimit national
   territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin publically rationalized his
   recent annexation of Crimea and cross-border interventions in Georgia
   and Eastern Ukraine through the alleged persecution of Russians in
   neighboring states (specifically Russkiy Mir). While much attention has
   been focused on the cases of outright invasion, it is important to
   evaluate other borderlands as sites of potential Russian actions.
   Central Asia's north-central steppe possesses a long history of shifting
   borders and demographics, which has given rise to varied claims to
   rightful ownership. This paper critically assesses potential irredentism
   and separatism in Kazakhstan's northern oblasts.},

   on residential segregation in the former state socialist countries of

   segregation. The aim of this study is to analyse ethnic post-Soviet
   segregation in housing in the medium-sized industrial city of

   Cities of the Rudnyi Altay, and linear and logistic regression to
   analyse segregation by dwelling type, housing size and facilities

   that the housing conditions of Kazakhs are considerably worse than those

Abstract = {The expansion of Russia into Asia in the second half of the 19th century
   was a beginning of a new era for the cultural heritage of Central Asia.
   Samarkand, which has become legendary since the Middle Ages with its
   magnificent Timurid monuments, was the most prominent center in this
   period. During the military activities of Russia, scientists and artists
   were also tasked with documenting various aspects of these lands. Vasily
   Vereshchagin was tasked with documenting both the military process of
   the Russian army and the cultural characteristics of the region, but his
   approach somewhat differs from many other Orientalists of the period.
   His paintings often reflect local and ethnographic elements with
   meticulous attention to detail; however, the emphasis on glorifying
   Russian dominance in these territories is also evident. His Samarkand
   scenes can be described as detailed visual documents about the situation
   of the Timurid monuments at the end of the 19th century, as well as
   providing clues about Russia???s perspective on the peoples of Central
   Asia, its history, and how Russia conceptually positioned itself against
   the Eastern world. In this paper, Vereshchagin???s Samarkand scenes are
   evaluated within the framework of their historical context, and the
   condition of the monuments is examined by comparison with the
   photographs of the same period.},

   identified and discussed in detail: `opponents', `moderate supporters'
   and `ardent supporters' of the EU normative policies. The article also

Abstract = {In the European Union's (EU) new Strategy for Central Asia, which was

   is singled out as a key priority. Drawing on post-development thinking,
   this article argues that if the EU is serious about promoting resilience
   to empower `the local' and contribute towards a truly sustainable future
   for the societies of Central Asian countries, then the EU will need to
   embrace a de-centred, post-neoliberal approach to resilience. This
   implies that the EU would have to accept `the other' - in this case, the
   Central Asian societies - for what they are and advocate home-grown
   self-organization based on a deep understanding of the local meaning of
   good life and local knowledge about the available resources. Empirical
   illustrations to substantiate this claim are drawn from a concrete case,
   namely the mahalla in Uzbekistan.},

Journal = {COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the years, civil society empowerment has become an integral part of
   the European Union's (EU) external and internal governance as a way to
   advance democracy and enhance citizen participation. While there has
   been increasing scholarly attention to the instruments and impact of the
   EU's civil society support, so far there has been little research on the
   question what kind of civil society the EU actually promotes. This
   article intends to fill this gap by examining the substance of the EU's
   civil society support in post Soviet Central Asia, a region where
   various forms of civil society organizations (CSOs) exist. The findings
   reveal a differentiation between civil society types promoted in EU
   strategic documents and those that are supported in practice. While at
   the strategic planning level the EU seeks to strengthen civil society
   broadly construed, at the program implementation level the (neo-)
   liberal CSOs are the main beneficiaries. At the same time, the EU
   customizes its civil society assistance depending on the realities on
   the ground and at times finds itself empowering state -led civil
   society, while communal groups rarely benefit from the EU assistance
   schemes. This has severe implications for the advancement of citizen
   participation, considering that the actual grass -root initiatives are
   largely excluded from the EU assistance. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {At independence in 1991, Tajikistan enjoyed almost universal literacy,
   reflecting the legacy of social development achieved during the Soviet
   period. However, since then the country has undergone immense economic,
   political and social upheaval, including civil war. As a consequence,
   the gains of the past are quickly being eroded. Recent evidence suggests
   that school attendance rates are declining, the gender gap is widening,
   and there is increasing geographical variation. This paper uses a unique
   source of data to investigate the relative roles of individual,
   household, and contextual factors to determine whether or not a child
   attends basic education in Tajikistan. Applying multilevel modelling and
   geographical information system techniques, the results show that
   contextual factors have a strong effect on school attendance. In
   particular, the accessibility and availability of school services and
   the quality of education have a positive effect. However, the level of
   economic development of the community in which the child lives exerts a
   negative effect on school attendance, reflecting the influence of higher
   opportunity costs of education in terms of the opportunities for
   income-generating activities forgone. This has implications for
   educational policy, highlighting that a joined-up approach is necessary
   to foster local economic development and to lower school dropout rates.

Abstract = {The study examines possible water savings by replacing alfalfa with
   winter wheat in the Fergana Valley, located upstream of the Syrdarya
   River in Central Asia. Agricultural reforms since the 1990s have
   promoted this change in cropping patterns in the Central Asian states to
   enhance food security and social benefits. The water use of alfalfa,
   winter wheat/fallow, and winter wheat/green gram (double cropping)
   systems is compared for high-deficit, low-deficit, and full irrigation
   scenarios using hydrological modeling with the HYDRUS-1D software
   package. Modeling results indicate that replacing alfalfa with winter
   wheat in the Fergana Valley released significant water resources, mainly
   by reducing productive crop transpiration when abandoning alfalfa in
   favor of alternative cropping systems. However, the winter wheat/fallow
   cropping system caused high evaporation losses from fallow land after
   harvesting of winter wheat. Double cropping (i.e., the cultivation of
   green gram as a short duration summer crop after winter wheat
   harvesting) reduced evaporation losses, enhanced crop output and hence
   food security, while generating water savings that make more water
   available for other productive uses. Beyond water savings, this paper
   also discusses the economic and social gains that double cropping
   produces for the public within a broader developmental context.},

Abstract = {Agriculture significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and
   thus to climate change, directly through farm operations and indirectly
   through the energy needed to produce input materials, most prominently
   fertiliser, as well as through nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils.
   Agriculture is the largest consumer of phosphorus, which is a
   non-renewable resource. Cotton accounts for one third of all natural and
   synthetic fibres of the total textile production. Today, Xinjiang,
   China, has become one of the most important cotton producers with
   highest yields worldwide. The aim of this study was to calculate the
   carbon (climate footprint and energy footprint) and phosphorus footprint
   of this high yielding cotton. production and compare it to a theoretical
   production of an alternative fibre from Apocynum (local name: Kendyr or
   Kutra), which is a bast fibre plant native in Xinjiang and Central Asia.
   The data of the cotton production was collected through farm interviews
   during six years in Xinjiang. The data for Apocynum was compiled by
   literature from field experiments in the former Soviet Union. Cotton
   fibres, mainly due to high fertiliser inputs, caused a climate footprint
   of 4.43 kg CO2e/kg fibre, an energy footprint of 30.90 MJ/kg fibre, and
   a phosphorus footprint of 101 g P/kg fibre. The footprints of Apocynum
   are significantly lower with a climate footprint of 1.93 kg CO2e/kg
   fibre, an energy footprint of 21.85 Mj/kg fibre, and a phosphorus
   footprint of 1.6 g P/kg fibre. In cotton production, 63.9\% of the
   climate footprint and 68.4\% of the energy footprint are attributed to
   fertiliser production. Soil emissions of N2O account for another 22.2\%
   of the climate footprint of cotton. The biggest potential to reduce
   carbon and phosphorus footprints of cotton production lie in reduced
   fertiliser application and re-use of plant residues. In the case of
   Apocynum, 65.1\% of the climate footprint and 64.1\% of the energy
   footprint are attributed to chemical treatment of the fibres in the
   extraction process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Astana's place as Beijing's most reliable political and economic partner
   in Central Asia. The two countries jointly implement large-scale

   promote cooperation in the field of energy and finance, deepen relations
   in the humanitarian and cultural spheres, strengthen partnership in the
   field of security. Given the relevance of the topic and its scientific
   and political significance, the goal was to explore the key importance
   of Kazakhstan and its role in the China's Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI), which is primarily due to the country's strategic and geographic
   location as a major land corridor connecting China to Russia and Europe
   via newly expanded rail and road networks. The research methodology
   includes content and discourse analysis tools, which are used to
   identify the dynamics of the development of relations between China and
   Kazakhstan, as well as the synergistic effect of combining the Chinese
   BRI and Kazakhstan's Nurly Zhol program on the development of
   Kazakhstan's economy. Such a perspective of synergy is of great
   importance in the context of the modernisation of Kazakhstan's economy
   and in the conditions of the global economic crisis and falling oil

   proletarian and atheist culture that could replace former norms and
   homogenize beliefs and values. However, the use of theatre or cinema as
   a vector for cultural changes was also praised-in a less conceptualised
   manner-by some Muslim Turkestani elites, who had come to consider, at
   least as early as 1913, performing and visual arts a mirror that could
   help society to understand its illnesses and thus to overcome them.. e
   early Soviet period radicalized these conceptions of power and
   enlightenment toward cinema, which proved a locus for political debates,
   modernization and agencies that were contended, throughout the 1920s and
   the 1930s, by Russian Communists and vernacular political or cultural
   elites in power. Examples of early anti-religious policy as well as film
   propaganda shed light on this process. In the Soviet context, the
   analysis of film production permits us to ascertain a complex set of
   dependencies and agencies between central and local powers, between
   artists and politics. This article will first focus on a brief
   institutional history and on the way vernacular elite and ordinary
   people welcomed the cinematographe in order to underline its peculiar
   position for our understanding of the cultural changesin the inter-war
   period. Second, it will examine how officials organised anti-religious
   policy in Uzbekistan, using film in particular. Finally, the article
   will discuss anti-religious films and their ambivalence until 1937.},

Abstract = {In discussions of post-communist transitional politics, it is
   commonplace to find arguments that attribute regime stability to a
   government's capacity to legitimize its policies. And the most robust
   source of such legitimacy is often adduced to economic achievements
   appreciated by the public. But many political theorists have developed
   an important distinction between regime stability that comes about
   through legitimacy and that which derives from naturalization, the
   latter being a population's acceptance of a regime and its policies
   because of the unthinkability of any alternative. Legitimization is most
   often considered to be the result of democratic procedures, while
   naturalization does not need democratic conditions to effect political
   stability. Collective conversations in the form of focus group
   transcripts reveal that the transitions in Estonia, Ukraine and
   Uzbekistan evidence both forms of political stabilization. In Estonia,
   discourses of legitimization and naturalization are evident; in
   Uzbekistan, some legitimization, but little naturalization; but in
   Ukraine, neither source of support for the continuation of the
   transition is available.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {International student mobility from East to West has grown rapidly as
   the middle classes have sought to reproduce their advantage in the
   context of changing socioeconomic circumstances. Existing research shows
   that middle-class students and their parents are increasingly using
   overseas educational qualifications-an institutionalised form of
   cultural capital-to ensure that they stand out in the competition for
   lucrative employment. This paper makes two unique contributions to these
   debates. Firstly, it broadens the spatial frame away from East Asia to
   the emerging educational markets in post-Soviet Central Asia, and
   specifically Kazakhstan. This shift allows examination of similarities
   in students' accrual of cultural capital between regions, but also
   highlights spatial specificity in these flows. Secondly, it moves beyond
   narrowly class-based approaches to spotlight the importance of gender,
   sexuality, and religion in geographies of cultural capital. Middle-class
   social reproduction helps drive international student mobility, but
   class is experienced differently by young men and women in the context
   of locally specific forms of heterosexuality which in this case study
   reflect the cultural importance of Islam. Class matters, but to fully
   understand its importance in student mobility we must trace its
   intersections with other axes of social difference.},

Title = {Coping Responses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Cultural
   Comparison of Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Peru},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {55-74},
Abstract = {Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected people around the world
   to severe stress, evoking a variety of coping responses. Coping
   responses can be broadly classified into four strategies: 1)
   problem-focused coping; 2) emotion-focused coping; 3) socially supported
   coping; and 4) avoidance. While there is a wide variability of
   individual coping responses, to some extent they are also culturally
   specific.
   Objective. This study aimed to compare the differences in the prevalence
   and factor structure of coping responses during COVID-19 pandemic in
   three countries: Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Peru.
   Design. The sample included 501 participants from Russia, 456
   participants from Kyrgyzstan, and 354 participants from Peru. The mean
   age of participants was 28 years in Russia (SD = 13.5); 24 years in
   Kyrgyzstan (SD = 10.0); and 30 years in Peru (SD = 12.3). In Russia and
   Kyrgyzstan, coping strategies were assessed with an abbreviated Russian
   adaptation of the COPE (Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced)
   questionnaire. In Peru, coping responses were assessed using the Spanish
   version of the Brief COPE questionnaire. The average scores from fifteen
   COPE scales were used as the input data for linear modelling and factor
   analysis.
   Results. The coping scores varied substantially within each country.
   Differences between countries accounted for 17.7\% of the total
   variability in religious coping; 15.8\% in acceptance; 13.9\% in mental
   disengagement; and less than 7\% in the other coping strategies. No
   difference in the prevalence of coping responses was found between
   Russian and Kyrgyz participants after accounting for age and gender. In
   all three countries the coping responses were associated with the same
   four coping domains: problem-focused coping, socially supported coping,
   avoidance, and emotion-focused coping. Four factors explained up to 44\%
   of the total variation in the COPE scores. Religious coping and mental
   disengagement were classified into different coping domains in the three
   countries.
   Conclusion. The results suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic,
   people from different countries apply the full range of coping responses
   within the four universal coping strategies. Religious coping and mental
   disengagement differed the most across the countries, suggesting that
   some coping behaviors can take on different roles within the system of
   coping responses to stressful events. We attribute these differences to
   differing cultural and socioeconomic characteristics, and the different
   measures taken by governments in response to COVID-19.},

Abstract = {The current scholarly discussion concerning the Belt and Road Initiative
   (BRI) seeks to connect the investment activities on the ground with its
   strategic objectives, and attributes their mismatch to subnational
   factors or third-party interventions. Few scholars question the
   fundamental conceptualization of the BRI as a new grand strategy. First,
   this paper argues that China has not dictated the Central Asian
   development agenda, nor has it demonstrated a strong capability for
   institutional innovation. It then adopts the foreign policy analysis
   approach to trace the regional, international, and domestic factors
   shaping the content of the BRI. In particular, this paper finds out that
   the BRI reveals Beijing's strong consistency in economy-driven diplomacy
   while recalculating the interests and risks of participation in economic
   globalization. The BRI should not be interpreted as a new concrete
   strategy to challenge the existing world order.},

Abstract = {Central Asia currently plays an important role on the global stage due
   to its geographical position and the region has been receiving increased
   research attention. We conducted a bibliometric analysis for the years
   1900-2016 to evaluate differences in global research on Central Asia
   before and after the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
   (USSR), based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social
   Science Citation Index(SSCI) databases. This paper adopted a comparative
   analysis approach and summarized publication outputs, subject
   categories, country productivity, collaborations, title keywords and
   institution productivity on Central Asia before and after the collapse
   of the USSR. We analyzed the relationship between global research
   outputs on Central Asia and relevant impact factors, including the
   number of tourists, exports of fuel oil and gross domestic product
   (GDP). Comparing results before and after the collapse of the USSR, our
   bibliometric analysis revealed the following: (1) publications on
   Central Asia experienced a meteoric growth and publications in the SCIE
   played a dominant role after the collapse of the USSR; (2) Geology,
   Environmental Sciences \& Ecology and Paleontology increased the most
   while Science \& TechnologyOther Topics, Geography and Anthropology
   decreased dramatically; (3) research countries became increasingly
   diversified and publications were produced by increasing numbers of
   international collaborations with a diversification of major
   collaborators; (4) the focus of title keywords differed before and after
   the collapse of the USSR; (5) institutions became more diversified and
   most of them focused on natural sciences; (6) there were high
   correlations between publications on Central Asia and the number of
   tourists, exports of fuel oil and GDP. These results reflect the close
   relationship between scholarly outputs on Central Asia and relevant
   factors, including the number of tourists, export of fuel oil and GDP.
   Increasing scholarly outputs on Central Asia therefore had a positive
   impact on global Central Asia research.},

Abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) has emerged as a serious public health
   issue in migrant communities in Central Asia and globally. To date,
   however, research on risk factors associated with male perpetration of
   IPV among migrants remains scant. This study aims to examine risk
   environment theory-driven factors associated with male perpetration of
   IPV in the prior 6months. We recruited, enrolled, and surveyed a
   respondent-driven sample of 1342 male market workers in Almaty,
   Kazakhstan, that included 562 (42\%) non-migrants defined as Kazakhstan
   citizens who reside in Almaty; 502 (37\%) external migrants from
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, or Uzbekistan; and 278 (21\%) internal migrants
   from other areas of Kazakhstan. We conducted multivariate logistic
   regressions to estimate the effects of physical, economic, and political
   risk environment factors on IPV perpetration by migration status after
   controlling for potentially confounding socio-demographic and
   psychosocial variables. A total of 170 participants (12.7\%) reported
   ever perpetrating physical or sexual IPV and 6.7\% perpetrated such IPV
   in the prior 6months. Multiple logistic regression results suggest that
   the risk environment factors of poor living conditions, exposure to
   political violence, and deportation experiences are associated with IPV
   perpetration among external and internal migrants, but not among
   non-migrants. Food insecurity is associated with IPV perpetration among
   external migrants and non-migrants, but not among internal migrants.
   Homelessness and arrests by police are associated with IPV perpetration
   among internal migrants, but not among external migrants or
   non-migrants. These findings underscore the need to consider the unique
   combination of risk environment factors that contribute to male IPV
   perpetration in the design of programs and policies to address IPV
   perpetration among external and internal migrant and non-migrant men in
   Central Asia},

Title = {Participatory Research for Adaptive Water Management in a Transition
   Country - a Case Study from Uzbekistan},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Participatory research has in recent years become a popular approach for
   problem-oriented scientific research that aims to tackle complex
   problems in a real management context. Within the European Union project
   NeWater, stakeholder processes were initiated in seven case studies to
   develop approaches for adaptive water management. The Uzbek part of the
   Amudarya River basin was one of the studied river basins. However, given
   the current political and cultural context in Uzbekistan, which provides
   little room for stakeholder participation, it was unclear to what extent
   participation could be realized there. In this paper, we present an
   evaluation of the participatory research carried out in the Amudarya
   case study with respect to (i) the choice and application of different
   participatory methods and their adaptation to the given political,
   socioeconomic, and cultural environment, (ii) their usefulness in
   improving system understanding and developing strategies and measures to
   improve water management and monitoring, and (iii) their acceptance and
   suitability for enhancing policy-making processes in the Amudarya River
   basin context. The main lessons learned from the comparison of the
   different participatory methods were (1) the stakeholder process
   provided an opportunity for meetings and discussions among stakeholders
   from different organizational levels and thus promoted communication
   between different levels and organizations, and (2) in a context where
   most stakeholders are not generally involved in policy-making, there is
   a danger of raising expectations that a research project cannot meet, e.
   g., of transferring local interests to higher levels. Our experience
   shows that in order to choose participatory methods and adapt them to
   the Uzbek cultural and political setting (and most likely this applies
   to other post-Soviet transition countries as well), four aspects should
   be taken into account: the time required to prepare and apply the
   method, good information about the participants and the context in which
   the method will be applied, knowledge of the local language(s), and
   careful training of local moderators. While these aspects are relevant
   to any application of participatory methods, they become even more
   important in a political and socio-cultural setting such as that found
   in Uzbekistan. One added value of the activities and a crucial aspect of
   a participatory research processes was the capacity building of local
   scientists and practitioners, which facilitates the further application
   of the methods.},

   Almaty and other cities in Kazakhstan in 1986. In doing so, this article
   does not intend to simply set the two episodes side by side to discuss
   their similarities and differences. Rather, it aims to explore the
   common dynamics that influenced and, to a certain extent, shaped
   Kazakhstan as a polity in the second half of the twentieth century.},

   practice. Using the bound testing approach, within the Autoregressive
   Distributed Lag (ARDL) model framework, we examine their long-run
   relationship. Johansen Cointegration test, Engel-Granger two-step
   approach and Granger causality test reveal that the main determinants of
   KASE are income per capita, inflation and the exchange rate and dummy
   variable accounting for worldwide crisis impact. Other effect on stock
   index comes from oil price volatility measure, causing windfall gain
   effect as a consequence of rapid, but temporary, increase in oil price.},

Abstract = {Phenomenon of employment transformation in the modern economy is the
   subject of active discussions. Identification of factors influencing its
   development and the construction of a model of ``new{''} (non-standard)
   employment are particularly topical. Based on the results of previous
   studies, we have identified both personal (human capital, education) and
   external factors (digitalization, social protection), put them forward
   and tested hypotheses about their impact on non-standard employment. We
   have constructed a structural model that reflects both the factors
   affecting non-standard employment, and the socio-economic parameters of
   society affected by non-standard employment (income and social
   inequality). We have assessed reliability and internal consistency of
   the model as well. Based on the results obtained, we have determined the
   degree of studied factors' influence on non-standard employment in
   Kazakhstan.
   For the research, we used methods of online polling, modeling using
   structural equations (SEM) of SmartPLS software. Based on the results of
   the PLS analysis, we have identified two main issues of non-standard
   employment in Kazakhstan: a low level of social protection and inability
   to accumulate human capital of employees. Obtained determination
   coefficients (0.8, 0.5, and 0.58) indicate that the unstable nature of
   non-standard employment (instability, low wages) leads to an increase in
   poverty and social inequality. We have proposed measures to regulate
   these issues by improving legislation on social insurance for
   nonstandardly employed citizens, and taking active measures to promote
   employment, including a state employment program.},

Abstract = {Successful commercialization of technologies, including domestic ones,
   is the key term for an effective innovation system. One of the main
   conditions for this process or activity is properly integrated
   arrangement and economic mechanisms of governmental support, stimulating
   the innovation system participants' interaction. Programs to facilitate
   research and development commercialization are one of the forms of
   public support. Kazakhstan is specified by the weak development of
   program forms to support innovation. This study is aimed to recommend to
   implement programs of research and development commercialization in
   Kazakhstan by interviewing scientific and administrative employees of
   education and research institutes. The results of the study made it
   possible to provide a range of recommendations to improve programs
   facilitating commercialization as a form of public support.},

Title = {The Socioeconomic Impact of Tourism in East Kazakhstan Region:
   Assessment Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The article presents a methodical approach based on an integrated
   assessment of the social and economic impacts of tourism for East
   Kazakhstan Region. The assessment was done using indicators such as the
   number of tourists, accommodation units, tourism facilities' billing,
   and other statistical data for the period of 2009-2018. Integrated
   assessment performed using weighted sums of considered parameters and
   ordinary least squares linear regression method is applied for
   effectiveness prediction. Applied approaches of arithmetic (calculated)
   and multivariate regression modeling of the integral tourism efficiency
   demonstrated the same results, which mean the approach can be
   transferred and applied for other regions of Kazakhstan. Growing trends
   in tourism efficiency are derived and conclusions made on their
   importance for regional development. The economic and social impacts of
   tourism in East Kazakhstan Region increased significantly during the
   period from 2003 to 2018.},
