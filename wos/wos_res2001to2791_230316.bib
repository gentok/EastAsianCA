Abstract = {The dichotomy of Self/Other prevails in shaping identity. This article
   asks how and to what extent the elements of the EU's image produced by
   media discourse shape the national identity of Kazakhstan. It contends
   that a state's identity can be formulated not in opposition-that is, not
   `Us against Them'-but rather, `Us as One of Them'. It argues that, in
   the case of Kazakhstan, the predominantly positive media discourse about
   the EU `Other' contributes to a positive formulation of the Self via the
   legitimisation of the domestic regime on the national and international
   levels.},

Abstract = {The study deals with the socio-psychological factors influencing the

   services, products and services and foreign products from the countries
   of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The scope of the study covered
   three markets, namely, Kazakhstan, Russia and Belorussia, and the main
   research objectives were both to identify the level of receptivity of
   Kazakhstani consumers to domestic and foreign products and services and
   to measure the impact of this receptivity on their purchasing
   preferences. The results of the study showed that Kazakhstani consumers
   showed a relatively high level of ethnocentrism, animosity and
   conservatism toward products and services manufactured in Russia and
   Belorussia. The image of the country of origin of products and services
   manufactured in Russia and Belorussia in general created positive
   associations among Kazakhstani customers about products and services
   from these countries.},

Abstract = {The rapid pace of development of the digital economy is an effect
   conditioned by technology and innovation that have been developing over
   several decades and becoming more common. The number of Internet users
   in Kazakhstan increased from less than 1\% in the 1990s to 81 \% in
   2018, which happened due to a sharp decline in the cost of access and a
   high increase in computing power. The technological revolution has
   become a source of stimulating economic growth with less energy
   consumption. Digitalisation is considered to be a factor contributing to
   energy efficiency in the economy. The relationship between
   digitalisation, energy consumption and economic growth is a theme which
   has gained momentum recently. This paper attempts to estimate the
   effects of technology and economic factors on the energy intensity in
   Kazakhstan. The paper employs econometric methods: the unit root test,
   cointegration methods and the Granger causality test. All data were
   obtained from the World Bank's database for the period between 1994 and
   2018 as well as the Statistics Committee of the Ministry of National
   Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Odyssee database by EU.
   The results demonstrate that Internet usage and trade openness impact
   energy intensity. The results demonstrate that Internet usage and trade
   openness has a negative effect on energy consumption in the long run.
   The liberalisation trade and economy reduces the consumption of energy
   obtained from fossil fuels and minimises environmental degradation.
   Digitalisation is supposed to stimulate the efficiency of the energy
   system by optimising consumption and metering, reducing losses,
   generating with lowest possible costs and emissions, etc. Economic
   growth has a positive and statistically significant impact on energy
   intensity. The article contains certain recommendations for policy
   makers: the government should attract more investment and provide
   consistent support for ICT to increase the energy efficiency and to
   decrease total energy consumption.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the selection of workers to informal and formal

   correction model to assess the impact of observable and unobservable
   characteristics on the self- selection of workers into the formal and
   informal sector and on sector specific wages using individual level data
   from the Tajikistan Standards of Living Survey of 2007. The results
   suggest that selection of workers on both observable and unobservable
   characteristics to these sectors is broadly consistent with self-
   selection on comparative advantages, that the self- selection of workers
   on unobservable characteristics is the main reason for higher wages in
   the informal than the formal sector in Tajikistan and that relative
   wages in the two sectors have a rather strong impact on the decision of
   workers to work in the formal or informal sector.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Abstract = {This article is the first attempt to apply Putnis and Sauka's approach
   to direct measurement of the shadow economy through a survey of company
   managers in Central Asia. The results of the survey are used to
   calculate a shadow economy index for 2017 and 2018 in Kyrgyzstan, and to
   discuss the difference between direct and indirect methods in
   calculating the size of a shadow economy. We also propose a distinction
   between shadow economies and informality in general. While a shadow
   economy is usually understood to arise as a consequence of
   underreporting of income, we argue that informality is best understood
   as the aggregate of non-monetary and non-economic practices used in
   society. Applying this distinction to our case, we suggest that the
   origins of Kyrgyzstan's shadow economy are not only economic; rather
   social and cultural processes have had significant effects. This has
   implications for policy responses that address shadow economic
   activities.},

Title = {Competing Discourses in the Child Protection System in Kyrgyzstan:
   Implications for Redressing Gender Violence Against Girls},
Journal = {CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This paper explores competing discourses within state-sponsored social
   protection practices in Kyrgyzstan paying particular attention to how
   gender equality is integrated into the everyday work of professionals.
   Using Dorothy Smith's institutional ethnography framework, this
   article's analysis focuses on the invisible ruling processes dominating
   local activities and on prevailing narratives about the family, the
   state, and the roles of women and men therein. Primary data included 60
   in-depth interviews with representatives of state-funded institutions
   whose mandates comprise guaranteeing safe and violence-free lives for
   children and adolescents. Findings suggest that protection services are
   influenced by pervasive discourses that reflect dominant conventions
   about femininity, masculinity, family, and the nation. The prevailing
   cultural ideal of a strong Kyrgyz family works to place the primary
   responsibility for a child's upbringing and behavior on families and not
   the state. When such discourse is applied to victims of gender-based
   violence against girls, child victims are left outside of the protection
   system, become invisible to it, and ultimately remain marginalized.
   Front-line professionals use hybrid approaches to navigate multiple
   discourses, extend their work responsibilities and hours, and use their
   own resources to resist injustice. Yet these practices are fragmented
   and unsustainable. Moreover, they support the dominant patriarchal
   narratives and ultimately work to disempower the workers and the
   children involved.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the role of non-elites in the struggle for
   transparency and accountability in Kyrgyzstan's mining sector. Most
   existing accounts foreground elite strategies and political machines in
   the governance of post-Soviet societies. Drawing on recent
   anthropological work on post-Soviet politics and applying it critically
   to the literature on neopatrimonialism, this article sheds light on the
   adoption of political game strategies by community members (non-elites)
   to advance their interests and challenge elite dominance within the case
   study's mining communities. This finding responds to recent calls to
   interrogate the activities of non-elites at the margins of
   neopatrimonial contexts. The article advances a research agenda on how
   practices by non-elites shape the multiple meanings and enactments of
   transparency and accountability by elites in natural resource
   governance. It also points to the need to explore how and why
   ``communities{''} exert their ``agency{''} in governing natural
   resources within post-Soviet contexts.},

Abstract = {The sweeping political transition from the Soviet Union to independence
   in Tajikistan was accompanied by a devastating civil war. Social,
   economic, and demographic change followed. This research examines a
   critical indicator of human welfare and stability at the micro- and
   macro-levels: educational attainment and mobility. Using the 2007 Tajik
   Living Standards Survey, I compare cohorts educated before, during, and
   after the civil war. I examine the impact of the war and the political
   transition on educational attainment and mobility. The findings suggest
   that the consequences of civil war and political transition in
   Tajikistan were gendered: boys' attainment was disrupted when they lived
   in a conflict-affected area and were 16-to-17 years old when the war
   began; girls' attainment decline was more widespread. This research
   contributes to our understanding of the long-term consequences of
   political events on human capital accumulation over the life course.},

   Motivations to Preserve Floodplain Ecosystems Based on Household Survey},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The floodplain areas along the Naryn River in Kyrgyzstan are essential
   as they hold the riparian (local) ecosystems because they provide
   firewood, pastureland, and areas for recreation and protection against
   erosion. Due to limited access to adequate, reliable, and sustainable
   energy services, the rural population usually derived their energy needs
   from multiple natural energy resources (i.e., firewood, charcoal,
   agricultural residues, animal dung, and wood branches). This is
   considered a common and predominant practice in rural Kyrgyzstan. This
   situation leads to a negative impact on local ecosystem services. In
   addition to that, the reliance on solid fuels contributes to indoor and
   outdoor air pollution, which is partially threatening the local
   ecosystem services. By contrast, the employment of renewable-based
   energy supply systems would substantially reduce the burden on the
   environment, which is mainly untapped. To integrate renewable energies,
   it is important to understand the energy behavior of floodplain
   communities. In that response, the presented article is the first
   attempt to capture the energy identity of the floodplain community of
   Kyrgyzstan based on a quantitative energy-based (on-site) household
   survey. Furthermore, the present research article synthesizes the
   driving factors that have a (direct or indirect) impact on the energy
   and local ecosystem services. In addition, the present article proposes
   a brief pathway for the sustainable energy transition. The article
   records the recommendation to integrate renewable energies to preserve
   the local ecosystems of Kyrgyzstan.},

   Participants discussed their motives for migrating, experiences in
   Russia, and the impact on their views of Russia. In contrast to the
   overwhelmingly negative portrayals that predominate in prior accounts,
   they report a diverse set of experiences. For many, appreciation for
   income earned in Russia is the most salient aspect of their time there,
   outweighing more negative aspects. Their views of Russia are generally
   positive, in part due to their perceptions of where they stand in
   Russia's ethnic hierarchies. These findings suggest that Russia's
   reputation benefits from migration through what we call geopolitical
   remittances.},

Abstract = {A method is presented that uses a Geographic Information System (GIS)
   for integrating social science with physiographic data. Basis for the
   method is an empirical study on water use in irrigated agriculture in
   the Khorezm region. The boundaries of agricultural fields are used to
   link physiographic land characteristics such as proximity to the
   Amudarya river, land elevation etc. to survey answers of farmers,
   thereby explaining patterns of water access and water-saving practices.
   The results are based on (1) a statistical analysis across three water
   user associations (WUAs) and (2) visual observations within WUAs. The
   statistical analysis shows that proximity to the river influences water
   access and water-saving practices. One WUA thereby represents a specific
   tail-end situation within Khorezm's irrigation system with an
   exceptional prevalence of water-saving practices. In the visual
   analysis, the location of farms within the WUA and the land elevation
   are used to explain patterns of the survey answers. Despite data and
   method constraints and despite sometimes contrasting results from the
   statistical and visual analyses, it is concluded that the method has
   three advantages as compared to disciplinary, non-spatial approaches:
   (1) interdisciplinary data management is possible, including the
   identification of data gaps and consistency checks, (2) immediate data
   visualization facilitates quick monitoring of research processes and
   delivers starting points for disciplinary in-depth analyses, and (3)
   interdisciplinary data integration allows for truly socio-physical
   analyses. The analytical depth reached in the empirical study is thereby
   primarily a result of the quality and quantity of the collected data.
   Considerations concerning the protection of informants determine which
   kind of analyses can be conducted and published.},

Abstract = {After the independence of Central Asian countries, many international
   projects have been launched to promote water users' inclusion into the
   water management at different levels. The aim of such projects is to
   achieve sustainable water management through inclusion of interests of
   different groups on day-to-day water management. Although IWRM in
   Central Asia has been already promoted for a decade, there are only a
   few examples of the implementation in real life situations.
   The Integrated Water Resources Management in Ferghana Valley (IWRM FV)
   is a pilot project on implementing integrated water resources management
   elements at the main canal levels and below. The experience gained from
   IWRM FV project and lessons learnt could be useful for the national and
   international organizations for their future work on IWRM implementation
   at the different regions of Central Asia.
   IWRM FV project has been active since 2001 in the Ferghana Valley, one
   of the largest irrigated areas of Central Asia. The project has promoted
   and implemented participatory irrigation management for three pilot
   canals. This paper presents the process of implementation and some
   preliminary outcomes of the IWRM VF project. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Rather than studying young men's career- and/or economic-based
   aspirations, this article explores the obstacles that hinder youths of
   both sexes in gerontocratic southern Tajikistan and North India from
   developing the capacity to make their own life choices. Focusing mainly
   on the selection of marital partner and largely on women, I explore the
   narratives of those who have never even dreamed of a good life, of
   others who have dreamed but been unable to actualize their dreams, of a
   few who have started to plan the way forward, and of a tiny number who
   actually managed to achieve their aspirations, teasing out the
   influences that facilitate this. I suggest that even educated youths
   with some control over their public lives are constricted by their
   family relations and that it requires quite specific support to defy
   one's family, which can create significant vulnerabilities in settings
   with no other safety net.},

Abstract = {The progresses in technology lead to advances in e-learning as well as
   lead to increase in number of learners participating in e-learning
   courses. Richness of online resources, activities, and communication
   tools presented in online courses can be one of the factors that
   influence learners' attendance to e-learning. In this regard, the
   initial purpose of this study was to identify online resource, activity
   and communication tool preferences of learners studying in two public
   universities: one located in Turkey and one located in Kyrgyzstan. At
   the second stage, comparison of Turkish and Kyrgyz learners' preferences
   was carried out to explore differences in two countries. The
   participants are first-year undergraduate learners enrolled in
   first-year courses in the online environment. The total number of
   participants is 370, which involves 185 Turkish learners and 185 Kyrgyz
   learners. In the context of this study, participants' submissions to the
   questionnaire were collected as quantitative data; while participants'
   opinions toward online resources, activities, and communication tools
   were obtained as qualitative data. Thus, the study was designed as a
   mixed methods research that quantitative and qualitative methods were
   applied for the data analysis. The results demonstrated that Turkish
   learners perceive communication tools, online exams, and text-based
   course notes to be the most useful for e-learning, whereas perceive
   online group activities and wiki pages as not useful enough. On the
   other hand, Kyrgyz learners perceive interactive materials, online
   exams, and social media tools to be the most useful for e-learning,
   whereas perceive online chats and pages as not useful enough. The
   participants' opinions cover important points for the improvement of
   current online materials. In addition, learners from Turkey and
   Kyrgyzstan showed both similarities and differences in terms of their
   preferences toward online resources, activities, and communication
   tools, which are explained through this paper.},

Journal = {CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The contributions in this special section deal with growing up in two
   post-Soviet states - Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. Each contribution has a
   different priority on the variety of forces that shape the wellbeing of
   children and youth as structured in the interaction between the efforts
   and abilities of their families, the state, as well as social and health
   policies in both national and cross-national contexts. In this special
   section, we understand infrastructure as places and institutions for
   day-care, education, leisure, social and health services. The papers
   identify barriers that children and young people encounter as they
   attempt to realize their potential and wishes in a variety of social,
   educational, and health contexts. These obstacles have something in
   common: they are rooted in a deficit of public and social infrastructure
   that is evident in these two states (European Commission, 2011;
   Sardarova, 2020; OECD, 2018; UNICEF, 2015).},

Abstract = {This article argues against scholarship that views barter and monetized

   an ethnography of small-holder mobile pastoralism in south Kazakhstan, I
   compare instances in which flock owners chose to sell sheep with
   examples of barter and explain the calculations behind each choice. In
   barter exchange, sheep replaced money as both medium of exchange and
   store of value and the material qualities of sheep meant this shift had
   profound consequences for the kinds of social relations associated with
   the transaction. In a context of chronic money shortages, barter of
   sheep freed participants from future obligations, while monetized
   exchange locked them into the most prolonged and risky of relations.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the state-building project in Kazakhstan since

   tendencies in state-building can be identified but that it is not any
   particular trajectory of nationalism in Kazakhstan that is of
   significance so much as the tensions between two very different
   trajectories. We argue that, at least to date, the government has
   succeeded in managing these tensions quite effectively both at the
   policy level and in its relations with different ethnic groups and
   neighbouring states. Whether Kazakhstan can continue to manage these
   tensions in the post-Nazarbayev era is one of the most significant
   questions facing the country.},

Abstract = {Much security-related research conducted in Central Asia appears to
   disregard the nexus between the data gathered and participants' and
   researchers' experiences of safety during the research. This article
   explores the interconnectedness of these factors and their effects on
   the knowledge produced on security. It investigates the legal and
   institutional context researchers encounter when conducting research in
   Kyrgyzstan; namely, a state monopoly over knowledge on certain subject
   matters linked to political stability and security. Furthermore, drawing
   on the combined fieldwork experience of the authors, the article
   explores the roles of cooperation, networks and framing in navigating
   the security implications of doing research. To conclude, we suggest a
   long-term and collaborative production of knowledge on security in
   Central Asia to counter the prevailing modes of knowledge production
   which lean towards epistemically violent and politically provocative
   topics.},

Title = {The Socio-Technical Aspects of Water Management: Emerging Trends at
   Grass Roots Level in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {WATER},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {In Soviet times, water management was presented generally as a technical
   issue to be taken care of by the state water bureaucracy. Due to
   structural changes in agriculture in the two decades post-independence,
   irrigation water management has become an explicitly political and
   social issue in Central Asia. With the state still heavily present in
   the regulation of agricultural production, the situation in Uzbekistan
   differs from other post-communist states. Water management strategies
   are still strongly `Soviet' in approach, regarded by state actors as
   purely `technical', because other dimensions - economic, social and
   political - are `fixed' through strong state regulation. However, new
   mechanisms are appearing in this authoritarian and technocratic
   framework. The application of a framework for socio-technical analysis
   in some selected Water Users' Associations (WUAs) in northwest
   Uzbekistan's Khorezm region shows that the WUAs are becoming arenas of
   interaction for different interest groups involved in water management.
   The socio-technical analysis of Khorezm's water management highlights
   growing social differences at grass root level in the study of WUAs. The
   process of social differentiation is in its early phases, but is still
   able to express itself fully due to the strict state control of
   agriculture and social life in general.},

Abstract = {Khorezm, a district of Uzbekistan, is a textbook example of irrigated
   agriculture in the Aral Sea Basin causing the ``Aral Sea Syndrome{''}.
   It offers an opportunity to study the complex human-environment
   relations in the context of strong government control in transformation
   economies. Agricultural production and rural livelihood in Khorezm rely
   entirely on irrigation water supply based on a dense network of
   irrigation channels and drainage collectors. Inefficient use of land and
   water resources, inadequate institutions and policies, and
   underdeveloped agro-processing and service sectors are among the key
   issues threatening the economic and ecological sustainability of the
   region. An interdisciplinary research project was initiated by the
   Center for Development Research (ZEF) of the University of Bonn,
   Germany, together with the University of Urgench to develop
   science-based concepts and tools for the restructuring of land use and
   agricultural production in order to make more efficient use of natural
   resources. Simultaneously, the project aimed to develop recommendations
   for policies and institutions to enable economic development and
   environmental sustainability. As Khorezm is representative for many
   irrigated lowlands in the Aral Sea Basin, innovative concepts and
   technologies developed in the project are expected to provide useful
   information to similar environments in Central Asia and elsewhere. This
   chapter provides the problem setting in the Aral Sea basin and Khorezm.
   The ``Khorezm Project's{''} purpose and structure are briefly described.
   An overview of the chapters in this book is then given. Conclusions are
   drawn and an outlook is presented. Technological, economic and
   institutional innovations have to go hand-in-hand if long-lasting
   sustainable development is aimed for with increased environmental and
   economic security of the region's people.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on engagement with identity documents among the
   rural Uzbek population in the borderlands of Kyrgyzstan. By exploring
   the materiality of the documents and people's concern with these
   material artefacts of bureaucracy, this article illustrates how the
   state has been moving in, out and through the lives of the people living
   on the margins of the state. People's engagement with documents
   illuminates the temporal dynamics of the state's spatialization
   practices and highlights the fluctuating presence of the state. In
   addition, this article exposes the discrepancies between the
   classificatory bureaucratic order and the changing realities of everyday
   life. Gaps between these two domains are filled with what I refer to as
   entangled documents. People's attempts to disentangle documents reveal
   how people on the margins of the state manage encounters with state
   bureaucracy and provide insight into the internal dynamics of a local
   bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {In the 1930s, luxury textiles such as silk and velvet appeared
   frequently in agitation and propaganda addressed toward women in
   Uzbekistan. After examining the cultural and material significance of
   luxury textiles for Central Asian women before collectivization, this
   article investigates how luxury textiles were used in the effort to
   mobilize Central Asian women during the years of collectivization and
   cottonization (c.1929-37). The article concludes with a close reading of
   several `textile-texts' produced by Central Asian women, focusing
   particularly on women's poetry about luxury textiles. The article argues
   that the discourse of `silk and velvet' tapped into affective resonances
   rooted in, among other conditions, the local gift economy, Central Asian
   women's material conditions, Orientalist discourses and Stakhanovite
   propaganda. The discourse of silk and velvet thus bolstered hierarchical
   relations between Central Asian women and the Party-state, while at the
   same time it generated lateral ties to a public of other Central Asian
   women. The article relies on research in a variety of archival sources
   and the Uzbek-language Soviet press, particularly the women's press.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry is often an economically viable land-use option for the
   environmental rehabilitation of salinized cropping areas in irrigated
   drylands, but afforestation initiative at the farm level is subject to
   various socio-political constraints. We analyzed the factors that affect
   farmer decisions with respect to the agroforestry adoption using an ex
   ante approach through Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling (EDTM).
   Constraints on agroforestry adoption were identified via a review of
   legal documents, focus-group discussions, and a farm survey in northwest
   Uzbekistan. The findings highlighted the importance of farmer
   perceptions of risk with respect to decision making surrounding the
   adoption of alternative land uses. The EDTM analysis allowed determining
   those policy incentives for afforestation that could directly influence
   the decision-making process of potential participants. In particular,
   there is a need for increased land-use flexibility, improved land tenure
   and tree plantation proprietorship security, increased awareness raising
   and training in agroforestry practices, and greater institutional
   support.},

Title = {Kyrgyzstan's Dordoi and Kara-Suu Bazaars: Mobility, Globalization and
   Survival in Two Central Asian Markets},
Journal = {GLOBALIZATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {643-657},
Abstract = {Despite modest economic indicators, Kyrgyzstan boasts two of Eurasia's
   largest bazaars: Dordoi bazaar in the capital city Bishkek, and Kara-Suu
   bazaar in southern Kyrgyzstan. Combined, the 2 bazaars provide
   employment to approximately 75,000 people and serve as entrepots for
   foreign merchandise into Central Asia and Russia. This paper makes three
   arguments: (i) mobility of people, merchandise, capital, and information
   became a defining feature of the two bazaars after the collapse of the
   Soviet Union; (ii) Dordoi and Kara-Suu are not static institutions, as
   bazaars were frequently considered by post-war social sciences. Instead,
   Dordoi and Kara-Suu are illustrative of Kyrgyzstan's adaptation to
   globalization through a transnational commercial web extending between
   Dubai, Guangzhou, Istanbul, Moscow, Urumchi, and smaller localities in
   between, making the bazaars uniquely globalized spaces; and (iii)
   bazaar-based trade was, and remains a critical survival mechanism given
   the dearth of other vocational opportunities after the collapse of the
   Soviet Union.},

Abstract = {Critical international relations theory has given too little attention
   to regionally specific manifestations of discourses of the `war on
   terror'. Using Richard Devetak's concept of a `gothic scene of
   international relations', this article considers the final months of the
   regime of Kyrgyzstan's former President, Askar Akaev. Akaev evoked a
   gothic fantasy of a gloomy Kyrgyzstan terrorised by monsters
   recognisable from President Bush's nightmares, peculiarly Kyrgyz
   monsters, and obscene hybrids. That America was portrayed as a monster
   by an undemocratic regime fighting a desperate rearguard action
   highlights ironies both in Devetak's theory and in the international
   relations of Central Asia. We therefore suggest that attention needs to
   be paid to a gothic geography of international relations.},

Title = {ANALYSIS OF FACTORS AFFECTING REMOTE BANKING SERVICES IN THE PROCESS OF
   BANK TRANSFORMATION IN UZBEKISTAN},
Journal = {FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1},
Number = {36},
Pages = {14-26},
Abstract = {Today, the transformation of banks requires, firstly, the establishment
   of digital banks, and secondly, the change in the activities of existing
   banking departments and the reduction of banking costs. In digital
   banks, banking services will be fully automated and self-management
   systems will be created for bank customers. In particular, today's
   demand is that as a result of the development of the digital economy,
   banks are required to serve a large number of customers not by
   increasing the number of branches, but by developing remote banking
   services. In the process of transformation of banks in Uzbekistan, due
   to the increasing availability of remote banking services on the basis
   of mobile, Internet and other banking technologies, their level of
   security, risk minimization, ease of use, importance of use, public
   awareness of these services, usefulness of services, etc. the factors
   are econometrically analyzed based on the conceptual model created by
   the author. These affect the development of remote banking services
   (customer awareness of remote banking services (As), risk of using
   remote banking services (R), ease of use of remote banking services
   (Eu), understanding the usefulness of remote banking services (Uu), cost
   of remote banking services (Cs), security in the use of remote banking
   services (Ss)) were hypothesized. In order to assess the impact of these
   hypotheses, a survey of clients of the Tashkent branch of Joint-Stock
   Commercial Bank with foreign capital ``HAMKORBANK{''} was conducted and
   the results of the survey were econometrically analyzed on the basis of
   a conceptual model created by the author. These hypotheses have also
   been studied by foreign economists and their conclusions are given. The
   results of this study are of practical importance for the development of
   remote banking services in the banking system of Uzbekistan.},

Title = {The Alien Republic: Narratives of Deterritorialization in Imaginations
   of Turkmenistan from the Late Nineteenth to the Late Twentieth Century},
Journal = {SLAVIC REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55+},
Abstract = {Turkmenistan holds a special place in the Russian and Soviet
   imagination. At the turn of the last century, especially, Turkmenistan
   appeared as an imaginative object shaped by both nineteenth century
   tropes and images of the steppe and by the modernist's revaluation and
   displacement of these very tropes. This article traces this intellectual
   history from the late nineteenth century to the fall of the Soviet
   empire and elicits three main narratives through which the republic was
   rendered alien: Turkmenistan as a ``republic from outer space,{''} as an
   ``arctic desert,{''} and as a republic whose southern border is
   constantly threatened by various forces that can never be successfully
   defeated. Based on a wide body of literary works and films, mainly from
   the 1920s-30s and the late Soviet period, the paper points to
   intertextual references that betray both shifts and continuities within
   these narratives. The analysis shows how notions of political
   integration and climatic transformations were constantly countered by
   alternative imaginary boundaries, contributing to an ``imaginative
   geography{''} of the republic that shaped the way Turkmenistan was
   perceived. The development of such an ``imaginative geography{''} of
   Turkmenistan as an ``alien republic{''} was thereby inextricably linked
   to its steppe and desert geography, marked by a threefold dialectic
   between concrete and imaginary geography, a rhetoric of appropriation
   and of alienation, and between present and mythical time.},

Title = {Significance of context, metrics and datasets in assessment of
   multidimensional energy poverty: A case study of Tajikistan},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We applied the multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) to
   Tajikistan, using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets to
   assess energy poverty at the national and sub-national levels, along the
   urban-rural gradient, and over time. The results showed very low energy
   poverty levels across the board. However, using the Khalon region
   survey, and applying the original index, we found substantially higher
   energy poverty levels. Whereas the MEPI results from DHS datasets were
   0.15 for 2012 and 0.04 for 2017 for rural areas of Khatlon, the MEPI
   result from Khatlon dataset was 0.53. This is higher by about 253\%
   against 2012 and a whopping 1225\% against 2017 estimates. Modifying the
   indicators and weights and applying this modified index to the Khatlon
   dataset showed a higher result (0.54), but still in the moderate energy
   poverty category. Furthermore, we conducted assessment at the
   sub-regional level and by access to grid electricity in both the
   original and modified indices based on the Khatlon dataset, and found
   differences ranging from 0.47 to 0.80, i.e. moderate to acute energy
   poverty. Therefore, low results found using the DHS dataset likely
   underestimate the actual state of energy poverty in Tajikistan, whereas
   the Khatlon dataset showed substantially higher energy poverty levels
   that are closer to reality. These results offer valuable insights for
   policymakers and practitioners to investigate the actual state of energy
   poverty and explore measures to address this issue. We propose eight
   recommendations for future research into energy poverty measurement,
   focusing on study design and choice of indicators.},

Abstract = {The People's Front of Tajikistan (PFT), one of the parties to the
   country's civil war, was instrumental in bringing the government of
   President Emomali Rahmon to power. The article examines the official
   strategies of memorialization of the PFT from the early 1990s to the
   present. It discusses the emergence of a canon of the PFT heroes and
   martyrs and locates it within the nascent national mythology after
   independence. It argues that the maintenance of this canon was rendered
   impossible by the imperatives of consolidating presidential authority
   and securing national reconciliation following the 1997 peace deal. It
   concludes with an examination of the growing tension between the
   official line of historical amnesia on the one hand and resurgent social
   memory on the other. People in Tajikistan are increasingly interested in
   revisiting the events and protagonists of the war to develop a sense of
   the past, and remembering the PFT forms an essential part of their
   search for shared history and a sense of identity.},

Title = {Politics or profits along the ``Silk Road{''}: what drives Chinese farms

Abstract = {China's influence in neighboring Central Asian states is growing at a
   fast pace. Since the launch of the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative
   to accelerate China's engagement in Central Asia and beyond, nearly all
   Chinese activity in this region has been gathered under OBOR. OBOR now
   seems to cover a plethora of spatially and temporally expanding state
   and privately driven projects. In this paper, I discuss large- and
   small-scale Chinese farm enterprises in Tajikistan, in which discussions
   around China's global land investments and OBOR intersect. Beneath
   abstract conceptualizations of OBOR and theChinese presence in Central
   Asia, my analysis shows that Chinese land investments in Tajikistan are
   shaped by Chinese dynamics of agrarian change and are contingent upon
   country-specific conditions. Rather than state-led endeavors as is often
   assumed, the main Chinese actors in Tajik agriculture are capitalist yet
   partially state-embedded enterprises driven by profit-oriented goals.
   Chinese farm enterprises tap into specific market demands that are
   either unanswered or underdeveloped in Tajikistan, or which have emerged
   due to the growing number of Chinese consumers in Tajikistan. The nature
   and drivers of Chinese land acquisitions in Tajikistan shed light on the
   various, sometimes competing, factors driving China's broader foreign
   land rush, in Central Asia (and beyond).},

Title = {Women's strategies for coping with the impacts of domestic violence in
   Kyrgyzstan: A grounded theory study},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {164-189},
Abstract = {This paper provides an account of the adverse impacts of domestic
   violence on women in Kyrgyzstan and develops a grounded theory of coping
   among survivors of abuse. The results indicate that women adopt a range
   of strategies to prevent, avert, and minimize anticipated violence. Two
   key aspects of coping appeared in the narratives: 1) maintaining the
   status quo and 2) developing agency to resist the abuse. The results
   suggest that Government and nongovernmental organizations must take
   additional action to draw women to formal violence prevention services.
   Providing professional help at several levels (e.g., clinical,
   community, and societal) and promoting problem-focused strategies as
   part of therapeutic intervention are essential.},

Title = {Accelerating ventures in Kazakhstan: The case of ineffective
   effectiveness in talent retention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION},
Abstract = {Accelerators play an essential role in fostering regional development by
   offering various resources to entrepreneurs and their new ventures.
   Their services are critical for entrepreneurs in developing countries.
   However, the majority of the business incubator studies are concentrated
   on developed economies, while developing countries represent an
   under-researched domain. Scholars argue that research on accelerators
   and business incubators, in general, is not theoretical and mainly
   descriptive. Using the knowledge-based view and resource-based view
   theories, this study discusses how an accelerator based in Kazakhstan, a
   developing country in Central Asia, designs its programs. Then looking
   through the cognitive evaluation theory lens and comparing 13-month
   longitudinal data, it analyses how program design impacts talent
   retention. The study adds a theoretical perspective to the
   non-theoretical domain of accelerators and business incubators by
   emphasising the role of motivation in the retention of talent. It also
   theorises about the four main steps involved in the acceleration program
   design and discusses the critical factors that shape those steps in the
   context of emerging markets.},

Abstract = {This study deals with the contemporary dynamics of urban life in
   Bishkek. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Central Asian
   societies have experienced widespread political, economic and
   socio-cultural transformations. In this context, Western or globalized
   cultural modes and trends influence Kyrgyzstan's social and cultural
   life. One of these trends is the increasingly popular coffee culture,
   with its attendant high-grade coffee brands and fancy cafes changing
   established consumption patterns. This article focuses primarily on
   cafes as new places of consumption and communication, but it also
   examines the intentions and strategies of the cafe pioneers. We reflect
   on the emergence of coffee and cafes in Bishkek and show how they have
   integrated in urban life as `third places'. Coffee is breaking away from
   its commonly soluble form and moving toward an expensive lifestyle
   product, while the new cafes offer a place for communication that has
   not existed before.},

   According to the results, these two countries with different education
   systems had significant differences in terms of the level of the
   education of the computer engineering students, their knowledge,
   awareness and attitude concerning usability and accessibility. Although
   the overall level of knowledge and awareness of the Turkish students was
   found to be higher than those of the Kyrgyz students, the computer
   engineering students in the selected Kyrgyz universities either had
   taken or were planning to take more courses on accessibility and had a
   higher level of awareness in terms of undertaking thesis and project
   work in this area. However, the results obtained from the participants
   from both countries demonstrated the need for the revision of course

Title = {Resilience against the pandemic: The impact of COVID-19 on migration and
   household welfare in Tajikistan},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have adverse effects on the economy
   through damage to migration and remittances. We use a unique monthly
   household panel dataset that covers the period both before and after the
   outbreak to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on a variety of household
   welfare outcomes in Tajikistan, where remittance inflows in recent years
   have exceeded a quarter of annual GDP. We provide several findings.
   First, after April 2020, the adverse effects of the pandemic on
   household welfare were significantly observed and were particularly
   pronounced in the second quarter of 2020. Second, in contrast to
   expectation, the pandemic had a sharp but only transitory effect on the
   stock of migrants working abroad in the spring. Some expected migrants
   were forced to remain in their home country during the border closures,
   while some incumbent migrants expecting to return were unable to do so
   and remained employed in their destination countries. Both departures
   and returns started to increase again from summer. Employment and
   remittances of the migrants quickly recovered to levels seen in previous
   years after a sharp decline in April and May. Third, regression analyses
   reveal that both migration and remittances have helped to mitigate the
   adverse economic outcomes at home during the ``with-COVID-19{''} period,
   suggesting that they served as a form of insurance. Overall, the
   unfavorable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were severe and temporary
   right after the outbreak, but households with migrants were more
   resilient against the pandemic.},

Title = {Beyond Spheres of Influence: The Myth of the State and Russia's
   Seductive Power in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {404-435},
Abstract = {This article questions the analytical value of spheres of influence for
   understanding power and the state in the post-Soviet region and beyond,
   based on a critical deconstruction of the ontological and
   epistemological assumptions inherent in the concept. It proposes an
   alternative reading of power and the state, drawing on the concept of
   seductive power at a distance and Timothy Mitchell's state effect.
   Rather than the concept of a sphere of influence, a highly politicized
   concept that conveys an ontology that flattens and divides space,
   essentializes the state, and relies on an intentionalist account of
   power, we need an analytical framework that can help us make sense of
   the multiple, varied spatialities and historical legacies that produce
   the state and power. I demonstrate this through an extended discussion
   of Russian power in Kyrgyzstan, a country often described as a Russian
   client state. Mobilizing recent re-conceptualizations of state and power
   in anthropology and political geography, I present an analysis of
   Russia's seductive power in Kyrgyzstan and the way it contributes to
   producing Kyrgyz state-ness. I also show how Russia's Great Power myth
   is itself evolving and conclude that the differentiated, relational
   production of space and power in either Kyrgyz or Russian myths of the
   state is not captured by a the concept of a return to spheres of
   influence.},

Title = {Balancing the Discussion of Benefit Sharing in Transboundary Water
   Governance: Stressing the Long-Term Costs in an Empirical Example from
   Central Asia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {19-42},
Abstract = {Internationally the benefit sharing approach is promoted to encourage
   cooperation in transboundary water governance. Costs of cooperation are
   so far under researched. Attention of few international studies is
   limited to benefit and cost sharing practices for dam projects. Here,
   the case study looks at long-term costs of cooperation in an empirical
   example from Central Asia. In the Syr Darya Basin, a compensation
   package for constructing the Toktogul Reservoir on the Naryn in upstream
   Kyrgyzstan required Uzbekistan to shift water withdrawals from small
   transboundary tributaries to the main river. The shift of water
   allocation created long-term costs for Uzbekistan. The paper highlights
   the challenges related to the originally perceived as beneficial
   compensation mechanisms (water swaps) within one basin and long-term
   cost implications. The need for revision of benefit sharing agreements
   to allow adaptation to new challenges is discussed. We stress the costs
   when existing benefit sharing arrangements are ignored whether in full
   or in part.},

Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {225-246},
Abstract = {After the Soviet collapse, the newly independent states of Central Asia
   found themselves in the process of forming their own national ``imagined
   communities.{''} This was done to legitimize their existing territorial
   integrity, their rights to their titular ethnicities, and the position
   of political elites. This process expressed itself through the creation
   of particular symbols, myths, and rituals which distinguished the nation
   but were also used to legitimize the nation's right to exist. The
   symbolic and ideological construction was influenced by the former
   Soviet era. For example, symbolically the country was still called
   Rodina (motherland), but most of the symbols of power were represented
   by male images, for example, Amir Timur in Uzbekistan or Ablay Khan in
   Kazakhstan. The tradition of representing power through a male
   connotation had a long history in Soviet Central Asia. Interestingly,
   however, some contemporary artists took an alternative view and used
   feminine images as strong, central symbols of their interpretation of
   national identity, contesting the official view of nation-building. This
   paper seeks to trace the development of the feminine and masculine
   dichotomy of representation by comparing official iconography with works
   of famous female artists such as Umida Akhmedova from Uzbekistan and
   Saule Suleimenova and Almagul Menlibayeva from Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Central Asia is hardly associated with the sea and with maritime issues,
   even though its physical geography contains two major maritime surfaces,
   namely the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. This article looks into the
   position and role of these water surfaces and their respective littorals

   empire. It explores whether they were part of a maritime consciousness
   and the notion of overseas vis-a-vis Central Asia, before looking into a
   number of developments and shifts, the outcomes or at least traces of
   which are still prevalent and visible today. More concretely, these
   include: the patterns of maritime accessibility over the Caspian and
   Aral Seas that came into being and functioned; the existence of
   seashore-shaped cultures and livelihoods; and the establishment of new
   territorialities which served as spaces for double-edged economic
   modernization, blueprints of modern national individualities, and a
   peculiar pattern of urban development.},

Title = {Risk or opportunity? The Belt and Road Initiative and the role of debt
   in the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor},
Journal = {EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {This Research Note provides an empirical contribution to the discussion
   on the debt implications vis-a-vis the unfolding of the Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI). For this purpose, we analyze the impact of external
   debt and other relevant factors on the economies of the China-Central
   Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor using panel data over the period
   1996-2018. The reasons we focus on this geographic area are threefold:
   first, these countries form a key part of the BRI with historical
   connections to the Silk Road; second, it provides a unique combination
   of economies in transition such as the former Soviet Union countries and
   larger economies such as Iran and Turkey; and last but not least, this
   corridor has received relatively less attention in the related
   literature. Among the main findings is that debt service on external
   debt has a positive effect on GNI per capita, both with and without
   China in the empirical analysis. As another key component of this major
   development strategy, infrastructure is also found to have a positive
   impact. The results thus foreshadow growing opportunities as the BRI
   unfolds, albeit with foreseen issues related to debt sustainability,
   ecological and wellbeing considerations.},

Abstract = {Research on tensions between continuity and change in the
   internationalization of higher education remains scant. The
   transformative forces generating these tensions are under-investigated.
   Using insights from interviews with 21 internationally-educated
   professors from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, this
   paper examines the roles of human agency in shaping international
   perspectives in the academic profession tran-sitioning from the Soviet
   model of university to a post-Soviet one. This paper focuses on the
   agency of academics managing the legacy-innovation tensions resulting
   from the growing influence of global science and networking. While
   international education and outreach advances research and development
   opportunities for scholars in Central Asia, professors educated abroad
   persevere in the struggle to achieve a productive balance between
   demands for local and global engagement. The human agency of
   internationalization appears to play a significant role in mitigating
   these tensions and driving the rejuvenation of the academic profession

Abstract = {The ``re-Islamization{''} of society in independent Uzbekistan has
   proven to be a complex process, generating conflict in the social,
   cultural and political spheres. Since the early 1990s, the regime of
   Islam Karimov has sought to undermine any manifestation of
   ``unofficial{''} Islam via imprisonment of the leadership,
   implementation of repressive statutes governing religious activity, and
   other coercive means. Yet, since 1999 Uzbekistan has experienced more
   religious violence directed against government power structures by
   ``extremists{''} than any other former Soviet republic in Central Asia.
   Important issues that should direct U.S. policy remain unresolved: How
   significant is the threat from radical Islam in Uzbekistan, that is,
   what are the chances of politicized, ``fundamentalist{''} Islam emerging
   as a mass movement there? Has recent U.S. policy reduced or exacerbated
   the dynamics of conflict between the regime and the ``radicals?{''} In
   order to effect resolution of this conflict, a new paradigm must be
   implemented in U.S.-Uzbek relations which moves the Uzbek regime toward
   democratization, while maintaining social stability. In addition,
   politicized Islam, in a non-radicalized form, should also figure into
   any policy strategy directed at long-term stability in Uzbekistan. (C)

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) 2019 New Strategy for Central Asia and joint
   meetings with Central Asia's five foreign ministers established
   standards and expectations for mutual relations. Throughout those
   initiatives and proclamations, the EU stresses its un-geopolitical
   essence and behaviour, including the statement that affords the
   article's title. The article identifies five issue areas that
   demonstrate that, despite declarations otherwise, the EU reasons and
   acts geopolitically in this contested region: (1) the promotion of
   Central Asian regionalism; (2) the inclusion of Central Asia in
   formations beneficial to the EU; (3) selectively in economic and
   functionalist cooperation; (4) democracy, human rights and civil society
   promotion; and (5) international education cooperation. The EU
   identifies its comparative advantage through cost-benefit analyses and
   seeks to enhance its attractiveness by offering its allies to Central
   Asia, while excluding other, present actors. That the EU is often
   outmanoeuvred does not diminish this subtle yet discernible geopolitical
   conduct.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the reliability and consistency of subjective
   well-being measures, using the Life in Transition Survey. Drawing on two
   life satisfaction questions with alternative scales, our results do not
   reveal substantial biases in accounts of life satisfaction due to
   framing. Subjective individual assessments of household relative income
   position, on the other hand, do not appear to be reliable predictors of
   objective poverty or wealth. We find that subjective relative income
   position is only weakly correlated with objective welfare measures.
   There are differences in evaluations of the household's relative
   standing across different household members, and these differences are
   correlated with respondent characteristics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the collision of two bureaucratic systems at a
   local nongovernmental organization in Kazakhstan. In response to budget
   cuts by Western donors, NGO employees decided to make it an
   international organization. At first glance, being international echoes
   neoliberal notions of the worker and workplace that clash with the
   current prikaz (decree) system, a Soviet legacy and Kazakhstani
   bureaucratic order. Through close ethnographic analysis, I ask not only
   what neoliberalism means in this context but also what its appeal is to
   local actors. Although these two systems seem at odds with each other,
   they are more fluid than they first appear. I argue that being
   international is a process of neoliberalization in which the staff draw
   on their experiences with, and the language of, their international
   donors to adapt to an unstable funding climate, while navigating the
   demands of Kazakhstani bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {Since 1991, the Eurasian republic of Kazakhstan has endeavored to build
   a recognizable and credible national brand as a resource-rich,
   multicultural, and stable outpost in an otherwise troubled region of the

   creator of the fictitious Kazakhstani reporter ``Borat Sagdiyev,{''}
   touched a raw nerve with his parody of the country and its people as
   bigoted and backward. While the Borat satire is both grotesque and
   spurious, the success of the motion picture Borat: Cultural Learnings of
   America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan has provided
   Kazakhstan with a precipitous increase in its global profile. Using the
   analytical tool of ``nation branding,{''} Robert A. Saunders discusses
   the challenges and opportunities the Borat film presented to the

Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {333-341},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a result of government decentralization and property devolution from
   central to local governments, many city governments in transition
   countries became the largest real property owners in urban areas. For
   transitional countries lacking sufficient democratic traditions,
   efficient asset management represents a dramatic and multifaceted
   challenge. Kyrgyzstan happened to be among the first transitional
   countries where cities obtained systematic technical assistance in
   adapting the most advanced methodology of municipal asset management,
   which was recently developed under the auspices of the World Bank. Based
   on experience of work within five pilot cities, the article summarizes
   factors and methods that help develop a sense of strong ownership and
   internalization of new asset management vision and approaches among
   local officials and elected members of city councils. The article
   presents the experience of how the government of Uzgen, a city of about
   40,000 people in South Kyrgyzstan, has changed its attitudes and
   approach regarding management of municipal property. The article
   demonstrates how two key processes-improving professional aspects of
   municipal asset management and developing local democracy though public
   involvement-have been reinforced by each other. One of the main lessons
   from Uzgen's experience is that municipal property asset
   management-because it deals with tangible issues-is a perfect focal
   point for developing local democracy and communication between a local
   population and its government. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Assessing agricultural systems vulnerability to climate change to inform

Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. The
   current vulnerability assessments through traditional fragmented
   sectoral methods are insufficient to capture the effects on complex
   agricultural systems. Therefore, the traditional methods need to be
   replaced by integrated approaches. The objective of this study is to
   propose a holistic vulnerability assessment method for agricultural
   systems. By aggregating both agro-ecological and socio-economic
   information, we develop an agricultural systems vulnerability index
   (ASVI) which allows for (i) a classification of geographical units
   according to their vulnerability level, (ii) an identification of key
   determinants of vulnerability for each unit and (iii) an assessment of
   adaptation policy scenarios considering their effects on the
   sustainability of the analysed systems. The proposed method is applied
   in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan-a representative irrigated
   agricultural region in the lower Amu Darya river basin. A decision
   support tool is used to facilitate multi-criteria decision analysis,
   including the computation of the index and performing sensitivity
   analysis of the results. The assessment for Khorezm reveals significant
   spatial differences of vulnerability levels due to a variation of
   contributing factors, e.g. natural resources, water productivity,
   rural-urban ratio. It reveals also that feasible land and water
   management policies could reduce the vulnerability in Khorezm,
   particularly in the districts with the poorest agro-ecological
   conditions. Overall, the proposed method could support national and
   local authorities in the identification of sustainable adaptation
   policies for the agriculture sector.},

Abstract = {With the increasing visitors' attention to the authenticity of heritage
   and tourism practices when they visit off the beaten track destinations,
   the question of authenticity in the experience of place becomes
   significant for the stakeholders involved in the management and
   development of tourism. This study investigates the managerial practices
   associated with the planning and development of authentic eco-cultural
   tourism in Kazakhstan. A qualitative case study research approach based
   on semi-structured interviews with policymakers, tourism developers and
   community members from two eco-tours in South and Central Kazakhstan is
   adopted to examine stakeholders' authentication positions on various
   topic areas and eco-cultural tourism practices. Four key managerial and
   planning implications related to stakeholders' perceptions of
   authenticity of Kazakhstani eco-cultural tourism are identified:
   empowering local communities for tourism development, redefining the
   host-guest tourism experience, certifying and labelling eco-cultural
   heritage sites and including authenticity as a unique and important
   feature in future tourism products and experiences.},

Title = {Lesson Study in Kazakhstan: case study of benefits and barriers for
   teachers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR LESSON AND LEARNING STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {250-262},
Abstract = {Purpose Shaped as an exploratory pilot case study, the purpose of this
   paper is threefold: to describe a case of how Lesson Study (LS) is
   implemented at a school in Kazakhstan; to identify if and in which ways
   teachers benefit from participating in LS and what barriers they
   encounter; and to discuss the possible implications for practice.
   Mainly, this research endeavors to produce knowledge that might serve as
   a base for further large-scale studies and interventions as well as
   inform policy makers and LS program developers and executors of the
   teachers' perspective on the quality of assistance they require and,
   thus, stimulate reflection on the possible ways to overcome existing
   barriers.
   Design/methodology/approach This research adopts qualitative paradigm
   and utilizes a pilot exploratory case study framework (Gillham, 2000).
   The data were analyzed by means of what Thomas (2003) refers to as
   general inductive approach which is intended to aid an understanding of
   meaning in complex data through the development of summary themes or
   categories from the raw data, i.e. data reduction (p. 2). The data were
   analyzed as text and reduced by means of inductive coding. The text was
   read rigorously and systematically in order to identify emerging themes
   based on the recurrence of patterns (Thomas, 2003, p. 3).
   Findings LS is a growing phenomenon in Kazakhstan which, if systemically
   supported and organized properly based on the shared understanding, has
   a great potential to make a positive impact on teachers' learning,
   knowledge sharing and collegiality as well as to become a powerful tool
   to help teachers overcome collaboratively the pressure of the nationwide
   reforms. It has profound potential to change teachers' values and
   beliefs about the effective pedagogies applicable to students' learning
   and developing skills, required in the twenty-first century.
   Research limitations/implications The research is limited by the chosen
   methodology since there is a wide criticism in the literature related to
   inability of single case studies to provide generalizable data (Yin,
   1994 in Woodside, 2010, p. 249). Another limitation, as the literature
   puts it forward, is that case studies are biased by researcher's
   perspective and tend to report what the researcher wants to find
   (Gillham, 2000, p.28 ); thus, in its core, case study is subjective.
   However, Gillham (2000) proposes how these problems could be addressed
   by means of what he calls following the principals of researcher of
   integrity who is constantly challenging and scrutinizing himself and
   detached honesty, which implies acknowledging your own place in the
   scheme of things and striving to decentre from yourself (p. 28). Thus,
   the researcher tried her best to comply with the mentioned above
   principals.
   Practical implications The findings within this research could be used
   by researchers as a starting point for in-depth studies, the case
   studies of Lesson Studies practices in specific schools or regions of
   Kazakhstan as well as by the policy makers and school leaders as a
   thought-provoking source on how to effectively structure teachers'
   professional development in schools.
   Originality/value This paper is the first academic source to shed light
   on LS as a means to in-school teachers' professional development in the
   context of Kazakhstan.},

   independence},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {430-452},
Abstract = {What would a `good' industrial policy in the realm of cotton production
   look like? This article seeks to address this question through a focus
   on reforms to the cotton sector in Kazakhstan. In contrast with
   neighbouring Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, administrators in Kazakhstan
   had widely freed the cotton sector from government control as early as
   1998. Agricultural collectives had been replaced by small private farms,
   and commercial cotton processors and traders entered the sector.
   However, in 2007, regulation tightened again and forced ginneries to use
   a complex warehouse receipt system without making sure that it was
   accepted by stakeholders and without appropriate institutions for
   implementing it in place. Moreover, it imposed financing restrictions on
   ginneries, which were major loan and input providers to farmers. In the
   following years, private producers and investors turned away from
   cotton, and cotton area and output fell substantially. We position our
   analysis in the broader debate about the right approach to industrial
   policy and argue that the cotton sector performance after 2007 shows how
   ill-designed regulation and government interference can turn a promising
   economic sector towards decline.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Pages = {297-309},
Abstract = {In this study, to capture the skewness and kurtosis detected in both
   conditional and unconditional return distributions of the stock markets
   of Kazakhstan and Russia, two versions of normal mixture GARCH models
   are employed. The data set consists of daily observations of the
   Kazakhstan and Russia stock prices, and world crude oil price, covering
   the period from 1 June 2006 through 1 March 2021. From the empirical
   results, incorporating the long memory effect on the returns not only
   provides better descriptions of dynamic behaviors of the stock market
   prices but also plays a significant role in improving a better
   understanding of the return dynamics. In addition, normal mixture models
   for time-varying volatility provide a better fit to the conditional
   densities than the usual GARCH specifications and has an important
   advantage that the conditional higher moments are time-varying. This
   implies that the volatility skews implied by normal mixture models are
   more likely to exhibit the features of risk and the direction of the
   information flow is regime-dependent. The findings of this study contain
   useful information for diverse purposes of cross-border stock market
   players such as asset allocation, portfolio management, risk management,
   and market regulations.},

   discourses in Almaty, Kazakhstan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {249-267},
Abstract = {Drawing on recent ethnographic research, this article explores key
   aspects of contemporary discourses on the bazaar trade-development nexus
   in Kazakhstan. Wholesale traders at the Bolashak Bazaar in Almaty, part
   of the Barakholka bazaar agglomeration and one of the country's largest
   markets, have forged particular practices and visions of entrepreneurial
   development over the last two decades. These have been impacted by
   state-imposed modernisation agendas and their underlying goals. Using an
   actorcentred approach, I show how trade entrepreneurs' identities and
   social representation are challenged by statist developmentalism.
   However, I argue that traders also embrace a grassroots understanding of
   what socio-economic development should be like and thereby question the
   outcomes of seemingly utopian, state-led modernisation efforts on the
   ground. Through this focus it becomes apparent that the knowledge,
   aspirations and representations of actors in terms of social change

Abstract = {In this article I describe and analyse the conditions of youth in
   post-Soviet Kazakhstan, their attitudes to work and their economic
   practices. The article argues that the post-Soviet changes, most
   importantly neo-liberal reforms and rise of consumerism, have
   transformed the conditions of youth, their attitudes to work and their
   patterns of work. First, the neo-liberal reforms and the abolition of
   the welfare state have dispossessed the majority of youth from the
   access to welfare, education and work of the Soviet era. This has
   created a huge social cleavage among already stratified youth. While the
   sons and daughters of the elite, immersed in conspicuous consumption,
   have monopolized places in universities and good jobs, the dispossessed
   youth live in dire poverty. Poverty, insecure family backgrounds, lack
   of good formal education and lack of necessary contacts marginalize
   dispossessed youth in the labour market. The economic niche available to
   them consists of menial jobs in the informal sector. In spite of their
   poverty, the dispossessed youth have a consumerist mentality. This has
   created a tension between youth and parents among the dispossessed.
   While parents ask young people to get more involved-in available
   strategies of survival, the latter, seeing a gloomy future, immerse
   themselves in the present through sex and drugs. Moreover, in order to
   survive and have minimum access to the consumerist goods and services,
   young people get involved in deviant strategies: males get involved in
   theft, drug dealing and small-scale racketeering and females in
   prostitution. This subjects them to enormous violence in prisons,
   streets and places of entertainment. The conditions of the dispossessed
   youth are characteristic of the post-Soviet changes. While a tiny elite
   and their foreign partners plunder resources, the dispossessed majority
   are struck by despair and poverty.},

Journal = {SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {827-842},

Abstract = {Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, this article analyses the
   recent phenomenon of the mass search for Russian citizenship by
   Tajikistani nationals and critically engages with the emerging concept
   of strategic citizenship. Bringing together the literature on strategic
   citizenship and affective documents, it argues that the notion of
   strategy is incomplete and can be misleading when used to analyse
   citizenship seeking. Drawing an opposition between `rational' and
   `emotional' aspects of citizenship, there is a danger in looking at
   strategising through the assumptions grounded in formal rationality
   placing a rational individual seeking to `maximise utility' through
   their citizenship choices at the centre of analysis. My ethnography
   shows that grounded in the local systems of value, practices of
   citizenship-seeking go far beyond the calculative logic of cost-benefit
   analysis and should be theorised in the context of family projects and
   subsequent ideas about social becoming. It also shows that acts of
   taking citizenship emerge as affective responses of people trying to
   figure out what is the `rational' thing to do in the context of
   uncertainty and instability of labour markets, mobility regulations and
   documentary regimes, affects being distributed not only in persons and
   their relations but in and around documents.},

Title = {Potential risk of soil salinization in different regions of Central Asia
   with special reference to salt reserves in deep layers of soils},
Journal = {SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},
Pages = {634-649},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To analyze the potential risk of secondary soil salinization along with
   the development of irrigation agriculture, an extensive soil survey was
   conducted with special reference to the salt concentration in deeper
   layers of soils in different regions of Central Asia (Kazakhstan and
   Uzbekistan). In total, 41 soil profiles from different scales of
   distance, that is, from within respective farms to over different
   countries, were analyzed for soluble salt contents and particle size
   distribution. A regional trend was found in terms of the contents of
   soluble salts in the 100-200 cm layers of soils, which is considered to
   represent a potential risk of secondary soil salinization. The detailed
   findings were as follows. In the Ili watershed, the contents of soluble
   cations tended to be low. In the Fergana regions, the contents of
   soluble cations and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were relatively low,
   but increased in the lower watershed of the Syr-Darya River. It is
   considered, on a geochemical scale, that the most mobile species, such
   as Na+ and Cl-, tend to be removed from the upper regions and
   concentrated in the lower watershed. In northern Kazakhstan, soluble
   cations were usually high in subsoils with a high proportion of Na.
   These salts were considered to be derived from fluvial deposits that
   extensively cover this region. Therefore, although rainfed agriculture
   is most common in this area, the risk of secondary salinization is high
   with the introduction of irrigation agriculture in the future. Thus, the
   salt contents in deep soil layers are primarily determined by
   geochemical factors, with the accessory factors of soil texture and
   topography (or water regimes) affecting the salinization risk in certain
   regions. In contrast to non-irrigated conditions, under irrigated
   conditions, the upper layers of soils usually accumulate higher
   concentrations of soluble cations compared to the 100-200 cm or even
   deeper soil layers, and as a result SAR increases, indicating a process
   of secondary soil salinization. There is a higher fundamental risk (i.e.
   by geochemical factors) for secondary salinization in the lower
   watershed of the Syr-Darya River and in northern Kazakhstan than in the
   alluvial fans, such as the Ili and Fergana basins. For sustainable
   maintenance of irrigation agriculture, further extension in the lower
   watershed of large rivers should be reconsidered.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan has ambitious plans to become one of the top 30 developed
   countries in the world by 2050. Its most recent route map to achieve
   this is the Plan for the Nation: 100 Concrete Steps, announced by the
   president in May 2015. A key pillar in this reform agenda is the
   development of a professional civil service. This article considers
   whether civil service reforms to date and those envisaged under the new
   plan offer a trajectory to the 2050 stated goal. It finds that despite
   significant political endorsement at the highest level, reforms have
   focused on institutional, structural and legal changes without the
   necessary attention to how these will impact on the quality of public
   services provision. The article highlights the interdependence between
   civil service reforms and an outcomes-based approach and adapts the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Better Life
   framework for Kazakhstan as a way of making this connection. Points for
   practitioners Moving to an outcomes-based approach in a developing
   country challenges practitioners to focus on the impact of their work
   and to be judicious and context-specific in the selection of results

Abstract = {The imperative of project sustainability has become explicit policy
   within development. This is especially true for technology transfer:
   `development objects' are to be used by prospective beneficiaries long
   after the project's closure. We argue that the link between project
   sustainability, technology and `success' requires deeper scrutiny. We
   investigate a community-based project in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan, which
   included the transfer of smartphones, weather stations and camera traps.
   Upon the project's closure, we compare the stakeholders' viewpoints
   regarding the future use of the equipment, showing how technological
   objects attract new actors into the project's network, change its course
   and enhance its impact. We use actor-network theory to explain how
   development objects shape development processes by generating own
   networks and transforming social relations of power. We propose a
   dynamic view of sustainability as: (i) continuation of delivery of
   project's goods and services, (ii) durability of the achieved changes
   and (iii) feasibility of independent growth..},

Abstract = {An academic interest in the topic of digital economy is caused by the
   ever increasing digital technology possibilities as a new production
   factor. In digital production, added value is obtained as a result of
   information procession using digital technology, the final products of
   which are new products and services. Digital economy contributes to the
   rethinking of existing economic relations and formation of new pure
   digital economy sectors as the basis for a new information economy.
   In this paper, we analyze theoretical aspects of the evolution of the
   ``digital economy{''} concept; examine various scientific and expert
   opinions and views on current issues. The authors' approach to the
   definition of ``digital economy{''} concept follows from the economic
   theory of ``productive forces and production relations,{''} and is based
   on the premise of ``new production relations{''}.
   This paper critically rethinks the state of digitalization in
   Kazakhstan, the implementation of the Digital Kazakhstan Program, which
   really showed the impact of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic on
   digitalization, especially within healthcare, education, and public
   administration.
   The results of the study suggest that at present, digital knowledge and
   digital literacy skills are becoming an urgent need for most citizens to
   improve their efficiency of work and the employee qualification. A
   comparative analysis of the digital economy's development level across
   leading and developing countries has shown a number of significant
   factors that hinder digitalization in Kazakhstan, such as the lack of a
   fullfledged digital infrastructure (IT capacity, limited technological
   capabilities, etc.).
   As a result of the study, we have determined a lag in both
   implementation of digital communication technologies and development of
   digital business in Kazakhstan. Simulation results show that the
   effective digital economy development in Kazakhstan requires ensuring a
   positive dynamics of such key digital growth indicators, as the
   availability of digital communication technologies and the volumes of
   digital business, which have a positive correlation with the development
   of digital literacy, and the level of e-government.
   Mathematical methods we used in writing this paper have allowed us to
   develop a predictive model of the digital economy development in
   Kazakhstan in the medium term. We have made specific conclusions and
   recommendations for the development of the digital economy in Kazakhstan
   for the near future.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Legal debates among Kazakh nomads and on the Kazakh steppe more broadly
   have, for the most part, addressed the effects of Russian colonial
   policy on the administration of law among these nomads. The official and
   scholarly Russian fixation on Kazakh customary law, based largely on a
   tendentious categorization of Kazakh Muslims as quasi-shamanists,
   resulted in policies designed to separate Islamic law (shari'a) from
   customary law ('adat), and to suppress the role of shari'a in the areas
   of criminal and civil law. As Muslims, however, Kazakh nomads were
   directly affected by shari'a debates taking place both among Tatar
   scholars in their midst as well as among Kazakh scholars. These
   discussions, which occurred largely outside the field of vision of
   Russian officials or officially-mandated customary law courts, have so
   far eluded scrutiny. Recorded primarily in recently-published
   biographical dictionaries of Muslim scholars on the steppe, these
   discussions addressed a range of issues, including questions of ritual,
   but also, more significantly, the application of Islamic legal norms to
   commercial matters.},

Abstract = {There is a distinct lack of building design literature specific to the
   Central Asian region. This perhaps, could be one of the reasons for
   insignificant improvements in new building design and construction, even
   despite huge investment in the construction of new buildings in, for
   example, Astana, Kazakhstan. The absence of low-energy building design
   guidelines could lead to adverse internal conditions and skyrocketing
   energy bills. In the present context, low-energy buildings refer to
   buildings that are inherently low-energy consuming by careful passive
   design, by utilizing intelligent building technologies to automate
   building services, by minimizing wastage of energy, and by incorporating
   renewable technologies for its energy supply. This paper focuses on the
   low-energy design of buildings for harsh weather conditions that prevail
   in Astana, Kazakhstan. The main aspects of low-energy design are
   critically discussed. A case study for Dostar residential complex in
   Astana is presented. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is used
   to demonstrate the effect of important aspects of passive design, such
   as building orientation, configuration, and envelope on energy
   efficiency and wind comfort in Dostar residential complex in Astana. The
   results indicated that there is a considerable influence of low-energy
   building design on energy efficiency, wind comfort, and safety. Based on
   the findings of this study, it is suggested that a multiple buildings
   configuration (a box-shaped form in this case) rather than a
   single-standing building should be considered while designing future
   housing developments in Kazakhstan.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in Central Asia. The
   country has a significant renewable energy potential from solar, wind,
   hydro and biomass. Despite this, very small amounts of alternative
   energy sources have been used. Renewable sources such as wind, solar,
   small hydro and bioenergy currently contribute less than 1\% of the
   country's energy mix. The building sector in Kazakhstan accounts for
   30\% of final energy consumption. In this regard, the role of the
   construction industry is extremely important due to its significant
   share in energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper presents
   the results of the development of Kazakhstan's Building Sustainability
   Assessment framework. Stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA)
   method was employed to calculate and allocate weights of assessment
   categories and indicators in the assessment framework. The reliability
   of the developed framework was validated by comparing its performance
   sensitivity with fours rating systems, namely, BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, and
   SBTool for the categories of the proposed framework. The output of the
   research can produce a useful reference to the green building
   policymakers in the country. Also, the proposed framework can be adapted
   for use in Kazakhstan's neighboring countries which share similar
   climatic zones and conditions.},

Title = {Urbanization in Kazakhstan: desirable cities, unaffordable housing, and
   the missing rental market},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {135-166},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan's cities are hubs of economic opportunity and prosperity. But
   despite the Government's ambitious targets, the pace of urbanization
   remains slow. This study focuses on two key constraints: (i) the very
   high cost-of-living in Kazakhstan's cities, and (ii) the near absence of
   a rental housing market outside of the capital, Nur-Sultan. The findings
   show that the two urban centres of Almaty and Nur-Sultan are 190\% and
   240\% more expensive to live in than the national average. Housing is
   the primary driver of the disparity: after adjusting for inflation,
   housing costs tripled in Nur-Sultan and quadrupled in Almaty between
   2001 and 2015. As a result, housing costs for the local population in
   these areas are more unaffordable than famously exclusive cities such as
   San Francisco and Vancouver. Demand elasticities imply that rural and
   low-income households are especially unlikely to relocate to high-priced
   areas where employment prospects are better and average incomes are
   higher. Regional convergence in wage rates remains slow but appears to
   be proceeding most quickly in Nur-Sultan, where rental housing is most
   prevalent. The findings suggest that high rates of home ownership and
   the high cost-of-living in cities lead to exclusion of lower-income
   households and restrains economic growth.
   Highlights
   Urbanization in Kazakhstan is proceeding very slowly, despite ambitious
   government targets.
   The high cost-of-living in the urban areas of Nur-Sultan and Almaty
   deters many potential domestic migrants.
   This is driven almost entirely by housing costs: housing in high-demand
   cities is seriously unaffordable for most people, even among those
   already living in cities.
   High home ownership rates and an abnormally small rental market further
   reduce domestic mobility.},

Abstract = {This article offers a constructive critique of the Copenhagen School's
   `securitization' framework by applying it in an analysis of the role of
   international organizations seeking to counter the trafficking of
   narcotics and persons in post-Soviet Central Asia. The study discovers
   common and divergent motivations that explain international attempts and
   failures to securitize. In the case of human trafficking, significant
   clashes created obstacles to international efforts. In both cases,
   international organizations advanced their agendas through the language
   of security, but also through institutional changes and increased
   resource allocation. These processes led to the adoption of mostly
   traditional security strategies. The analysis concludes that although
   the securitization framework makes significant contributions as an
   analytical tool, its definition is too vague and it is too narrow in
   focus. `Security dichotomies' need to be taken into account in a
   comprehensive analysis of why international attempts to securitize
   issues sometimes succeed and sometimes fail. The influence of rhetoric
   on the development of policy should also be taken into account if the
   securitization framework is to provide a complete understanding of the
   issues or be useful for policymakers.},

   Following the end of the Tajik Civil War (1992-1997), moreover, these
   links have only grown, leading to a current situation in which
   Tajikistan's and Russia's security services operate in close
   coordination. As a result, the Tajik state remains bound in a semblance
   of a centre-periphery relationship not dissimilar from what it
   experienced before 1991.},

Title = {DETERMINANTS OF WATER CONSUMPTION IN TOURISM LODGING SECTOR. THE CASE OF
   KAZAKHSTAN},
Journal = {TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT-CROATIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-98},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Purpose - The main purpose of the paper is to identify, define and
   analyze the main variables that determine water consumption in the
   lodging industry, which usually accounts, on average, between the 6\%
   and 10\% of total operational costs.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The research is based on a survey
   questionnaire distributed among lodging managers in summer 2016 in the
   Shchuchinsk-Burabay resort area (Kazakhstan). The regression model
   methodology has been used to determine the main drivers of water
   consumption in the tourism lodging facilities.
   Findings - The estimations obtained in the regression model reveal that
   the main determinants of water consumption are the total area of the
   lodging facility, the pool sizes, the type of accommodation (with a
   special attention to the sanatoriums sector) and the type of board
   offered. Our study also concludes that the implementation of water
   saving initiatives significantly reduces water consumption levels and
   constitutes an effective tool to minimize lodging water consumption.
   These results can be useful both for policy makers and accommodation
   managers to develop water management policies to guarantee water, both
   in quantity and quality, both for the resident population and for the
   tourism sector.
   Originality of research - The study extends the geographical scope of
   research in tourism-water nexus by focusing on the case of emerging
   tourist destination, such as Kazakhstan.},

   examine how these groups ethnically frame, or `ethnicize', the topic of
   domestic violence, its victims and perpetrators, as well as its root
   causes and possible remedies. From explaining away ineffective policing
   to blaming past imperialism, I show how ethnicizing violence has
   political significance for these different stakeholders, whose
   assertions about gender behaviour and the function of the law compete
   with one another in a multi-ethnic state's transition from communism. I
   also discuss not only how these disparate identity positionings serve as
   local explanations and/or solutions, but also how they may inevitably
   contribute to concealing the problem.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a bottom-up ``nexus medium{''} perspective to
   examine and understand social organization and how socio-ecological
   challenges in remote rural regions are dealt with in communities that
   receive only limited external support. While ``nexus mediums{''}
   constitute substances, matter, or objects that combine manifold vital
   meanings and can be seen as socially constructed and materialized arenas
   of social interaction, autonomous resource management is seen as a means
   of local social organization. Taking water as the nexus medium of choice
   allows us to generate locally informed insights about the role of this
   scarce resource for the everyday life and social organization of
   communities inhabiting arid rural areas. This reasoning will be
   exemplified by three local case studies conducted during empirical
   research in the Pamirs of Tajikistan utilizing a mix of qualitative
   methods. The findings reveal how many fundamental everyday-life-related
   aspects and activities of the studied communities are related to water,
   and how these communities are organized around common water use and
   management arrangements that are based on joint decision-making, shared
   benefits and responsibilities, and collaborative action. The ``nexus
   medium{''} concept appears to be an appropriate approach for research
   that seeks to understand from a local perspective how communal living is
   organized and how socio-ecological challenges are addressed.},

   discrimination towards people living with HIV (PLWH) in needle and
   syringe programs (NSPs) in Kazakhstan to help inform HIV care
   interventions in these settings. Method: We collected data on HIV/AIDS
   attitudes using a modified Health Policy Project Standardized Brief
   Questionnaire with two subscales: attitudes within the health facility
   environment in a facility caring for PLWH, and opinions about PLWH.
   Results: Outreach workers were significantly more likely than nurses to
   report health professionals disparaging PLWH, and having stigmatizing
   attitudes towards PLWH. Outreach workers LWH were significantly more
   likely to report HIV discrimination in the NSP, and male staff was
   significantly more likely to have negative opinions of PLWH.
   Conclusions: Assessing different staff attitudes of nurses versus
   outreach workers, male versus female staff, and HIV positive versus
   negative staff and conducting follow-up training may decrease stigma and
   improve attendance at harm reduction programs.},

Title = {Problems and Perspectives of Transition to the Knowledge-Based Economy
   in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1088-1125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite of the highest level of the gross domestic product (GDP) per
   capita in the Central Asian region, Kazakhstan, with its long history of
   centralized planning, constantly experiences economic insecurities. This
   trend is mainly explained by the over-reliance on the natural resources
   and failures in economic diversification. Therefore, this paper
   considers the knowledge-based economy (KBE) as the framework for the
   long-term sustainable development of Kazakhstan and explores problems
   and perspectives of it from the 1996 to 2014. Methodology of the study
   includes quantitative research by using four steps analyses, such as
   principal component analysis (PCA), descriptive analysis, multiple
   linear regression (MLR), and paired t-test. The study shows that 83\% of
   the GDP growth variations in the model can be explained by the final KBE
   indicators such as Control of corruption; Enrollment in general
   secondary schools; Computer, communications, and other services; and
   Research and Development (R\&D) expenditure. Although Kazakhstan had
   poor support of KBE indicators and still practices extractive national
   institutions, the recent Third Economic Modernization is expected to
   boost the KBE in the country. The main recommendation of the paper is to
   profoundly diversify the country's economy towards enhancing the four
   pillars of the KBE, such as promoting favorable general enabling
   environment, improvement of education sector and skills of workforce,
   and enhancement of information infrastructure and innovation sectors.},

   Tajikistan on education and labor market outcomes twenty years after the
   end of the civil war. We compare individuals who should have completed
   their mandatory schooling before the war and individuals who were of
   school age during the war with a wide variety of geographical exposures
   to the war. We confirm a negative and significant effect on completing
   basic education for females exposed to the war during their school ages.
   Moreover, we see significant adverse effects on work status for

Title = {Food waste and its management in restaurants of a transition economy: An
   exploratory study of Uzbekistan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {25-35},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Food waste in the global foodservice sector is a major societal
   challenge but its estimates lack accu-racy, especially in developing and
   transition economies. The lack of accurate estimates in these emerg-ing
   markets of out-of-home food consumption hinders effective food waste
   prevention. This paper em-ploys a multi-stage research design to
   benchmark food waste in the commercial foodservice sector of Uzbekistan,
   a major transition economy and the most populous country in Central
   Asia. Primary data are obtained by analysing waste collection records,
   via in-situ observations and through managerial in-terviews. The study
   finds that food waste is correlated with size of casual dining
   restaurants in Uzbek -istan as follows: small restaurants waste 3-7
   tonnes of food per year, medium-sized restaurants - 10- 23 tonnes and
   large restaurants - 20-30 tonnes. Most food waste occurs in the kitchen
   due to over-production of meals driven by demand seasonality. Plate
   waste is significant, especially during social events. Such advanced
   approaches to food waste management as portion control, surplus food
   dona-tion and food waste resell to farmers are identified. These
   approaches can be particularly effective in non-capital, provincial
   regions. The study results can aid in the design of policy-making
   interventions for food waste prevention in the commercial foodservice
   sector of Uzbekistan and the wider region of Central Asia. (C) 2021

   the Shurkul Lake Landscape in Khorezm, Uzbekistan},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Transformation of the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan from forested to
   agricultural landscapes resulted in the formation of hundreds of lakes,
   the dynamics of which are largely controlled by inputs from irrigation
   runoff waters. The importance of the ecological and socio-cultural
   dimensions of one of these lakes, Shurkul, is discussed in order to
   understand the connection between humans and their environment.
   Landscape is used as a boundary concept, and we combine quantitative
   methods of the natural sciences with qualitative methods of the social
   sciences to assess these dimensions of the lake landscape. In the
   ecological dimension, Shurkul performs a wide range of ecosystem
   services from wildlife habitat and foodweb support to the provision of
   fish, fodder, building material and grazing ground. In the
   socio-cultural dimension, the lake is part of local ecological
   knowledge, functions as a prestige object and recreational site, and is
   rooted in religious beliefs of the population as a symbol of God's
   benevolence. The Shurkul landscape may thus create a feeling of
   environmental connectedness and the desire to act in favor of the
   natural environment, which could be made use of in environmental
   education programs.},

Abstract = {The article examines the issues surrounding tourist activity and social
   interest in agritourism among residents of the main cities in
   Kazakhstan. Based on the survey results among a group of n = 577
   respondents, the article inspected the extent of their participation in
   rural tourism, including agritourism, as well as their preferences and
   expectations regarding the type and extent of services offered on
   tourist farms. Research results show that the interest of city residents
   in using agritourism farm services is limited despite of a generally
   positive attitude towards rural tourism. Potential tourists'
   expectations of agritourism farm services focus primarily on the quality
   of accommodations and the sanitary conditions present in the facilities
   providing them. Domestic tourists especially expect to be able to take
   advantage of natural products with medicinal and cosmetic properties.
   They view active forms of leisure as a mere supplement. The respondents'
   opinions and assessments can determine the ways agritourism farms adapt
   to this clientele as well as impact organisational decisions and
   strategic planning of rural tourism in the country.},

Abstract = {Soon after independence, Kazakhstan established the state-sponsored
   student mobility programme Bolashak', which has since provided almost
   12,000 young people with full scholarships for their studies abroad.
   Bolashak is considered here as a multidimensional tool, promoting
   development and channelling authoritarian rule at the same time. Through
   a series of qualitative interviews with alumni of the programme, this
   paper investigates the authoritarian and paternalistic features in
   Bolashak-related policies and discourses, looking at how they contribute
   to the three pillars' of authoritarian stability: repression,
   co-optation and legitimation. The findings of this paper question the
   assumption that globalization is bringing only challenges to
   autocracies. Kazakhstan is an example of how contemporary authoritarian
   regimes may open up to the world in order to seek development as well as
   political stability.},

   Agricultural Area, Shengeldy-Kazakhstan},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Ongoing water-resource depletion is a common trend in southeastern
   Kazakhstan and in most of Central Asia, making the use of drainage water
   for freshwater preservation and groundwater recharge a key strategy for
   sustainable agriculture. Since the Ily River inflow began to decrease,
   groundwater levels in the Shengeldy study area site have fallen below
   the drainage pipes. As such, our main research hypothesis was that owing
   to drainage infiltration, the regional shallow aquifer can be used as an
   effective additional water source for moistening crop root systems
   during the irrigation period. The MODFLOW groundwater flow model was
   used to simulate and quantitatively assess the combined hydrogeological
   and irrigation conditions of artificial groundwater recharge both from
   the subsurface drainage and as an additional source for irrigation. The
   field study showed that the additional groundwater table elevation will
   reach approximately 1.5 m under the field drainage system and that the
   additional groundwater recharge influence zone will develop up to
   300-350 m from the drains. The MODFLOW simulation together with
   full-scale experimental studies suggests that under certain conditions
   drainage water can be applied both as an additional source of irrigation
   and for aquifer sustainable maintenance.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {13},

Abstract = {This comparative study uses the legacy effect of the Soviet past to
   explain the changes in public capital budgeting and management in the
   three former Soviet republics: Russian Federation, Moldova, and
   Uzbekistan. The main argument is that the legacy of the Soviet planning
   and budgeting traditions in forms of the centralized control, inadequate
   capital planning, and strong informal powers of political elites are
   embedded in the capital budgeting and management practices of the case
   countries. The analysis reveals that regardless of the differences in
   the countries' socio-economic characteristics, political regimes, and
   institutional developments, the budgetary outcomes are consistently
   shaped by the public management principles rooted in the Soviet
   budgeting traditions. The study findings are significant to the field of
   International Public Administration, Post-Soviet Affairs, and Public
   Finance because they disclose the legacy effect of the Soviet practices
   on the implementation of public administration reforms in post-communist
   countries. By exploring areas in international public capital budgeting
   and investments, this study also attempts to address the gap identified
   by public finance scholars.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the continuing influence of Soviet institutional
   legacies on police corruption in present-day Kazakhstan. Several
   conclusions are drawn from a qualitative analysis that featured
   semi-structured interviews with officials, drug entrepreneurs and other
   relevant actors, participant and nonparticipant observations, and
   qualitative content analysis of mass media reports and archival data.
   After Kazakhstan's most senior political leaders recognized the urgency
   of anti-corruption reforms, many legal and institutional measures
   against drug-related corruption were introduced. These measures,
   however, did not fully produce the anticipated results. Data presented
   here indicate the causal effects of institutional legacies of the
   criminal justice system. Inherited from the Soviet era, these
   institutions continue to provide incentives for corrupt police officers
   from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to manipulate the legislation
   against heroin and marijuana trafficking. More importantly, the same
   informal institutional incentives seem to hinder the enforcement of
   newly introduced anti-corruption legislation.},

Abstract = {The article proposes the Hirschman's model of studying the changes in
   the Russian Diaspora's perception of Kazakhstan as their new host-state.
   After the demise of the Soviet Union, their responses to decline of
   their political, social and cultural status varied from voicing
   discontent to exiting and loyalty throughout the non-Russian former
   Soviet republics, where they found themselves living in a new political
   reality. Not surprisingly their observable public sentiment went through
   a variety of negative expressions, such as confusion, desperation and
   even feelings of betrayal resulting from the need to learn new national
   languages and adapt to emerging nationalizing policies and practices of
   their new host-states. Many Russian people perceived the unexpected
   collapse of their common Soviet homeland as a personal drama, and some
   of these continue to identify more as countrymen of Russia rather than
   their homeland. This has become and will remain the main source of
   emigration aspirations among Russian Diasporas living in the former
   Soviet republics. The article draws upon the case of the Russian
   Diaspora living in Kazakhstan, where, even after three decades of
   national independence, many Russians still remain confused and too aloof
   to actively participate in the political and social life of the country.},

   demographically advanced and that also found itself most politically and
   economically vulnerable. While ethnic differences in the probability of
   second and third births were generally more pronounced than in the
   probabilities of first birth, the pace of their post-Soviet decline was

Title = {English high-stakes testing and constructing the `international' in
   Kazakhstan and Mongolia},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS REVIEW},
Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the role of high-stakes testing in mediating
   access to English in two Central Asian contexts where English is
   increasingly important not just in terms of mobility, but in identity
   construction on an individual and national level. We argue that in these
   contexts, English is increasingly constructed not only as a global
   language but the global language, which also has important implications
   for determining what counts as an `internationalized space' or
   `internationalized person', and as part of national strategies intended
   to make Kazakhstan and Mongolia more international. High-stakes tests
   like IELTS and TOEFL act as a focal point due to the role of these tests
   in verifying and `converting' English ability into a quantifiable,
   transportable figure. We draw on a survey about test-takers' experiences
   and practices concerning IELTS and TOEFL as well as interview data about
   the role and significance of English. Since access to knowledge and
   preparation for these tests is not evenly distributed across the
   population, our work provides evidence that some people may be in a more
   advantageous position to succeed on and benefit from high-stakes testing
   than others. Previous research on IELTS/TOEFL has largely focused on
   washback effects on school curriculums, test reliability, and strategies
   for test preparation, while research on globalization needs to continue
   to engage with specific mechanisms of how scales and hierarchies are
   created and maintained. We bridge this gap by considering how success or
   failure on IELTS/TOEFL becomes internalized as a quality of the
   individual and a reflection of their abilities, dedication and
   cosmopolitanism, and how testing contributes to carving out particular
   `international' spaces. This paper will focus on how English comes to be
   conflated at least in some cases with being international, and how
   individuals make sense of high-stakes testing as a way of accessing an
   `international' scale which may or may not involve literal movement
   abroad.},

Abstract = {The research aims to assess the impact of information and communication
   technology (ICT) on economic growth in different regions of Kazakhstan.
   A few basic complex methods, such as systematisation of statistical data
   and regression analysis, conducted using the STATA software package,
   were used to analyse the relationship of indicators in different
   periods. Based on data for the period 2007-2018 obtained from the World
   Bank, the International Telecommunication Union and statistical yearbook
   of Kazakhstan, we assess how ICT, expressed by such indicators as
   Internet access in organisations, the number of computers and fixed
   telephones, influences economic growth. Our analysis revealed
   differences in the speed of implementation and development of ICT
   depending on the region, meaning that the least developed territories
   still lag in the number of Internet users. We have concluded that since
   2014, the country's currency has weakened due to the decrease in the
   cost of oil and consequent economic decline; mobile devices are
   increasingly used, reducing the demand for fixed telephones; computers
   in organisations are affecting economic growth in more developed regions
   since 2014, although the negative effect of Internet access is growing,
   as the model shows. The obtained results can used for strategy
   development to compare economic growth in regions with low, medium, and
   high development rates.},

Journal = {TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {165-178},
Abstract = {Climate aridization and increased anthropogenic pressure pose a severe
   threat to natural vegetation, including coastal plant communities.
   `those located in river basins of the desert zone of Central Asia are
   among the most vulnerable. Of the variety of ecosystems of the
   Ili-Balkhash region of Kazakhstan, forests dominated by a rare relict
   species Populus pruinosa Schrenk are of particular concern. This species
   occupies a very narrow ecological niche associated with river banks of
   the arid zone, which makes it very vulnerable to adverse natural and
   anthropogenic factors. The main objective of the research conducted was
   to fill the knowledge gap related to the species diversity of plant
   communities with the participation of Populus pruinosa. Another goal was
   to compare the results with the available data on the flora of similar
   communities from other Kazakh regions. The project has identified 98
   plant species belonging to 34 families and 82 genera. Among them were
   four species of trees (4\%), ten shrubs (10\%), one species of lianas
   (1\%), and the rest were herbs among which annuals dominated (44
   species, or 45\%). The flora contained endemic species from the Southern
   Balkhash region: Berberis iliensis, Rosa silverhielmii, Prangos
   arenaria, and Tulipa behmiana. Three species (Tulipa kolpakowskiana,
   Berberis iliensis, and Populus pruinosa) were listed in the Red Book of
   Kazakhstan. A significant proportion of weeds (32\%) indicated a high
   level of anthropogenic impact on coastal communities (primarily
   unsystematic cattle grazing). When compared with similar plant
   communities in Kazakhstan, the species composition was similar in terms
   of quality indicators, but different in its quantitative
   characteristics. The results may be used for subsequent monitoring of
   ecosystems with the participation of Populus pruinosa in the
   Ili-Balkhash region.},

Abstract = {Purpose Based on the tenets of the conservation of resources (COR)
   theory, this study investigated the influence of different leadership
   styles on organizational performance in the context of a Eurasian
   country (i.e. Kazakhstan). It further examined the moderating role of
   corporate culture in the leadership-organizational performance
   relationship. Design/methodology/approach Using the quantitative survey
   method, the study collected data from 321 managerial employees working
   in local and multinational corporations in Kazakhstan. The collected
   data were analysed using SPSS software, and factor analysis, path
   analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were conducted to validate
   the hypotheses. Furthermore, structural equation modelling was developed
   to assess the moderating effects of the variables. Findings The findings
   reveal that among different leadership styles, transformational,
   transactional and paternal leadership have higher influences on
   organizational performance. Among different corporate cultures, clan
   culture appears to have higher moderating effects on the
   leadership-organizational performance relationship. The moderating role
   of corporate culture on the leadership influence-organizational
   performance relationship supports the ``resource caravan{''} effects of
   the composition model theory. Originality/value The study adopts the COR
   theory by considering leadership competencies as unique resources of
   individual managers, which suggests the development of an ``integrated
   leadership approach{''} for better management development and improved
   organizational performance. Furthermore, the study contributes by
   validating the applicability of the ``conservation of resources{''} and
   the ``composition model{''} theories in leadership studies.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The study explores factors affecting workplace-mentoring
   relationships of young female faculty members and their department
   chairs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author used a qualitative interview
   research design to answer the research questions of the study.
   Semi-structured interviews of ten female faculty members from
   Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan were analyzed with the help of thematic coding
   and its interpretation.
   Findings - The study suggests implementing women-only formal mentorship
   programs with Kochan's (2013) cultural framework for an organizational
   culture change. The reason is that study provides some insights into the
   traditional values that underpin age and gender biases in the
   professional community of Kazakhstani academia. However, but the results
   differ for participants who are informally mentored by department chairs
   with modern values. The author acknowledges that the small sample limits
   the findings and it's interpretation. Hence more research in the
   interdisciplinary field of gender, education and workforce in the
   context is required.
   Originality/value - The study presents new evidence to support existing
   Western research on factors influencing workplace relationships and
   mentorship for young female faculty members. This empirical research
   adds on findings to the existing data from the Central Asian context,
   particularly to the sector of women studies and organizational culture
   in higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Kazakhstan, as in the other
   Central Asian republics, significant changes in both the water and
   agricultural sectors have emerged; water management shifted from a
   purely technical issue to a sociopolitical and economic one leading to
   several institutional and organizational changes. To address this
   transitional context and its issues, since the 1990s international
   donors have supported the establishment of Irrigation Management
   Transfer (IMT) and the Water Users Associations (WUAs), both initiatives
   sponsored and related to the IWRM framework. This paper discusses these
   processes in the South-Kazakhstan Province, 10 years since the enactment
   of the law formalizing WUAs; three districts were selected for the
   analysis. The paper concludes that the IMT has been implemented in
   different and ambiguous methods and times, reflecting specific district
   dynamics and issues; furthermore, government support of IMT has
   decreased, leading to unexpected changes in its role in local water
   management and a reconsideration of the future scenario.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the nexus of minority group, `host-state' and
   `homeland' as well as exploring the organization of the German minority
   in Kazakhstan and how it is linked to the objectives of the two states.
   In this endeavour, the article takes a perspective from below and shows
   how people not only cope with contradictory, state policies, but also
   how they creatively use state-given conditions for their own purposes.
   Though the Kazakhstani Germans, at a first glance, seem to comply with
   the ascribed role of being a minority within Kazakhstan. their
   activities often run contrary to the intended Outcomes of the two
   states' policies. The article focuses on ethnographic descriptions while
   embedding them in a broader discussion of nationality policies. The data
   presented here is based oil a year-long fieldwork on the topic of German
   identity, which was conducted in the city of Tekmok, Kazakhstan in
   2006-2007.},

Title = {Agricultural Transition and Technical Efficiency: An Empirical Analysis
   of Wheat-Cultivating Farms in Samarkand Region, Uzbekistan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wheat and wheat products are an important part of the daily diet of
   Uzbek people, and thus, are under strategic consideration in terms of
   food security in Uzbekistan since the beginning of independence. In this
   study, wheat production during agricultural transition is reviewed and
   determinants of technical efficiency of wheat-cultivating farms in the
   Samarkand region are analyzed. Analyses are accomplished in two steps.
   In the initial step, technical efficiency of wheat farms is estimated
   using data envelopment analyses (DEA) and determenants of inefficiencies
   are analyzed by the Tobit model in the second step. Data for this study
   were collected from 124 randomly sampled private farms engaged in wheat
   production in the Samarkand region. The mean value of technical
   efficiency scores of wheat-growing farmers were found to be 0.79 and
   0.82 under constant return to scale (CRS) and variable return to scale
   (VRS) assumptions. Empirical results suggest that there is a
   considerable scope for increasing production through reallocation of
   existing resources or that private farmers can reduce their input costs
   by 21 and 18 percent while holding the same production levels. The age
   of farmers, farmers' education on agriculture, soil fertility, and the
   quality of seeds were found as the main determinants of technical
   efficiency in the study area.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {480-503},

Abstract = {The paper explores the cases of denuclearized countries, namely Belarus,
   Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine and primarily intends to answer
   the questions of how (process), why (reasons for denuclearization), and
   for what (benefits and gains) did these four countries abandon their
   strategically advantageous nuclear arsenals. For conceptual analysis, `a
   trading state' is employed, for they commonly faced the imminent need of
   guaranteeing state sovereignty and the influence of changing security
   dynamics. The four cases exhibit both generalizable commonality and
   distinctive experience in the process of denuclearization. They
   demonstrate that two mutually-reinforcing forces, `global-scale
   structural change in world politics' and `pressure for regime creation
   or change', interactively led to the final decision to enact complete
   denuclearization, albeit not effortlessly. Furthermore, unveiling the
   differences in the process of denuclearization - in terms of resistance,
   negotiation tools and leverage, stage of nuclear development,
   domestic-grown technology, internal justification for legitimacy - helps
   to clarify the gains and benefits received in return for
   denuclearization. Shedding light on these four countries, under pressure
   from nuclear weapons states, complements conventional realism-leaning
   interpretations of nuclear politics and offers policy insights to
   understand countries with nuclear ambition in contemporary world
   politics.},

Title = {Are stock market and exchange rate affected by oil price in Kazakhstan?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {This study explores the connection between oil price, stock prices, and
   exchange rate in Kazakhstan employing a monthly data from October 2007
   to December 2017. Time series data were collected from National Bank of
   Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, and Energy Information
   Administration. Both bivariate and multivariate cases were employed. At
   the same time, the Johansen and Juselius cointegration procedures were
   employed in the study. The analysis was conducted for bivariate as well
   as multivariate cases. Empirical tests demonstrate that all the series
   are nonstationary in levels but stationary in differences. Results of
   this analysis do not find long-run correlation between the variables in
   a bivariate model, however, detect one in a multivariable model. Results
   demonstrate that stock prices and exchange rate are affected by oil
   price in Kazakhstan based on Granger causality test. Our findings imply
   that policy wise, monetary authorities in Kazakhstan in attaining their
   exchange rate policy objective should be considering the implications
   for financial market. These results are important to regulatory exchange
   authorities when deciding on policy to improve the market conditions.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {In the years following independence, Kazakhstan witnessed a re-emergence
   of religious phenomenon, particularly in the form of `Islamic revival,'
   generating a kind of post-Soviet `Islamic extremism' narrative. The
   discussions, describing Islamic revival as a `security concern' and
   `potential threat' to Kazakhstan's secular objectives have deluged the
   academic, political, and policy discourse. Nevertheless, the question
   essential to contextualise the whole debate is whether the nature of
   `Islamic revival' does follow the prescriptive conditions as anticipated
   by the privatisation of religion theory, reducing the stimulus of
   religion to an individual's `private matter' or whether it has become a
   social function, affecting people's inspirations and aspirations both at
   the individual and collective level. To analyse this question
   methodologically, the study discusses theoretical formulations that are
   relevant to understanding the nature and scope of Islamic revival in the
   post-Soviet Kazakh context. Then, the study examines the practical
   impact of Islamic revival and makes reference to an institutionalization
   of Islam through religious, economic and political institutions. The
   study argues, after independence, despite the secular and authoritarian
   nature of the government, `Islamic revival' has become an
   institutionalised phenomenon and its appearance and social function in
   the public space has increased rather than decreased.},

   business cycle's impact. The gender gap in returns has additionally been
   revealed: while females tend to earn less, the returns are higher for
   them, which can likely be explained by gender differences in labor
   allocation across sectors and industries and, in turn, explains the
   higher levels of education amongst women.},

   three messages for policy purposes. First, strengthening financial
   sector is necessary to close the gap between `haves and have-nots'.
   Second, attracting FDI beyond the hydrocarbon sector is necessary to
   alleviate inequality. Finally, adaptation of education system to the new
   social and economic environment would help in improving income

Abstract = {Policy relevance
   This article analyses Kazakhstan's climate change and energy efficiency
   policies by making use of a modelling platform that provides a
   consistent framework for testing dynamic hypotheses. The effects of
   different P\&M have been evaluated as the differences between two
   scenarios according to the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines. It concludes that domestic
   climate mitigation objectives are synergistic with energy efficiency
   goals, and the set of policies adopted to achieve both objectives should
   be planned, implemented, and enforced jointly. It also quantifies the
   GHG emissions reduction if the transition to a market economy proceeds
   quickly and successfully (similar to -100 MtCO(2)e in 2030), and if a
   mitigation-specific policy is implemented (similar to -200 MtCO(2)e in
   2030) compared to a baseline projection, and it highlights the need to
   prepare more robust and detailed energy balances and inventory of
   emissions in order to develop and monitor the progress of the policies.
   This article illustrates the main difficulties encountered in the
   preparation of GHG emission projections and climate change mitigation
   policies and measures (P\&M) for Kazakhstan. Difficulties in
   representing the system with an economic model have been overcome by
   representing the energy system with a technical-economic growth model
   (MARKAL-TIMES) based on the stock of existing plants, transformation
   processes, and end-use devices. GHG emission scenarios depend mainly on
   the pace of transition in Kazakhstan from a planned economy to a market
   economy. Three scenarios are portrayed: an incomplete transition, a fast
   and successful one, and even more advanced participation in global
   climate change mitigation, including participation in some emission
   trading schemes. If the transition to a market economy is completed by
   2020, P\&M already adopted may reduce emissions of CO2 from combustion
   by about 85 MtCO(2) by 2030 - 17\% of the emissions in the baseline
   (WOM) scenario. One-third of these reductions are likely to be obtained
   from the demand sectors, and two-thirds from the supply sectors. If
   every tonne of CO2 not emitted is valued up to US\$10 in 2020 and \$20
   in 2030, additional P\&M may further reduce emissions by 110 MtCO(2) by
   2030.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to contribute to the current literature
   concerning the social acceptance of illegal practices. Using legal
   pluralism as a general framework of analysis, this study discusses the
   relationship between state law and alternative perspectives concerning
   its legitimacy. It presents the experience of people involved in hashish
   harvesting in one of the regions of Kyrgyzstan, how the state defines it
   as an `illegal practice' and how the local population subsequently
   invokes normative systems based on local spiritual knowledge and the
   local moral economy of hashish production. It argues that acceptance of
   hashish harvesting as a legitimate means of support is not a
   straightforward process. Despite the predominant legitimating narrative
   of hashish harvesting, it enters into a conversation with state defined
   notions of `illegality' and is also shaped by the customary
   understanding of the spiritual power of cannabis plants that requires
   caution when making hashish.},

   and Comparing Dimensions of Irrigation Water Security in Tajikistan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper we consider both hydrology and governance as critical
   dimensions for irrigation water security. We scale down the overall
   water security concept to the agricultural sector, suggest an index of
   irrigation water security faced by farmers, and provide an empirical
   illustration in the case of Tajikistan. Irrigation water security is
   investigated by three different dimensions: (a) a hydrology dimension,
   expressing a lack of water availability; (b) a governance dimension, the
   perceived difficulty in accessing water; and (c) a hybrid dimension of
   governance and hydrology. We developed an irrigation water security
   index, which we empirically tested using farm household survey data (N =
   399). This index provides evidence that different farm types, e.g.,
   small versus large, perceive different water security threats. Further,
   we found that if one dimension is less distinctive, the complementary
   dimension occurs as a coping mechanism. Thus, we conclude that
   diversified support mechanisms for infrastructure and management are
   needed to reach a higher level of water security.},

   have the highest mean scores compared to other countries. Independence
   dimension is found to be the first driver for all the three countries.
   However, the least important drivers of entrepreneurship are different
   for the three countries. Drivers of entrepreneurship that has the least
   effect are government support for Kyrgyzstan, family and relatives for

Abstract = {Most communist economies were dominated by large collective farms.
   Today, smaller family farms often coexist with larger corporate and
   collective farms in these countries. The roles of other-regarding
   preferences and social norms have been largely neglected in the debate
   on farmers' organizational choices. We conducted lab-in-the-field
   ultimatum game experiments with 397 cotton farmers from collective and
   family farms. Large and statistically significant differences existed in
   the rejection behavior among the two farm types. Punishment of unfair
   behavior explained organizational choice, both with and without
   controlling for other factors. We conclude that the continuation of dual
   farm structures requires tailored policy support.},

Abstract = {Research on informal financial institutions in transition economies is
   scant. This study investigates behaviour of urban money lenders in
   Uzbekistan. Money lending in Uzbekistan is a relatively new business
   which emerged mostly in response to targeted demand from fellow
   entrepreneurs during transition. We find that their lending behaviour is
   more stringent than suggested by previous studies of rural money
   lenders. They always require collateral, do not engage with the poor and
   avoid lending for consumption purposes. Their lending is short-term and
   targeted on specific business opportunities which enjoy healthy cash
   flows and offer quick returns. They have limited outreach from serving
   networks of connections within small geographical localities. Since they
   rely exclusively on their own resources for loanable funds, they often
   have to ration their loans. They actively use all available information
   and instruments to reduce default risks. Although borrowers live in
   closer geographical proximity to lenders in urban areas, they are also
   engaged in various heterogeneous activities and are more self-reliant
   with respect to the local community, which reduces the accuracy of money
   lenders' assessment of the character of borrowers as well as of their
   ability to repay.},

Abstract = {The increasingly complex and differentiated field of security sector and
   police reform has given rise to extensive research into such processes,
   but also the stalemate and contradictions they are facing. Recent
   analyses have shown how civil society actors can successfully influence
   reform and hold authorities accountable, but are also facing limits in
   terms of their own expertise, capacity and representativeness. This
   article presents new evidence of interactions between civil society,
   state authorities and international organizations on the basis of
   participatory fieldwork and public discourse analysis in the Kyrgyz
   Republic in Central Asia. Taking particular interest in practices,
   expertise and knowledge production, I show how the organization in
   focus, an NGO network promoting alternative approaches to police reform,
   had to live up to different roles in trying to effect change: that of
   activists who mobilize popular support; of experts who apply novel,
   participatory community security approaches in piloting communities; and
   lastly, that of knowledge producers providing evidence of the need for
   reform. These roles and practices, and their implications for the
   network's reform impact are critically assessed and, in conclusion,
   developed into the need for future research.},

Abstract = {The democratization of higher education (HE) has been interpreted from
   various perspectives in many country-specific case studies. Yet, it has
   been overlooked that in authoritarian regimes the democratization of HE
   may involve the development of freedom of expression, an element taken
   for granted in democratic societies. Growing research on the
   implications of COVID-19 on HE fails to cover the emergence of
   democratization of HE in the form of freedom of expression practiced by
   university students. This research examines post-Soviet Uzbekistan to
   analyse how the practising of freedom of expression emerged among the
   student body during the pandemic era in the country and how the Uzbek
   government responded to and resolved the matter. Based on this case, it
   is argued that in authoritarian states the HE democratization framework
   can include the development of freedom of expression in the form of
   student protests that, in this article's case, emerge as concomitant to
   the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Uzbekistan, being historically one of the most populated and
   agriculture-based republics in the former Soviet Union, still features
   quite high annual population growth rates and great dependence on
   agriculture as a backbone for the rest of the economic reforms. With
   water playing an extremely important role in producing a sufficient food
   base for the country's growing population and earning much needed
   foreign exchange for the government to ensure overall econornic
   development, the pressures on this scarce resource will obviously and
   inevitably grow, putting it much at risk over a long-term perspective.
   So would available water be enough to meet ever-increasing demands from
   major economic uses in the foreseeable future, and what can be the
   options for meeting such demands - these are the key questions raised
   and researched in this article. As such the research concentrates on the
   two major country-specific scenarios with water and its multiple uses
   for Uzbekistan - the business as usual and the best case. Both scenarios
   discuss possible future implications for the next quarter-century given
   certain assumptions. Finally when Summarizing the findings, the paper
   provides conclusions and recommendations as to how the model and further
   scenarios can be better optimized given the trans-boundary nature of
   most water resources in Central Asia where Uzbekistan geographically
   belongs. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Spirituality and anti-Western rhetoric in Uzbekistan in the early 2000s:
   the consequences of international misrecognition},
Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {228-245},
Abstract = {References to the spirituality-morality (ma'naviyat) of the Uzbek people
   increased substantially throughout the course of Islam Karimov's years
   in office as the President of Uzbekistan. Uzbek values were presented as
   qualities springing from the country's supposedly unique civilizational
   heritage, cast as something distinct from Western civilizational norms
   and practice. This source of distinctiveness, however, soon gave way to
   a type of exclusionary discourse in the early 2000s, centered on clearly
   differentiating Uzbekistan from the West. This essay provides a lens
   through which to understand the phenomenon, arguing that international
   recognition of status partly accounts for the rise in the particularly
   anti-Western variant of Karimov's rhetoric. Authorities in Uzbekistan,
   not unlike in Russia, built their foreign policy on the need to secure
   the country's (allegedly) important status in the international arena;
   anti-Western rhetoric arose as a response to misrecognition, as it
   evaded appeals to equality of status and legitimized growing
   isolationism. The essay reviews the origins of that rhetoric, the
   meaning of recognition, and the backdrop against which anti-Western
   moralizing rhetoric arose in Uzbekistan's international engagement. It
   also concludes with a brief assessment of how that rhetoric might affect
   (or not) the foreign policy of Uzbekistan's new president, Shavkat
   Mirziyoyev.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on the organisational problems of the state Department
   of Water Resources at the district level in the Khorezm Province,
   Uzbekistan. The study opens the organisational `black box' and looks
   inside the organisational structure of the Department of Water
   Resources. The analysis goes beyond the current studies and reports
   focusing on the duties of the organisation, by analysing the logistical
   capabilities and the constraining factors due to the organisational
   structure after the merger in 1997 between the Ministry of Agriculture
   and the Ministry of Melioration and Water Management. The paper utilises
   organisational theory approaches to power for analysing the state
   Department of Water Resources.
   Even though the merger between the two Ministries was supposed to create
   two equally important departments within one Ministry, the analysis
   shows that the Department of Water Resources got submerged into the
   organisation. The water department lost its old organisational objective
   of distributing water `equitably' to agricultural water users. The
   dominant objective of the whole organisation became the old objective of
   the agricultural department, namely fulfilling the target of the state
   order. In addition, the ability of the water resource department to
   manage and to control water resources was reduced during the merger. The
   merger reduced not only the resource power of the water department, but
   also its process power. The collected data shows that the decisions on
   water distribution were strongly influenced by the agricultural
   department and the governors of the districts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the internationalization of higher education (IoHE)
   in Kazakhstan and it being among the top 15 countries sending students
   abroad, the level of student mobility between Kazakhstan and Japan and
   factors influencing it have not been well analyzed. Aim: The purpose of
   this study was to explore outgoing student mobility from Kazakhstan to
   Japan and the reasons underlining this situation. Methods: A descriptive
   study, involving a literature review and an analysis of data from the
   two largest universities in Kazakhstan together with those from the
   Bolashak international scholarship scheme, was performed. Results: The
   analysis suggested that outgoing student mobility from Kazakhstan to
   Japan remains at a stable but low level. The mobility of students is
   mainly a matter of the initiative of universities or the students
   themselves. The main reasons are the dependence of the policy of the
   IoHE on the foreign policy of Kazakhstan; the low level of pull factors
   for students such as affordability, recommendations from acquaintances,
   or lack of awareness about the country; and absence of a supportive
   legislative basis for the development of cooperation on higher education
   between the two countries. Conclusion: Given the areas of common
   interest economically and politically between Kazakhstan and Japan,
   there is potential for significantly more student mobility than there is
   at present.},

Abstract = {The demise of the USSR led to the collapse of its centrally organised
   retail system. With this collapse the supply of consumer goods dried up,
   especially in the remote parts of the former USSR. At the same time the
   advent of capitalism offered a new institutional framework for
   independent retail activities. In the Kyrgyz Republic, where the
   economic liberalisation followed strictly the Washington Consensus, a
   large number of small shops emerged in both urban and rural areas. This
   study analyses the reasons for this boom in retail start-ups as well as
   the constraints the mainly inexperienced merchants encounter. As will be
   shown, any success in retail activities depends greatly on the
   performance of other economic sectors. The main goal of starting a
   retail business is to minimize risks within the overall livelihood
   strategies of households in rural Kyrgyzstan. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {This article investigates the micro-level considerations leading to the
   decision to migrate within the former Soviet Union. By conducting a
   survey and focus group of minorities in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, it
   specifies hypotheses from the theoretical literature on migration
   centred on political/national and economic factors and their
   interaction, and then tests them in the field. The results indicate that
   economic factors were of primary importance in explaining people's
   decisions and political factors were rarely sufficient to produce
   migration. Nation-building and everyday nationalism influenced migration
   decisions only insofar as they affected people's material well being, by
   creating language barriers and facilitating the preferential treatment
   of locals over minorities in receiving employment. The most decisive
   factor was the perception of overall economic decline that decreased
   people's standards of living and diminished their prospects for
   employment and opportunities for their children. Researchers must
   therefore pay more attention to the effects of structural decline on
   individual households and the interaction of political and economic
   factors in the decision to migrate.},

Journal = {FUEL},

Abstract = {Environmentalists and scientists are agreed that the rapid growth of the
   global economy and human activities has become the reason for the
   environmental deterioration. The typical energy resources like fossil
   fuels are considered ecological devastation factors. This research
   investigates the relationship between a sustainable environment and
   economic growth in the European and Central Asian Countries by using
   yearly data series from 1971 to 2016. The ARDL approach is used to
   determine the short and long-run relationship among the selected set of
   variables. The CO2 emission represents environmental sustainability
   while energy consumption, personal remittances, GDP, and FDI are
   independent variables and archetypal of economic growth. The CO2
   emission is the Granger cause of GDP while energy consumption and FDI
   Granger cause CO2 emission. The results confirm long and short-run
   relationships among variables. Conclusively, a significant negative
   relationship for the long run and a positive relationship for the
   short-run between CO2 emission and GDP authorizes the worsening of
   environmental sustainability is because of economic growth for a longer
   term. By analyzing data series and determining their impact on the
   environment, this research suggested that the adaptation of the green
   resource is necessary for the individual sector of the economy sooner
   rather than later to maintain the environment for the living being. This
   research will be a healthy contribution to the discussion of green
   growth and help policymakers establish the normative ground for economic
   sectors to contribute to environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Background: The rapidly growing rates of HIV infection in Kazakhstan are
   largely driven by injection drug use. The study adapts a family-focused
   evidence-based HIV and substance use prevention intervention for at-risk
   adolescents from communities in Almaty that have been greatly affected
   by heroin trade and use.
   Methods: This NIDA-funded pilot feasibility trial included 181 at-risk
   adolescents (ages 14-17) recruited through local schools and 181 of
   their parents or other adult family members. To be eligible, youth had
   to reside in city areas with high drug exposure and have at least one
   personal or family risk factor (e.g., substance-using family members or
   friends, parental criminal history). In addition to the standard
   school-based health education program on drug use and HIV, intervention
   arm adolescent-caregiver dyads received three pilot computerized
   sessions focused on caregiver-adolescent communication, support and
   monitoring. Adolescents and caregivers completed ACASI surveys in
   Russian at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-ups and a subsample from the
   treatment group (n = 24 dyads) also participated in post-intervention
   focus group interviews.
   Results: At 6-month follow-up, small effect sizes were detected for
   parenting practices as the key theoretical mediating variable.
   Intervention arm participants reported a reduction in harsh discipline
   practices (Cohen's d = - .35, p = .026), an increase in positive and
   supportive parenting (d = 0.26, p = .042), and a decline in poor
   monitoring (according to caregivers d = -0.23, p = .137 and adolescents
   d = -0.25, p = .113). Post-intervention focus groups provided examples
   of how the intervention content allowed caregivers to reconnect with
   their children and get more involved in each other's lives.
   Conclusion: In middle-income countries like Kazakhstan, interventions
   that integrate family involvement approaches and utilize interactive
   technologies may represent an engaging and potentially effective tool
   with high fidelity and easy scalability to reduce substance use and
   other risk-taking behaviors among at-risk youth.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the relationship between Temporal
   Collective Relative Deprivation and collective well-being in the context
   of dramatic social change in Kyrgyzstan. Traditional research has
   evaluated Temporal Collective Relative Deprivation by comparing a
   group's present situation to a point it? the recent past or future. We
   argue that a reconceptualization of Temporal Collective Relative
   Deprivation is needed. We hypothesized, first, that examining several,
   as opposed to a single, points of comparison will better predict
   collective well-being. Secondly, we hypothesized that the points of
   comparison that will best predict collective well-being will not
   necessarily correspond to the most recent past or future. Third, we
   hypothesized that the overall trajectoty of Temporal Collective Relative
   Deprivation perceived across time will influence the level of collective
   well-being. A sample of 565 Kyrgyz participants completed a
   questionnaire. Hierarchical regressions and group-based trajectory
   modeling confirmed our three hypotheses. Theoretical and methodological
   implications of the findings arc, discussed. Copyright (C) 2008 John

Abstract = {The article examines the set of tools that China is using to expand its
   influence in Kyrgyzstan's security sphere and the relationship of these
   actions to Russia's traditional role in the region. Through in-depth
   interviews with experts in the military field, the authors conclude that
   Beijing is gradually `maximising power' in relation to Russia, which
   still occupies a leading position in Central Asia (including education
   and the supply of weapons), in a manner that is non-aggressive and
   covert. These actions are reflected in the non-institutionalised nature
   of China's interactions with countries in the region, which are more
   beneficial, in contrast, to institutionalised mechanisms. Beijing is
   betting on its `safe city' system in Central Asia, which will allow the
   country to solve its own internal problems (Uyghur separatism,
   terrorism) while also strengthening Chinese influence in the security
   sphere by permitting it access to the data of Kyrgyz citizens and by
   making Kyrgyzstan more financially dependent on China; its educational
   programs for security service employees in Central Asia, which will, in
   turn, prepare the ground for the legalisation of the activities of
   Chinese PMCs (military contractors or `private military companies').},

Abstract = {Immigration is a sensitive topic on the American political, social, and
   economic agenda. Globalization as well as the end of the Cold War have
   meant that people are on the move worldwide as never before. Millions of
   people from poor countries migrate to richer ones to provide better
   lives for themselves and their families through legal and illegal
   channels. Heated debates surround this subject. A dramatic divide
   persists between proponents, who equate immigration policy with civil
   rights, and opponents, who cite the burden of illegal immigration on
   public education and public welfare systems. The author argues that
   informal institutions involved in migration processes, such as migrant
   smuggling networks, explain why the current crisis persists. The role of
   informal institutions is examined by focusing on those who migrate from
   Kyrgyzstan to the United States seeking low-wage labor. The author
   generalizes how formal and informal institutions interact in the
   processes of migration and how informal institutions decisively
   influence immigration-related policies in the United States.},

Abstract = {In many parts of the world, especially Central Asia, pigeon towers have
   been constructed as traditional buildings with different forms and types
   to keep pigeons. These buildings are cylindrical, cubic, dome-like and
   multi-cylinder in shape. This study was conducted to identify the
   effects of sunlight and shadow on the surfaces of pigeon towers in Iran,
   Qatar, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia with hot and dry or humid climates.
   Several pigeon towers with different types and structures in these
   countries were selected and modeled in detail in Rhino 5. Radiance and
   Ecotect were then employed to measure solar radiation and shadow on the
   surfaces of the pigeon towers on the hottest day of the year. According
   to the graphical and numerical results obtained, sunlight and shadow
   differently affected the surfaces of the different pigeon towers. The
   effect level of sunlight and shadow on the single-form pigeon towers was
   higher than on the vaults. In fact, solar radiation was lower and shadow
   was higher per square meter of the surfaces of the vaults constructed as
   pigeon towers in close proximity. These houses were therefore found to
   be the optimal type for the hot and dry or humid climate in Central
   Asia.},

   of the Soviet-era bureaucracy and emergence of a marketising yet
   rent-seeking state bureaucracy has facilitated the emergence of `active
   citizens' in self-built shanty towns in two locations in Kyrgyzstan -
   the capital, Bishkek, and the Issyk Kul resort region in the east. Based
   on participant observation and research interviews with members of
   so-called `self-help groups' in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan, in which
   residents co-organise to lobby local government for basic amenities and
   pool funds to raise money for community infrastructure and services in
   the absence of a functioning state, the paper makes two contributions to
   understanding the nature of citizenship in the context of weak,
   post-Soviet states. First, it suggests that, rather than seeing
   self-organised citizens as a threat to stability - a perspective common
   to non-liberal governments - these initiatives are supported and
   encouraged by the Kyrgyz authorities, since they perform tasks and
   provide services in lieu of the weak state. Autonomous citizens who can
   take responsibility for their own welfare are useful when the state
   cannot provide adequate services. Hence, leaders of weak states are able
   to recontextualise global neoliberal discourses of active citizenship,
   which emphasise autonomous, rational citizens, in order to legitimise
   their functional inabilities. Second, it seeks to problematise the
   binary distinction between the `passive Soviet citizen' and the modern,
   post-Soviet active citizen, evident in government and international NGO
   discourses, and suggests that the idea of the `passive Soviet citizen'
   is a discursive trope utilised to distinguish desirable from undesirable
   subjectivity in the post-Soviet market state.},

Title = {Quantifying water volumes of small lakes in the inner Aral Sea Basin,
   Central Asia, and their potential for reaching water and food security},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the inner Aral Sea Basin of Central Asia, numerous small lakes
   scattered over the irrigated landscape supply diverse ecosystem services
   for humans and nature. This study aimed to estimate the water volumes
   and assess the potentials of these small lakes for instance as
   irrigation reserve during the ever-recurring periods of water scarcity
   in the ecologically endangered Amudarya Delta. Bathymetric measurements
   gathered in the Khorezm region, Northwest Uzbekistan, permitted
   developing a statistical relationship between the surface and volume of
   the lakes. Landsat satellite data enabled for classifying the water
   bodies and hence deriving lake volumes over the study area. In 2002, the
   lakes stored similar to 0.032 km(3) water during the winter season, but
   similar to 0.057 km(3) during the main, 5-6 months spanning irrigation
   period. The area-wide increase in lake volumes during the irrigation
   period underlined the magnitude to which the currently practiced,
   inefficient use of irrigation water, produces excess water that in turn
   contributes to the existence of the small, mesotrophic lakes. Based on
   crop water requirements, calculations showed that the reuse of lake
   water may compensate for water-scarce situations, albeit to a certain
   extend only. An increased share (13 \% above average) of water-intensive
   rice fields in the vicinity of the lakes substantiated that some lakes
   are already used in this way. It is argued that, in case of sufficient
   water quality, as indicated by other studies, more targeted exploration
   of such lake water can help simultaneously both, increasing food and
   water security of the households surrounding the lakes and safeguarding
   a supply to maintain different ecosystem functions. Integrated
   management of all water resources may reduce excess irrigation water
   supply to the region, which in turn may lessen the dependency of Central
   Asian downstream countries on transboundary water and supply water
   resources for the ecosystems in the river deltas.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The Kyrgyz energy sector is characterised by a dramatic energy crisis
   that has deprived a substantial part of the population from access to
   energy. Non-traditional renewable energy sources have emerged as a
   promising alternative in providing basic energy services to the rural
   poor. Based on qualitative interview data from local households and
   project planners, this study sets out to assess impacts, limitations and
   barriers of non-traditional renewable energy projects in rural areas in
   Kyrgyzstan. This study argues that recent renewable energy efforts from
   multilateral international agencies, the private sector, and
   nongovernmental organisations exhibit great potential in creating
   tangible benefits and improving basic energy services, but have so far
   been inefficient in establishing and replicating sustainable and
   long-term energy solutions. Existing practices need to be improved by
   attaching greater importance to the capacities and real needs of the
   rural poor. The guidance of integrated programmes and policies along
   with alternative financing schemes and awareness-raising are urgently
   needed to leverage local success stories and to facilitate a sustainable
   energy development in rural Kyrgyzstan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Comparative Perspective},
Journal = {ASIAN PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {To secure an oil and gas supply, China has built several types of energy
   infrastructure near its borders and developed energy cooperation with
   regional partners based on this infrastructure. However, not all energy
   cooperation projects develop at an equal pace or are equally successful.
   This study employs the neofunctionalist spillover hypothesis-one of
   several key discourses applied to explaining European integration-to
   account for the difference in regional cooperation between two
   China-driven energy megaprojects in Asia: the China-Central Asia
   Pipelines and the China-Southeast Asia Pipelines. After investigation
   into the so-called spillover hypothesis, including ``functional
   spillover,{''} ``political spillover,{''} and ``cultivated
   spillover,{''} the more successful of the two projects was also found to
   be more significant in terms of its spillover effect. Thus, this article
   finds that regional cooperation in the Chinese context also supports the
   spillover hypothesis, which has conventionally been regarded as a
   Europe-based discourse.},

Abstract = {This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between
   COVID-19 pandemic and work outcomes of men and women in the case of
   Central Asia, region with under-established formal institutions,
   relatively poor social infrastructure, and mostly patriarchal society.
   These features of Central Asian countries make them different from other
   developed countries that vast majority of existing literature on
   COVID-19 pandemic and work outcomes nexus focus on. Findings suggest
   that medium-term employment level is strongly dependent upon short-term
   work productivity, with the latter being highly dependent on several
   explanatory variables, including gender. Further analysis reveal that
   women-mothers and women working from home-office tend to have lower work
   productivity as short-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in
   turn negatively influences women's medium-term employment level. The
   paper sheds light on gender-disaggregated situation in the labor market
   of the country and provides empirical recommendations for decision
   makers at both government and business levels.},

Abstract = {Research into the development of community-based tourism (CBT) within
   Central Asian economies that were part of the former USSR is

   rural mountain communities; a gap addressed by this research focusing on
   the Republic of Tajikistan, specifically the Zerafshan valley and Fann
   mountains. In 2019, 20 qualitative interviews were conducted with a
   range of residents involved with three externally funded tourism
   development projects and/or with tourism. Project documents were
   analysed and the first author's extensive experience of living and
   working in Tajikistan also informed the research. The findings
   demonstrate that CBT has created jobs and generated income. However,
   benefits were not equally distributed, causing social tensions.
   Additionally, development projects did not foresee or account for
   structural limitations relating to infrastructure and accommodation. The
   article concludes with recommendations for future donor interventions.},

   particular way of generating trust and institutionalized cooperation was
   by social leverage, involving third parties as contract witnesses and/or
   guarantors. These usually had own commercial relations with the
   contractors, facilitating crediting and exchange - and credible threat
   to defectors. While Greif (1989) had been criticized for overlooking
   courts in the Maghribi case, we discuss a differentiated (latent) role
   for courts. We also discuss property rights versus possession,
   transactions costs and price implications. We analyze the mechanism in

Abstract = {A critical component of evaluations of the effectiveness of intimate
   partner violence prevention programmes involves understanding pathways
   of change among individuals who participate in such programmes, and the
   intervention or contextual elements that support or hinder these. This
   paper draws on qualitative evaluations of four intimate partner violence
   prevention programmes in Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa and Tajikistan
   conducted as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence against Women
   and Girls Programme. Using a comparative case study approach, a
   secondary analysis was applied to thematically analysed data to explore
   how and why men and women change in response to different types of
   programmes across diverse contexts. Similar pathways of change were
   identified including the value of learning and applying relationship
   skills to support equitable, non-violent relationships; the importance
   of participatory approaches to challenge harmful gender norms and allow
   for group rapport; and the integration of economic empowerment
   activities to reduce drivers of intimate partner violence and conflict,
   and promote participants' self-confidence and status. These findings
   provide insights regarding intervention design and implementation
   factors pertinent to bring about changes in intimate partner violence.},

Abstract = {This study extends the P/CVE scholarship from the ``what{''} and
   ``how{''} questions of assessment (What and how do countries do in P/CVE
   area?) to the underlying ``why{''} issues (Why do countries choose to
   define and approach P/CVE in certain ways?). Toward the goal of
   explaining states' P/CVE programs, we put forth a ``3-Is{''} framework
   emphasizing the impact interests, ideas, and institutions on their
   measures for countering violent extremism. Jointly, these concepts
   direct our attention to the pragmatic and ideational aspects of
   policymaking as well as the countries' institutional legacies. We apply
   this framework to the case of Kazakhstan to illuminate and explain
   certain highly visible aspects of its P/CVE program.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the effects of trade sanctions between Russia and
   Western countries on Kazakhstan. The nature of these sanctions is
   characterized by unilateral sanctions from Russia and multilateral
   sanctions against Russia. Although Kazakhstan refused to participate in
   these sanction wars, this might affect its economy significantly as it
   is highly integrated into the Russian economy. An empirical analysis is
   performed on the product level and time series techniques are used to
   estimate the effects of the sanctions. The paper assesses the overall
   effectiveness of trade sanctions through aggregating product level
   results into a sanction index. The derived sanction index shows that
   multilateral sanctions did not divert the trade flows from Western
   countries. On the other hand, the index indicates the existence of
   sanction busting activities against Russian unilateral
   counter-sanctions, confirming the hypothesis that unilateral sanctions
   are ineffective and allow for third-country effects.},

Abstract = {Access to financial resources is the main constraint for sustainable
   economic growth in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's financial institutions,
   being relatively small in size and unbalanced, cannot finance
   development through market mechanisms. The model that reflects the
   system's sustainable development was constructed based on the fuzzy
   cognitive map to consolidate 31 indicators of three types of the
   subsystem: economic, financial institutions, and financial markets to
   reflect the viability and balance of the system development. The
   time-series data of Kazakhstan's economic and financial development of
   Kazakhstan from 2014 to 2019 with prognosis to 2025 was used. Based on
   the results of our research, we concluded that the implementation of
   policies for sustainable development should include not only specific
   aims for the financial market but also for financial institutions and
   the economy. Moreover, sustainability is reinforced by the development
   of integration, innovativeness, and accessibility, which forms the key
   aspects of financial system state policy development.},

   effect on energy consumption in the long run for the Kazakhstani case

Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the evolving
   patterns and challenges of talent management (TM) in the emerging
   markets of Russia and Kazakhstan from the employer perspective.
   Increasing the understanding of how TM is recognized from the employer
   perspective may better equip us to address how to effectively manage and
   lead the available talents in these and other emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative study
   comprising 50 semi-structured interviews, with 37 business leaders from
   Russian subsidiaries, and 13 from Kazakh subsidiaries, in all cases of
   Nordic Multinational enterprises (MNEs). Findings The study supports the
   object approach to TM in the emerging markets of Russia and Kazakhstan.
   The authors reveal that the exclusive and developable talent philosophy
   is predominant in these emerging markets, where TM faces the challenges
   of fierce competition for talents and an insufficient supply, so
   business leaders tend to be reluctant to inform employees of their
   talent pool membership. The results demonstrate that MNEs do not act
   independently of context, thus supporting calls for consideration of the
   local institutional context. Originality/value TM is still a somewhat
   novel idea in many emerging economies, and challenges related to
   managing talents are believed to be far more complex in such settings.
   Furthermore, to the best of authors' knowledge, no studies have
   investigated the notion of talent and TM conceptualization in the
   emerging markets from an employer perspective.},

Title = {Cooperative agricultural production to exploit individual heterogeneity
   under a delivery target: The case of cotton in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study argues that heterogeneous farms operating under a delivery
   target may yield significant economic benefits if they coordinate their
   production portfolio. To analyze the gains from cooperation, we simulate
   various cooperative game solutions over seven cotton producing farms in
   a bio-economic model of a water users association. The study results
   show that cooperation can fulfill multiple objectives: ensure the cotton
   production targets, increase farm profits and grain production, and
   reduce the pressure on water resources. We investigate a situation where
   farms differ in soil quality and distance to irrigation canals. The
   proposed modification in the national cotton procurement policy that
   utilizes the comparative advantages of cooperating cotton-producing
   farms can make the cooperative agreements economically attractive even
   among heterogeneous farms. It should be noted that the benefits offered
   from farm cooperation may be smaller or even vanish if transaction costs
   grow excessively in response to the heterogeneity of participating farms
   and the size of the cooperative. In addition, the economic benefits will
   not necessarily be distributed equally among participating farms and
   thus require the development of fair division rules. In this respect,
   net gain allocation schemes based on production costs, size and cotton
   output of farm cooperation are presented and discussed against the
   distinct social features of rural Uzbekistan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Voluminous theoretical and empirical literature examines the relation
   between financial-sector development and economic growth. However,
   previous studies have largely ignored progress in former Soviet Central
   Asian republics engaged in transition from socialist command economies
   to market economies. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature
   by considering Kazakhstan's experience with financial-sector
   liberalization and the socioeconomic effects of these reforms. We
   summarize the prereform economic circumstances prevailing in Kazakhstan,
   outline the major characteristics of its postcommunist financial system,
   and provide a detailed chronicle of financial-sector reform measures
   from 1993 to 2006. The paper focuses on the evolution of Kazakhstan's
   banking structure, policies adopted by the National Bank of Kazakhstan,
   and the approach taken to the privatization of state banks, as well as
   the steps taken to improve bank accounting standards and banking
   supervision. The development path of nonbank financial institutions and
   capital markets is also examined. We consider the outcomes of
   financial-sector reforms and their effects on the economy as a whole.},

   Uzbekistan, the State Statistics Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan
   and other public funds, and the regression equation of the SEM-model of
   the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the stock market of Uzbekistan
   was formed. In particular, indicators such as the latest daily and total
   number of people infected with Covid-19 in the Republic of Uzbekistan,
   the total number of recovered people after being infected with Covid-19,
   the total number of people who died of the disease, the daily number of
   recovered people post-infection, the stock market index of Uzbekistan,
   Uzbekistan Indicators such as the number of daily securities traded on
   the Republican Stock Exchange ``Tashkent{''}, the exchange rate of the
   US dollar set by the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan were
   selected as the main factors. The constructed regression equation was
   examined using F-statistics, Student's t-test, and multicorrelation
   tests to determine the level of adequacy. The authors identify factors
   based on a systematic analysis of the scientific work of world-renowned
   scientists on major stock markets and creates a SEM-model of the factors

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to estimate the mean, prevalence, and
   severity of dental caries, and to identify the factors associated with
   these characteristics in a population of school-aged children from four
   regions in Kazakhstan. A total of 2,149 school children aged 11-15 years
   from four regions of Kazakhstan were examined; the overall response rate
   was 68\%. Results from dental examinations and standardized
   questionnaires were used to gather sociodemographic and oral health
   behavior information. The overall prevalence of dental caries was 74\%,
   and obviously decayed teeth were found in 44\% of the participants; only
   6\% had missing teeth and 24\% had their teeth treated. Age, region,
   ethnicity, dietary habits, and dental attendance pattern were found to
   be significantly associated with the predicted degree of caries
   experience among those with caries experience. The high prevalence of
   dental caries might be related to rapid westernization in Kazakhstan and
   associated nutritional transition. Moreover, an increased burden of
   untreated caries in less advantaged populations was observed. Parental
   education and material deprivation may be very important determinants of
   oral health among adolescents in Kazakhstan.},

   nationalized moral paradigm of respect for ancestral lands, cultural

Abstract = {Globally, universities have an interest in recruiting the most talented
   students; however, limited attention has been given to how these
   students experience their transition and adjustment to university life.
   This mixed-methods study analyzes the academic, social, emotional, and
   institutional dimensions of gifted students' adjustment to university in
   the context of post-Soviet Kazakhstan, a country characterized by a
   strong emphasis on the education of gifted students. The findings of the
   study confirm that the process of gifted students' adjustment to
   university is a complex phenomenon, and all the aspects of students'
   first-year experiences should be carefully taken into consideration when
   studying the transition to postsecondary education. The results of the
   study are useful for understanding the issues that gifted students face
   in the transition to higher education and have important implications
   for research on gifted students' postsecondary experiences

Abstract = {The chapter focuses on cross-border relations between the Republic of

   attempts of respective states to intervene in and/or co-opt

   on opposite sides of closely guarded borders for most of the 20th
   century, the two adjoining regions managed to keep alive
   long-established traditions of cross-border interactions thanks to
   shared ethnic, cultural, and linguistic features. The frontier societies
   there today have lived through multiple challenges - the indiscriminate
   border policy of the Soviet era on Kazakhstan's side and the tumultuous
   early years of socialist China engendered exoduses of people across
   semi-controlled borders. Almost all official interactions stopped until
   the 1990s when new challenges and opportunities presented themselves
   and, with them, the revival of informal cross-border exchanges and
   states' attempts to co-opt and control them.},

   in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The imbalance in the supply and demand for resources is a thorny issue
   that many countries have to face. Food is a basic resource throughout
   the world. Understanding the exact situation of food production and
   consumption is an important foundation for sustainable development. This
   paper aims to explore the quantity and pattern changes in food
   production and consumption in Kazakhstan. This can reflect the level of
   residents' standard of living and the situation of natural resource use.
   This paper focuses on the quantitative relationship between animal-based
   food and plant-based food and the tendency towards changes in urban and
   rural residents' food production and consumption in Kazakhstan based on
   the emergy analysis method. The data of food production and consumption
   were mainly obtained from the official statistics of the Food and
   Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank, Statistical Commission
   of the Ministry of National Economy of Kazakhstan, and literature. The
   research results showed that, over time, Kazakhstan residents' food
   consumption patterns have become more varied, and the proportion of meat
   consumption to total food consumption has increased. Although the rural
   per capita food consumption is significantly different from that of
   urban residents, this gap decreased in 2019. In Kazakhstan, the
   consumption of several types of food still relies on imports. Food
   production and consumption are affected by economic, social, and
   ecological factors. The results of this research can provide scientific
   support for reasonable and sustainable production and consumption
   strategies in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {The geological industry of Kazakhstan is transiting to CRIRSCO, the
   international system of reporting standards for mineral reserves. In
   view of the set tasks, the problem of adjusting the geological and
   economic assessment of deposits is being updated in order to adapt it to
   the international requirements and to increase accessibility and
   transparency for a potential external investor. This research has been
   carried out on the basis of the Kazakhmys Corporation LLC, the largest
   international company engaged in exploring, mining and processing of
   various minerals. The authors of this paper have made an attempt to
   expand the geological and economic assessment of the enterprise by
   digitizing the key business processes. On the basis of the formed
   factual database of the geological and economic indicators and
   characteristics of the stratiform pyrite-copper-lead-zinc deposit
   Kusmuryn, which is part of the Kazakhmys Corporation LLC, the economic
   indicators of extracting associated components have been calculated.
   Digital transformation is a key area of technological development of the
   mining industry in Kazakhstan for the coming years. In this regard,
   automation of calculating the geological and economic assessment of the
   investigated field will allow the company not only to reduce investment
   and operating costs, but also to deepen the internal analytical work to
   monitor the effectiveness of the applied digital solutions.
   Transformation of the economy of Kazakhstan presupposes state support
   for promising regions. The article shows that transition of the Kusmuryn
   deposit to underground mining in the medium term will accelerate the
   solution of pressing regional problems and remove social tension in the
   monotowns adjacent to the deposit. In order to strengthen its position
   in the global economy, Kazakhstan strives to achieve socio-economic
   goals in the field of sustainable development. It has been established
   that changing the method of production and automation of business
   processes of the Kazakhmys Corporation LLC will have a positive effect
   on the energy efficiency due to more rational use of available
   technologies. The research will improve the validity of predictive
   management decisions to strengthen the financial and economic situation
   and the international positions of the mining and smelting enterprise.},

Abstract = {This article examines the benefits and drawbacks associated with

   better understand how parents perceive the educational quality of
   distance/online learning in today's circumstances. The regression
   results show that the age of the parent and the level of family income
   are positively correlated with the parents' level of satisfaction with
   the provided distance/online learning, while the number of children in a
   family is negatively related to the parents' satisfaction with the
   learning process. The study finds a statistically significant
   association between parents' satisfaction with the quality of education
   and their assessment of teachers' competencies, and the level of
   government readiness to switch to the distance/online learning format.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of processes
   in operation during the implementation of a reform programme in
   Kazakhstan culminating in the widespread adoption of Lesson Study (LS).
   Design/methodology/approach The study is positioned within a critical
   realist theoretical perspective, drawing on Archer's social theory to
   focus on the social world of the school while changes to classroom
   practice are being made. This is a case study using process tracing
   methods to analyse how school actions and interactions are used during
   the change process resulting in widespread implementation of LS.
   Findings Three key mechanisms for implementing the structural changes
   are identified; increasing teacher's pedagogical knowledge,
   collaborative working structures and active collective inquiry. The
   capacity to change practice is underpinned by reflection on classroom
   interactions and in having the necessary skills and available time to
   analyse the effect on pupils' learning. Engaging in reflexive
   deliberation is dependent on having access to new knowledge, together
   with the opportunity to collaborate in supportive groups.
   Originality/value This study provides an insight into what changes were
   made and why these support the spread of LS in Kazakhstan, drawing on
   Archer's social theory and using theory building process tracing methods
   to delve deeper into the empirical fingerprints left during the
   intervention. LS is an important structural factor which is still
   supporting change in Kazakhstani classrooms.},

   Kazakhstan, characteristics of digital technologies influence on the
   institute development in the countries of analyzed integrity.
   The research was conducted using general scientific and special methods.
   The general scientific of comparative and evolution-genetic
   investigations were used for cross-national comparison of processes on
   implanting new governmental institutes in historical retrospective. The
   specialized methods of institutional and constitutional theory allowed
   analyzing the mutual influence of legislative and economic factors at
   making the governmental decisions in the field of digitization of
   regulatory policy within the settled national systems of public
   administration.
   The digitization priorities of the public administration system in
   Russia and Kazakhstan and settled vision of the regulatory impact
   assessment institute modification under new conditions were
   characterized. The common and specific features in approaches
   implemented by these countries to assessment institute digitization were
   revealed. The functions, structure and content of the official Internet
   portals used for arrangement of rule-making process were compared as
   well as organizational ways of acquisition and collection of information
   characterizing the activity in the field of regulatory impact
   assessment.

Abstract = {This article offers one look at the current state of public relations in
   Kazakhstan. No studies have yet examined public relations practice in
   Kazakhstan or in Central Asia. The model used as the analytical
   framework for the study is borrowed from British cultural studies and
   called ``the circuit of culture.{''} This model advances our
   understanding of the relationship among culture and meaning, culture and
   communication, and of course, culture and public relations. More
   specifically, this analysis illustrates how public relations produces,
   negotiates and even manages cultural meaning, as exemplified in
   Kazakhstan. The study finds that the language of money is the primary
   symbolic representation of public relations in Kazakhstan. (C) 2004

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Purpose Academics' perceptions of the motives of the introduction of
   quality management are still rarely investigated, particularly in
   Central Asian countries. Thus, this paper aims to understand the
   internal dynamics of organisational change within higher education
   institutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents evidence
   from an online survey of academics from three Kazakh national
   universities. Their perceptions are presented with a quantitative
   descriptive approach using means and standard deviations. Findings The
   results show that academics perceive institutional (e.g. regulations,
   professional standards, existing norms, etc.) and instrumental
   explanations (e.g. institutional learning, improvement, intra- and
   inter-organisational competition, etc.) of the introduction of quality
   management as equally important. This contradicts existing evidence from
   surveys of other groups within higher education institutions.
   Originality/value In addition to evaluating the literature, the paper
   combines institutional and instrumental reasons for the introduction of
   quality management in Kazakh universities. Taking a perspective centred
   on academics, the results indicate that scholars' assessments reveal a
   comparatively low variance regarding the importance of quality
   management. Based on these results, the paper suggests that empirical
   studies need to be broadened with comparative perspectives from
   different organisational contexts, groups and administrative traditions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine the views of teachers in
   Turkey and Kazakhstan on the social status of the teaching profession.
   The universe of the study was comprised of teachers in Ankara and
   Nur-Sultan, the capital cities of Turkey and Kazakhstan, respectively.
   In order to collect qualitative data, an interview form titled
   ``Opinions on the Status of the Teaching Profession{''} was prepared in
   Turkish and those interview questions were translated into Kazakh.
   Teachers' views on the status of the teaching profession were determined
   on the basis of the phenomenology pattern. In this context, the
   interview groups consisted of 14 teachers working in Ankara and 14
   teachers working in Nur-Sultan, 28 participants in total. The findings
   of the study revealed that some of the participants in Turkey believed
   the status of the teaching profession in the present is lower than in
   the past. Among the factors affecting social status, participants noted
   excessive workloads, incompetence of teachers, low salaries, extra
   workloads, economic dissatisfaction, and difficulties with teacher
   appointments and training. Teachers working in the province of
   Nur-Sultan stated that the status of the teaching profession in the
   country has improved following the approval of the `Teacher Status Law'
   and the increasing of the base scores for applicants to teaching
   departments. A few participants, however, noted that the status is still
   low. The factors that affect teachers' social status were identified as
   excessive workload, incompetence, teacher salaries, economic
   dissatisfaction, and problems in professional development. Turkish and
   Kazakh participants' suggestions for elevating the status of their
   profession were presented at the end of the research.},

Abstract = {From March to May 2020, 1306 oilfield workers in Kazakhstan tested
   positive for SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a case-control study to assess
   factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The cases were
   PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during June-September 2020. Controls lived
   at the same camp and were randomly selected from the workers who were
   PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2. Data was collected telephonically by
   interviewing the oil workers. The study had 296 cases and 536 controls
   with 627 (75\%) men, and 527 (63\%) were below 40 years of age.
   Individual factors were the main drivers of transmission, with little
   contribution by environmental factors. Of the twenty individual factors,
   rare hand sanitizer use, travel before shift work, and social
   interactions outside of work increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Of the
   twenty-two environmental factors, only working in air-conditioned spaces
   was associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Communication messages may
   enhance workers' individual responsibility and responsibility for the
   safety of others to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.},

Abstract = {One of the notable behaviours of individuals during the teaching of
   foreign languages is the use of the first language as an integral part
   of the learning-teaching process. This situation can also negatively
   affect the learning of a foreign language. The aim of this study is to
   determine the reasons why secondary-school students in Kazakhstan feel
   the need to use their first language (Kazakh or Russian) in
   foreign-language classes where they are studying English. The research,
   based on the general screening model, was conducted in Astana, the
   capital of Kazakhstan, in three middle schools with a group of 296 11th
   grade students. The data was obtained by using an attitude scale
   consisting of four factors which was developed by Ocak, Kuru and
   Ozchalishan (2010).The scale factor-loads varied between 0.35-0.85; and
   reliability was found to be Alpha=0.71. According to the findings,
   students avoid the use of the foreign languages they study; have
   motivation problems; have a fear of being criticized by teachers; have a
   fear of being teased by classmates; tease their friends; and don't
   believe in themselves enough. It is therefore necessary to take measures
   to increase the self-confidence of students; and a more English-speaking
   environment should be established.},

Abstract = {Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there have been major changes in
   the agricultural sector in Kazakhstan. While during the Soviet Union
   agricultural production was organized in large scale state and
   collective farms, after independence Kazakhstan started to privatize the
   agricultural land and established water user associations (WUAs) on
   their territories. The paper critically evaluates the existing
   international blueprints of WUAs. The paper concludes that irrigation
   management transfer (IMT) should not imply rapid and complete withdrawal
   of the state, but that the state is, at least in the start up period,
   necessary to enforce accountability of new formed WUAs.},

Title = {Analysis of the energy intensity of Kazakhstan: from data compilation to
   decomposition analysis},

Abstract = {There are large gaps in energy consumption data and consequently in the
   estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in Kazakhstan. This
   study provides the first comprehensive review of energy consumption
   trends in Kazakhstan, discusses several important discrepancies in
   energy statistics and presents an improved versions of Energy Balances,
   developed using additional data. The results indicate that Kazakhstan's
   energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 30\% from
   1.14 to 0.8 toe/thousand 2005USD between 2000 and 2014. To understand
   factors influencing this decline, the change in energy intensity of GDP
   was decomposed using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index I method. The
   upstream sector (mainly oil and gas) played the most important role in
   the observed GDP energy intensity change. Although the share of this
   sector in total GDP increased, causing an increase in energy intensity
   due to inter-sectoral structural effects, the consequences were
   counteracted by a twofold decline in the sector's energy intensity,
   resulting in a net decrease. On the contrary, the power and heat,
   transport and household sectors saw an increase in energy intensity
   between 2000 and 2014. The results clearly demonstrate that there is an
   urgent need for policies and measures to be put in place in the power
   and heat, household and transport sectors, to support renewable energy
   development, increase buildings' energy efficiencies, replace
   inefficient stoves and improve heating systems and encourage changes in
   public transportation systems. Furthermore, improving energy statistics
   and setting appropriate sectoral energy intensity reduction targets are
   crucial for achieving real efficiency improvements in the economy.},

Abstract = {A significant aspect of China's power is its position as upstream
   riparian on many of Asia's international rivers. China participates in
   creating and building institutions with riparians of some of these
   rivers more than others. This article argues that China's relatively
   higher level of institutionalized cooperation with Kazakhstan on
   transboundary water issues is due to the interdependence between the two
   countries, which facilitates linkages between water issues and a cluster
   of political, economic, security and strategic issues. China is
   incentivized to cooperate and accommodates Kazakhstan's concerns over
   their shared waters because a reciprocal relationship exists between
   them.},

Abstract = {This study aims is to analyze of existing concepts of gender stereotypes
   and gender differences in wages, defining of gender pay gap
   determinants, and to evaluate the level of discrimination against women
   in Kazakhstan. This paper begins by reviewing trends in gender
   stereotypes and gender segregation during the past several decades. In
   this research, authors propose the methodological tools for presenting a
   standard form of evaluation of gender pay gap. The developed
   methodological tools will allow providing authentic and formal analysis
   on gender pay gap and identifying the main determinants of gender pay
   differences. Further, the obtained results showed the distribution of
   wage gap in Kazakhstan's regions and the Duncan's dissimilation index
   allows us to trace the dynamics of changes in the professional structure
   between men and women. According to the results, gender pay gap is
   narrowing with the reduction of the job level and discrimination is
   related to differences in human capital and education. Wages in the
   industrial sector are higher for men than for women, because men's
   professions are characterized by severe and unhealthy working
   conditions. In addition, employers prefer male managers, but if they
   take woman managers, they give them salary 3 times less.},

Abstract = {Some Western pundits have embraced a ``domino{''} logic to suggest that
   Kazakhstan might share the fate of Ukraine, with its Russian minority
   being used as the pretext for Russian intervention and irredentism. In
   this article I explore several reasons that invalidate this simplistic
   and mechanical parallel. Russia's policy toward Kazakhstan aims at
   remaining the main political and cultural yardstick for the whole of
   Kazakhstani society, not merely the protector of Russian minorities.
   Perceived historical and demographic similarities between Kazakhstan and
   Ukraine are narrower than it seems at first glance. Defining a potential
   ``Kazakh Novorossiya{''} is not an easy task, even for Russian
   nationalists. Moreover, current demographic and economic trends do not
   favor Kazakhstan's Russian-majority regions, and local political
   activism and grievances have remained limited since Crimea's annexation.},

Abstract = {There is ample empirical evidence that internal migration occurs in

   However, to our knowledge, there has been no analysis of how internal

   This paper provides insight into this issue using detailed regional
   economic and migration data for Kazakhstan during boom (2000-2007) and
   crisis (2008-2014) periods. While conventional forces are affirmed, we
   find that the crisis deters migration and weakens the effect of wage
   differentials - while also reducing the deterrent effect of relative

Abstract = {The article purpose is to develop the approach to determine the optimal
   interaction scenario between conditions for doing business and specifics
   of maintaining the tax audit in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The leading
   research methods have become the method of expert assessments, the
   cognitive method, and the method of impulsive modeling. With the help of
   50 experts, factors of ease of doing business and conditions in
   Kazakhstan were identified, and a cognitive model of their interaction
   with the terms of the tax audit was developed. Based on the technology
   of impulsive modeling, a useful scenario for harmonizing compliance with
   tax audit rules and business profitability is determined. It was
   concluded that the most effective scenario for ensuring a high-quality
   tax audit and ease of doing business in Kazakhstan in current conditions
   is a reduction in the tax burden (income tax rates up to 15\%) with a
   constant level of tax audits and fines for violations. The application
   of the proposed scenario will increase the ease of doing business in
   Kazakhstan, which will help reduce the number of tax offenses, as well
   as create favorable conditions for attracting FDI to the country. The
   research originality/value lies in the fact that the developed scenarios
   are based on consideration of the most significant factors that make it
   possible to objectively assess the nature of the balance between the
   conditions for doing business and specifics of maintaining the tax audit
   in the Republic of Kazakhstan, to see its new sides.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The article discusses various approaches to the concept of
   `human capital'.
   OBJECTIVE: In the modern economy, human capital is becoming the most
   important factor in economic growth and determines the future of the
   country. The purpose of the research is to analyse the index of human
   capital in Kazakhstan, what factors have an influence and find ways to
   increase it.
   METHODS: Various methods were used, including analysis and synthesis,
   measurement and comparison.
   RESULTS: Based on the analysis of qualitative and quantitative
   parameters of human capital, the trends in the human development index
   are revealed. It was shown that human capital is a necessary independent
   factor determining economic growth. An attempt has been made to solve
   the problems of valuing human capital and equitable distribution of
   income in the context of the amortization of human capital.
   CONCLUSIONS: The main areas of human capital formation need to be
   reformed, in particular education and health, by enhancing investment.
   An analysis of the values of the human development index clearly shows
   that for the economic development of states it is necessary to pay more
   attention to such indicators for the level of education as well as for a
   decent standard of living for every citizen.},

   reached the strategic partnership level. Also, the two neighboring
   countries are partners in the international large-scale projects as the
   SCO and the New Silk Road Initiative. This paper claims that these

   is aimed to solve the security issues and the New Silk Road Initiative
   embodies the economic agenda of the bilateral relations. Kazakhstan's
   role and position is significant due to different reasons, while the
   Kazakhstani public remains cautious about the Chinese activity in
   Kazakhstan. The two named mechanisms are eventually focused on
   economical and cultural leadership of China among the secured

Abstract = {The use of symbolism in contemporary architecture is increasingly
   gaining momentum, especially so in the Eastern countries currently
   undergoing rapid economic development. Sociologically, this phenomenon
   can be related to a desire to manifest a vast wealth of national art and
   respond to the globalisation and unification of world culture. Taking
   this tendency as a prompt, this study explores different ways of
   implementing symbolic ornaments in landscape architecture. Traditionally
   architecture has been defined through and judged against culturally
   acceptable criteria that set the norm for appropriate form and
   expression. Yet, technical advances have altered this process and
   contributed to a certain level of oblivion of traditional architectural
   form. Thus, the meaning of many Kazakh ornaments has been lost through
   time. On one hand, this paper collects historical information on the
   semiotics of Kazakh ornaments and on the other hand, it conducts field
   studies focusing on the cultural tradition of the native people in
   Eurasia. The study introduces the use of symbolism in landscape
   architecture as an aspiration for luck and prosperity which then
   dictates the quality of the landscape compositions. The findings show
   that the use of symbolic ornamentation in architecture is not bound to
   specific geographic areas but rather motivated by broader underlying
   principles. Through analytical exploration of different cultures and
   their use of symbols in architecture, this study identifies four main
   categories of architectural symbolism relating to floral, zoomorphic,
   geometric and cosmogonic patterns. Each nation then recognises its own
   identity in the semiotics of those patterns and incorporates them in the
   urban realm as part of its cultural legacy.},

Abstract = {The study examines the features of the distance learning system of the

   study is to analyze the Kazakhstan experience of organizing distance
   learning in higher education in the field of choreography training. As
   an example, the experience of the {[}BLINDED] in the distance learning
   process has been analyzed and practical recommendations on teaching
   professional disciplines in this field of training have been given. To
   analyze distance learning, surveys among teachers and students have been
   conducted. In addition, based on international scientific literature,
   dance lessons have been analyzed in accordance with COVID-19
   restrictions. The disadvantages and advantages of the online learning
   system for students have been identified based on a questionnaire. The
   survey involved teachers and students of ballet pedagogy, choreography
   pedagogy, choreography directing, ballroom dance pedagogy, as well as
   undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students. A total of 20 teachers
   and 75 students have been interviewed, and the effectiveness of the
   platforms used in distance learning has been determined. On the basis of
   available research, the opinion that in the field of choreography
   pedagogical skills of rising professionals and performers cannot be
   formed exclusively through distance learning has been substantiated.},

Abstract = {Using the perspective of political opportunity structure, this
   qualitative survey of primary sources attempts to determine whether
   environmental NGOs (ENGOs) in Kazakhstan are achieving
   institutionalisation from the standpoint of representative democracy, or
   are being co-opted by a corporatist national government. Are ENGOs the
   harbingers of the democratisation of the country that many observers
   hope to see? Given increases in the nation's budgets for the environment
   and easing of NGO/ENGO legislation, the institutionalising project would
   seem to have some prospects for success. Concomitantly, the
   participation of civic groups in the policy arena has contributed to
   better governance through experiments in new forms of state-society
   partnership. However, these partnerships have under-performed. Local
   governments face conflicting demands, while the insufficient
   administrative and technical capacity of state agencies highlights the
   need for capacity building. On the political level, authentic ENGOs must
   compete for policy inclusion with co-opted ``front{''} organisations
   selectively favoured by the national government, at the same time that
   the government's ambiguity towards ENGOs retards the latter's
   institutionalisation. The immediate future of environmental civic
   society is uncertain.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze whether the long-term economic growth of
   Kazakhstan is subject to macroeconomic constraints. The
   balance-of-payments-constrained growth (BPCG) models predict that a
   country's growth rate can be approximated through the ratio of growth
   rates of exports to the income elasticity of demand for imports. We
   apply the BPCG model to Kazakhstan's quarterly data-a typical emerging
   economy with a low trade to GDP ratio. To estimate the trade parameters
   we use Johansen's cointegration technique. Vector error correction model
   is employed to analyze the short-run adjustments of income elasticities.
   The results demonstrate that the average growth rate estimated by the
   BPCG hypothesis projects around 2\% long-run economic growth for

Abstract = {The global economy is on its way to digital transformation. The
   processes of the digital economy are actively continuing in all

   technologies (ICT) by enterprises and the public. International
   organizations are involved in research on maximizing benefits for the
   growth of the value added of business and society and the potential to
   minimize losses from digitalization. The analysis of state and
   interstate program documents, the scientific literature and the most
   important indices of the development of information and communication
   technologies and digitalization allows generalizing the main factors of
   the development of the digital economy:
   high innovation activity in the economy as a fundamental factor
   determining the potential for generating new ICT solutions;

Abstract = {The aim of the present research is to identify whether teachers'
   attitudes towards the use of Content and Language Integrated Learning
   (CLIL) in the Republic of Kazakhstan can undergo significant changes if
   they study a course introducing them to the fundamentals of CLIL.
   Despite the country's plans to adopt English as one of the languages of
   education, stakeholders' attitudes towards teaching through the medium
   of this language remain rather skeptical. A survey was held among
   Master's degree students majoring in Education (n = 59) at Pavlodar
   State University before the course and after its completion. Since it is
   the affective component that largely determines the quality of
   attitudes, the levels of participants' anxiety, self-esteem and
   motivation were used as the indicators. The tools for measuring these
   variables were the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Dembo-Rubinstein's
   Method of Self-esteem Measurement and Dubovitskaya's Diagnostics of
   Learning Motivation Orientation. The end-of-course results show a marked
   reduction in the level of participants' state anxiety, a growth in
   self-esteem in terms of the readiness to use CLIL, and a shift towards
   intrinsic motivation. It is argued that for attitudes shift to take
   place, it is necessary to adopt a constructivist approach to teaching
   and learning.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {This article investigates internationally funded women's empowerment
   initiatives in Tajikistan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in
   1991 and the subsequent Tajik civil war (1992-1997), this newly
   independent, Muslim-majority country has experienced an influx of
   foreign aid, including in the field of women's rights. Drawing on
   extensive fieldwork, the article analyzes the growth and diversification
   of local, Western-funded women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   between 1991 and 2020, paying attention to their leadership and aims, as
   well as changing perceptions of donors' interventions. It is argued
   that, initially, local activists were supportive of international
   projects, which promoted gender equality by supporting women's
   integration into the new, capitalist economy. In the last decade,
   however, an increasing conditionality of funding and deteriorating
   donor-NGO relations has fueled local contestations of the international
   agenda. The donor-enhanced women's empowerment model, which fosters
   individual responsibility and self-reliance, is increasingly criticized
   for aggravating the conditions of local women in the context of a
   growing economic insecurity characterizing the local capitalist economy.
   Against this resentment, an alternative women's empowerment model,
   advancing gender equity based on complementarity of male and female
   social roles and stressing the importance of family as a safety net
   against economic precarity, is gaining prominence locally.},

Title = {Liberal land reform in Kazakhstan? The effect on land rental and credit

Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {138},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study analyses the effect of Kazakhstan's 2003-2005 agricultural
   land reform on land rental and credit market participation. Although the
   reform declared an intention to facilitate efficient land allocation, we
   observe a major land concentration. We analyze whether new land
   relations stimulated land sales and rental markets and made credit more
   accessible. Utilizing data from two independent surveys before and after
   private land ownership was introduced, we demonstrate that the reform
   did not affect the land sales market but reorganized the land-rental
   market in a top-down fashion with the state remaining the principal
   landlord. The reform did not achieve the goal of providing access to
   land for the more skilled producers and did little to facilitate the use
   of owned land as collateral. The reform achievements are modest and
   bolder steps will be necessary to improve the functioning of
   Kazakhstan's agricultural land markets. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published

Title = {Towards translanguaging in CLIL: a study on teachers' perceptions and
   practices in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUALISM},
Abstract = {Since its inception in the 1990s Content and Language Integrated
   Learning (CLIL) has transformed from an initiative to improve
   communicative competence in foreign languages into a complex
   language-aware construct in which translanguaging and curriculum
   integration are identifiable pedagogical practices. This shift of
   paradigm in its conceptualisation has run parallel to the inclusion of
   multilingual practices in education, and it has been influenced by the
   so-called multilingual turn. However, despite the conceptualisation of
   CLIL becoming more complex, and translanguaging making an interesting
   case for research in multilingual and CLIL scenarios, there is still a
   dearth of studies dealing with translingual practices in different
   contexts. This article reports the results of an exploratory qualitative
   study investigating CLIL teachers' perceptions on the pedagogical use of
   translanguaging and the impact of those perceptions on their teaching
   practices in different trilingual schools in Kazakhstan. Findings (1)
   showed that teachers' stance on translanguaging is rather ambiguous; and
   (2) led us to identify a set of teaching practices related to how
   teachers make use of translanguaging: exclusive use of the target
   language as an ideal (end-goal); translanguaging as a way of scaffolding
   content; translanguaging as a transitional practice (temporary fix) and
   code-switching; and translanguaging as a way to counter teachers' own
   language proficiency limits.},

Abstract = {The article explores the concept of neo-nomadic culture as a territorial
   brand for `authentic' Kazakhstan's tourism development. Using a
   qualitative methodology based on two case studies of eco-cultural tours,
   the article examines stakeholders' perceptions of authenticity of
   several heritage dimensions of nomadic culture and how these perceptions
   intersect with the notion of `terroir'. The article argues that

Abstract = {Two fungal-like organisms (class Oomycetes) and 263 species of fungi
   from 111 genera, 42 families, 23 orders, and 7 classes have been found
   on the territory of Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve. Twenty-two species are
   found for the first time. The vast majority of species are parasitic
   (202 species), 56 species belong to saprotrophs, and 7 to symbiotrophs.
   Classes Taphrinomycetes, Urediniomycetes, and Ustilaginomycetes are
   represented exclusively by parasites. There have been found 21
   saprotrophic, 27 parasitic, and 4 symbiotrophic species in the class
   Ascomycetes. The most numerous group in the class Basidiomycetes is the
   group of humus saprotrophs; it contains 15 species. Groups of litter
   saprotrophs and parasites contain four species each, symbiotrophic
   species have three species, coprotrophs and xylotrophs have two species
   each, and litter and humus saprotrophs have one species each. Anamorphic
   fungi are represented by 91 parasitic and 11 saprotrophic species. In
   comparison with closely located Sairam-Ugam National Park and the
   Karatau Nature Reserve, the mycobiota of Aksu-Zhabagly is characterized
   by a significant number of species in the classes Basidiomycetes,
   Urediniomycetes, Hyphomycetes, and Coelomycetes. Thirty-one species are
   common to these protected areas. The most numerous group is parasites.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to assess the developmental status
   of children living in the severely adverse environment of institutional
   care and the examination of risk factors with regard to developmental
   status, including degree of stunting and emotional-behavioral and anemia
   status. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were used to assess
   development status in 103 children aged 14.9 months (SD = 6.8) in six
   Kazakh institutions. The Behavioral Rating Scales were used to assess
   emotional-behavioral regulation. Physical growth measures were converted
   to z scores using World Health Organization growth charts. Venous blood
   was collected for assessment of anemia. Our findings indicated that
   young children in institutions were developmentally compromised, with
   duration of institutional care correlated with the severity of delay.
   Negative predictors of developmental status included: Poor
   emotional-behavioral regulation, degree of stunting and age at
   assessment. A particularly large percentage of children were found to be
   anemic. Additionally, low birth weight was found to be a significant
   negative predictor of development. Our findings indicate that
   institutional care has a detrimental impact on the development and
   emotional regulation of young children. Time in institutional care is a
   negative predictor for cognitive status for children placed at birth.
   Moreover stunting was found to be a useful indicator of the degree of
   impact of early adversity on cognitive development. Particular attention
   is needed for special-needs children such as those with low birth
   weight, since their development was found to be more sensitive to early
   adversity than that of normal birth weight children.},

Abstract = {The city of Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which has a population of
   804,474, and has been experiencing rapid growth over the last 15 years,
   generates approximately 1.39 kg capita(-1) day(-1) of municipal solid
   waste (MSW). Nearly 700 tonnes of MSW are collected daily, of which 97\%
   is disposed of at landfills. The newest landfill was built using modern
   technologies, including a landfill gas (LFG) collection system. The
   rapid growth of Astana demands more energy on its path to development,
   and the viability analysis of MSW to generate electricity is imperative.
   This paper presents a technical-economic pre-feasibility study comparing
   landfill including LFG utilization and waste incineration (WI) to
   produce electricity. The performance of LFG with a reciprocating engine
   and WI with steam turbine power technologies were compared through
   corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction, cost of energy
   production (CEP), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), net present value (NPV) and
   internal rate of return (IRR) from the analyses. Results demonstrate
   that in the city of Astana, WI has the potential to reduce more than
   200,000 tonnes of GHG per year, while LFG could reduce slightly less
   than 40,000 tonnes. LFG offers a CEP 5.7\% larger than WI, while the
   latter presents a BCR two times higher than LFG. WI technology analysis
   depicts a NPV exceeding 280\% of the equity, while for LFG, the NPV is
   less than the equity, which indicates an expected remarkable financial
   return for the WI technology and a marginal and risky scenario for the
   LFG technology. Only existing landfill facilities with a LFG collection
   system in place may turn LFG into a viable project.},

   This article describes the nutritional and developmental status of young
   children living in Baby Houses (orphanages for children ages 0-3 years)
   in Kazakhstan. In 2009/2010, 308 children under age 3 years living in 10
   Baby Houses were measured for height/length and weight. The Bayley
   Scales of Infant Development (N. Bayley, 2006) were used to assess
   mental and motor development. Blood was collected on a subsample to
   assess key nutritional factors. The World Health Organization growth
   charts were used to calculate Z-scores. Cut points for wasting (moderate
   to severe low weight for length/height growth), underweight (low weight
   for age), stunting (low length/height for age), development, and
   biomarkers used established guidelines. Most (n = 286) children had
   complete data on z-scores. Of these, 22.1\% were experiencing wasting,
   31.5\% were underweight, and 36.7\% had stunting. The nutritional status
   of the children, based on blood biomarkers, revealed that 37.1\% of the
   children were anemic, 21.4\% had low albumin, 38.1\% had low vitamin D,
   5.5\% were iodine-deficient, and 2\% had low serum zinc. One half had
   mild to significant mental and motor delays. Children living at these
   Baby Houses in Kazakhstan have substantial nutritional deficits and
   developmental delays. Focused attention is needed to provide a
   nutritionally enhanced diet and improved developmental opportunities to
   improve the long-term outcomes for these children.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that lack of any short-run and long-run

   in almost all 13 models, short-run asymmetric effects translate into the
   long run only in the trade with Austria, China, France, and the U.S.
   Only in the trade with France a tenge depreciation had favorable

Abstract = {Choice of modes is a critical decision that firms conducting
   equity-based foreign direct investment must make since it has a
   significant effect on performance. Entry mode choice has been a major
   topic in international business research up to now. As the largest
   economy in Central Asia, Kazakhstan became one of the main destinations
   for foreign direct investment in this area while transitioning to a
   market-based economy after gaining independence from the Soviet Union in
   1991. This paper investigates the main firm- and country-specific
   factors that affect the choice of equity-based entry modes of foreign
   investors entering Kazakhstan between a joint venture UV) and a
   wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS). We establish hypotheses regarding the
   effects of such factors on the mode choice and empirically test the
   hypotheses with secondary data on foreign companies' entry in
   Kazakhstan, using binomial logit regression analysis.},

Journal = {CHINA INFORMATION},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Amid the post-Cold War global revival of ethnonationalism, Kazakhstan -
   a newly independent state born out of the collapse of the Soviet Union -
   launched its `ethnic repatriation programme', encouraging ethnic Kazakhs
   from outside Kazakhstan to `return home'. China has a large ethnic
   Kazakh population and shares a border of more than 1500 km with
   Kazakhstan in Xinjiang. Since the 1990s, over 150,000 ethnic Kazakhs
   originally from China have chosen to emigrate to Kazakhstan. Sketching
   China's and Kazakhstan's state policies toward ethnic Kazakh migration
   since the 1990s, this article addresses how different factors and
   rationales have shaped individuals' decisions to emigrate to Kazakhstan
   or to stay in China. The article relies upon available, multilingual
   data and over 30 in-depth interviews with respondents in both Kazakhstan
   and China. We argue that, for ethnic Kazakhs emigrating from China to
   Kazakhstan, socio-economically and environmentally based rationales,
   including perceptions of developmental prospects, social welfare
   benefits and social ties were most salient during the 2000s. However,
   since the late 2000s, politico-culturally based rationales, such as
   ethno-nationalism, Kazakh linguistic and cultural concerns, educational
   opportunities, and other factors have become increasingly salient
   especially during the 2010s.},

Journal = {ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {174},
Number = {11-12},

Abstract = {The article deals with the development of public-private partnership in
   Kazakhstan on the basis of specialised institutional organisations, such
   as corporate social enterprises. The authors consider world experience
   of creating and functioning of regional development institutions, on the
   basis of which three main models of their organisation were determined.
   It has been established that Kazakhstan's model of corporate social
   enterprises has not become a full-fledged institution of regional
   development because of the inconsistent policy of the government. Based
   on the analysis of the main indicators of 16 corporate social
   enterprises throughout Kazakhstan, it has been found that most of them
   are still at the investment stage of their development and do not
   provide direct support to the entrepreneurship in their regions.
   Using the latest data and materials available regarding the corporation
   Saryarka of Karaganda region, Astana and Akmola region, the main
   directions of investment activities of the institute of regional
   development were identified, which showed the implementation of
   predominantly operator functions to redistribute public investment
   resources. In such a way, 53 subsidiaries, affiliates and associated
   enterprises of CSE Saryarka cover a variety of areas of economic
   activity, from the housing and utilities sector to the agro-industrial
   complex, metallurgy and metalworking. However, CSE Saryarka gradually
   reduces its participation in the investment of its subsidiaries: if
   there were 5 units in 2012, then in the 2015-2016 there were 3 units
   left, namely, Industrial Park Metallurgy-Metalworking, LLP Arka, and LLP
   SZTS Abaysky. The amount invested by the corporation in the authorised
   capital of these companies was decreasing. The main reason for the
   reduction of this type of assets is the return of assets to participants
   and the impairment as a result of unprofitable activities of the
   subsidiaries. Obviously, the capabilities of CSE Saryarka for this type
   of activity are not fully utilised, since the corporation is obliged to
   work with companies that perform a number of social functions at the
   current stage, which prevents them from being commercially successful in
   the market. It is quite possible to expand such activities for the CSE
   by involving it not only as a founder of special quasi-state structures
   but also as an investor in profitable commercially successful firms. The
   main criteria for selecting projects for the implementation in the
   Saryarka group are not only its financial profitability but also its
   strategic importance for the region.
   According to their initial task, corporate social enterprises as
   institutions fostering regional development are created in the form of
   holding companies, and their main activity is aimed at attracting
   investments to the region required for the implementation of
   infrastructure and innovative projects and promotion of small and
   medium-sized businesses' initiatives. However, the results of the study
   reveal systemic problems that prevent their absolute development as
   institutions fostering regional development. In view of the
   abovementioned facts, the authors of the research propose measures to
   address the related problems.},

Title = {Does reform in Kazakhstan improve access to childcare? Evidence from
   nationally-representative surveys},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {13-19},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {During Soviet era, Kazakhstan enjoyed universal free-of-charge access to
   childcare. After the commencement of economic and political transition,
   and the achievement of independence in 1991, attendance in childcare
   programs dropped significantly. This reduction in attendance was
   accompanied by a growing gap in access caused by wealth, language,
   mother's education, and regional disparities. Responding to the
   reduction in attendance as well as growing inequalities with respect to
   attendance, the government of Kazakhstan initiated a bold program of
   reforms aimed at improving access to childcare. This paper represents an
   initial assessment of the success of these reforms using a unique set of
   nationally-representative surveys. We found that, in general, the reform
   was successful in increasing childcare attendance. However, the results
   of the reform fell short of their target. However, the reform
   significantly reduced the role of household wealth as a barrier to
   attendance. Nevertheless, the wealth of a household remains an important
   determinant of attendance. Additionally, although the reform
   successfully mitigated gaps in attendance which were based on language
   spoken and education of mother, regional disparities remain significant.

Title = {How attractive are short-term CDM forestations in arid regions? The case
   of irrigated croplands in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {108-117},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study analyzed the financial attractiveness of Clean Development
   Mechanism Afforestation and Reforestation (CDM A/R) in irrigated
   agricultural settings. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of
   Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated by analyzing the case of Khorezm
   region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was
   established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon
   sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood
   were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the
   opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this
   short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the
   major crops in the region, i.e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize.
   The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation
   water availability, from 0 to 30,000 m(3)/ha, to reflect the reality of
   a high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R
   ranged between 724 and 5794 USD/ha over seven years, depending on the
   tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L had the highest
   profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit
   production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within
   399-702 USD/ha after the assumed 7-year crediting period and would not
   suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree
   plantations. IRR peaked at 65\% with E. angustifolia under the
   conventional afforestation and measured - 10\% and 61\% when considering
   only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species
   had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree
   plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with
   the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these
   crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option
   but required water input of 26,500 m(3)/ha/year, which is not
   consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current
   global average price of 4.76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate
   forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can
   still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation
   and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation
   needs of trees, 3-30\% of the crop water demand, a conversion of
   degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15,300 m3/ha/year
   at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and
   carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus
   enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and
   strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions
   of climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We analyze the effect of the receipt of remittances on the education and
   health of children in Kyrgyzstan during a volatile period of their
   recent history, 2005-2009. The country experienced revolution in 2005
   and the global financial crisis beginning in 2008. Both events impact
   human capital investment, and the changes vary by region of the country.
   We use fixed effects estimation and fixed effects, instrumental
   variables estimation to isolate the effects of remittances and other
   events on human capital. We find that boys aged 14-18 in remittances'
   receiving households are less likely to be enrolled in school than other
   children. We also find that girls in remittances' receiving households
   are more likely to be malnourished (thin). Both effects are relatively
   small. Remittances do not improve the human capital of children left
   behind. However, we do find an overall positive improvement in school
   enrollment among young children between 2005 and 2009 but a negative
   trend in enrollment among older boys and girls. Nutrition improves over
   time. Regional differences are apparent in these trends in nutrition and
   education. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 770-785. The

Abstract = {During the process of bridging conflicting water interests, cooperation
   and conflict tend to co-exist. The main aim of this research is to
   identify the reason behind the intensified water relationship between
   China and Kazakhstan. In this regard, the main research question is:
   what are the barriers hindering the implementation of Sino-Kazakhstan
   water allocation cooperation? In order to answer this question, the
   research applies a qualitative analysis approach to assemble the crucial
   descriptors that allow the main barriers to be categorized, such as
   appreciation of water, initial willingness, institutional conflict
   resolution, and bureaucratic system constraints. This is intended to
   provide an assessment of the motivation, organization, and
   implementation of Sino-Kazakhstan transboundary water management, based
   on interdisciplinary literature on water management and international
   law. This research ultimately finds that the opposite interests,
   reluctance, ambiguity in the legal framework, and poor
   intra-governmental coordination negatively impact the implementation of
   Sino-Kazakhstan water allocation cooperation.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan is a key player in the world agricultural markets, with
   considerable export potential in the wheat, beef and dairy sectors.
   Based on unique farm-level data covering all production systems, this
   chapter offers new insights into the constraints that hamper
   Kazakhstan's further economic growth and its integration into the global
   food trade. While a frequently mentioned bottleneck is agriculture's
   lacking access to finance, most farm managers are afraid to take loans.
   Unavailability of land is now the most cited constraint to land
   expansion in the highly regulated land market of the northern grain
   region. Another set of constraints in wheat production is related to the
   market power of elevators, the vagaries of - trading over long distances
   in an underdeveloped rail and seaport infrastructure and the
   intervention activities of state agencies. In the cattle sector, there
   are significant problems in year-round fodder supply. The value chains
   for beef and dairy are bifurcated into an import-dependent chain of
   industrially processed pro-ducts serving urban consumers, and a local
   chain of raw products serving rural consumers and urban bazaars. A more
   favourable economic environment for private/individual livestock farms
   requires simultaneous improvements on many fronts.},

   considered GDP indicators are interdependent variables with a close
   correlation. It was found that almost 90\% of the variance of the
   variables, estimated by their total dispersion, is a consequence of the
   influence of the three identified factors. The first factor explaining
   the variability of the main part of the variables, in our opinion, can
   be taken as the ``specific gravity{''} of the influence of natural and
   climatic conditions. Close correlation relationships have been
   established (correlation coefficients from -0,72 to -0,96) between the
   first factor and all variables of the ``productivity{''} group. The
   influence of the first factor is also noticeable in relation to GDP
   indicators, this can be judged by the values of the correlation
   coefficients: -0,85; -0,85; -0,85. Other identified factors show the
   level of influence of other objective reasons that are not yet amenable
   to logical explanation.},

Abstract = {The paper is devoted to the development of general methodological
   approaches to evaluate and identify the possibility for creating IT
   clusters in Kazakhstan regions. The present study considers the
   formation of IT clusters as growth poles. These poles are based on the
   establishing the groups of interconnected companies and institutions in
   IT industry linked by commonalities. The analysis of previous literature
   has shown that this approach is a novel approach to IT clusters
   formation. The study employs methods, which focus on analyzing and
   identifying IT clusters in the interests of innovative development and
   the possibility of spreading information technology in Kazakhstan
   regions. We propose the methodological tools for presenting a standard
   form to assess innovative potential and industry specialization. This
   assessment allows to objectively and realistically define a potentially
   important region for creating IT cluster. The empirical analysis has
   identified certain trends in possibilities to create IT clusters in the
   cities of Almaty and Astana. Therefore, these regions play the role of
   specialized platforms for a new generation. This platform is to provide
   a multiplier effect on the development of the agglomeration and located
   in close territories or periphery. The results of this research can be
   used to elaborate important strategic documents in the field of the
   development of the IT industry, digital technology, knowledge-based and
   high-tech sectors in Kazakhstan on the way to Industry 4.0.},

Abstract = {As a country with not only significant production potential but also
   fragmented land ownership, the Kyrgyz Republic struggles with
   environmental efficiency, which is a strategic element of environmental
   management in agricultural production. The objective of this study was
   to assess the environmental efficiency of sheep's wool when used as a
   fertilizer in bean production in northern Kyrgyzstan. In this study, the
   efficiency indicator was taken to be GHG emissions per functional unit
   of product, using a proprietary methodology for calculating GHG
   emissions to determine the true value of this material as a source of
   soil nutrients and organic matter. Two experimental factors were used in
   the experiment: fertilizer type and fertilizer rate. Fertilization with
   sheep wool resulted in a 15\% higher bean yield compared to when
   fertilized with mineral fertilizers at a comparable rate, converted to
   pure nitrogen. By using sheep wool as a source of mineral nutrients for
   the plants, the carbon footprint was reduced by almost 10\% compared to
   a facility with mineral fertilization. Therefore, the use of sheep wool
   as a source of plant nutrients is environmentally justified.},

Title = {Gender and the navigation of STEM careers in higher education
   institutions: Narratives of female faculty in post-Soviet Tajikistan},
Journal = {COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION},
Abstract = {The underrepresentation of female faculty in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines is a globally
   acknowledged gender equity concern; however, it remains under-researched
   in post-Soviet contexts. Using a theoretically informed analysis, this
   paper explores how female STEM faculty members navigate their gender
   identities in domestic and academic spheres in post-Soviet Tajikistan.
   In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 female
   faculty members. The results indicated that parental discourses and
   family circumstances enabled female faculty members to defy the gendered
   oppositional inscription of STEM, while the performance of non-hegemonic
   masculinities by spouses, male mentors, and academic supervisors
   supported their career advancement. However, the gendered micropolitics
   of higher education institutions significantly undermined the
   performance of female STEM faculty members' identity and subjected them
   to discrimination, marginalisation, and isolation.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to analyze the professional readiness of
   future high school educational psychologists for innovative management
   activities. The effectiveness of innovation management activities in the
   educational environment depends on educational psychologists' acquired
   competencies. The experimental study included a survey of 320 graduate
   students majoring in Pedagogy and Psychology at eight leading
   Kazakhstani universities and regional experts' assessment on the
   readiness of graduates for innovative managerial work in educational
   institutions. The sampling technique used to select the sample audience
   is the convenience based, exponential non-discriminative snowball
   sampling where the initial subjects are recruited from campus or through
   social groups based on ease of accessibility and the rest are selected
   based on referrals made by the selected students. The article reveals
   the importance of the personality component of educational
   psychologists' professional readiness for innovative management. In
   addition, it gives an expert assessment of the effectiveness of training
   educational psychologists for innovative management in educational
   institutions. Studying the future educational psychologists' readiness
   for innovative managerial competencies remains relevant for researchers.
   It is associated with the need for purposeful investigation and
   formation of professional competencies according to general patterns and
   alterations in vocational training in higher educational institutions.
   In this regard, educational psychologists' training with managerial
   competencies should become one of the priority directions of practical
   psychology development in Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Risk perception in practice of Polish MNCs in Kazakhstan during COVID-19
   time},
Journal = {EKONOMIA I PRAWO-ECONOMICS AND LAW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major crisis in global
   economy. The year 2020 will be remembered in the history of global
   economy as the year of a massive supply and demand shock, and,
   consequently, a slump in economic growth in most countries. The effects
   of the pandemic will be felt to varying degrees by the majority of the
   world's economic entities. One such effect is the radical decrease in
   global foreign direct invest-ment (FDI). It is hard to assess now how
   heavily the pandemic will influence the long-term FDI trends. The
   perception of the pandemic risk is, however, likely to heighten. This
   article deals with foreign direct investment risks, and more
   specifically, with the pandem-ic risk seen as one of natural risks in
   COVID-19-related contexts.Aim: The article aims to identify how the
   enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan perceive the pandemic risk
   in comparison with other FDI risks. The authors of this paper were
   co-investigators on a scientific research project concerning FDI in
   Kazakhstan as exemplified by the investment intensity of Polish
   enterprises. The project was carried out from 2019 to 2021, i.e., when
   the pandemic started and during its course. The research concept was,
   however, created before there were any signs of the pandemic. Therefore,
   the research questions regarding FDI risk in Kazakhstan were not to any
   extent inspired by this occurrence. Nevertheless, the question about the
   pandemic risk was included in the research tool. Thus, the perception of
   this risk became the subject of research. The findings of partial
   research that are presented in this article are original in nature,
   because the assessments constituting their basis were formulated at a
   time when Kazakh-stan, like other countries around the world, struggled
   with the pandemic and when its effects were unknown.Results: According
   to the enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan, the main ar-eas of
   risk entailed in their operation in this country were, most importantly,
   the risks of the investment country and global risks. Local currency
   exchange risk ranked 1st; as many as 70\% of respondents said that this
   risk perception was high. This was followed by global economic events
   (e.g. depression), performance risks (e.g. product price, transfer
   risks, the price of capital) and government policy risks (e.g. tax
   reforms, monetary re-forms, price controls, trade restrictions,
   nationalisation, government regulation, barriers to earnings
   repatriation). The 5th most distinctly perceived risk by the studied
   enterprises was global social events risks, including the pandemic risk.
   40\% of the surveyed entities defined this risk perception as high, and
   30\% each as medium and small. The fact that the pandemic risk ranked
   5th among other FDI risk components in Kazakhstan indicates its great
   significance to the enterprises operating there at an early stage of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., when the level of uncertainty caused by the
   pandemic in terms of both its economic and its social effects was very
   high.},

   examines the risks and consequences of various trends in the development
   of national and global energy. Previous studies have shown that
   government efforts are insufficient in developing an alternative energy

   transform energy production from traditional sources towards greater
   efficiency and environmental friendliness, as well as the active
   involvement of the business community in the development of an
   alternative energy market. This is expected to attract more investments

Abstract = {This essay engages critically with the personal narratives of rodina
   (home, motherland) among Russian-speaking youth in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan. It is argued that the concept of rodina as an important
   locus of belonging cannot be imbued with a single meaning; instead, it
   is characterised by internal conflicts and variations. Supported by
   empirical material, the essay moves beyond the confines of `nation' and
   `nationality' to illustrate the different ways in which Russian speakers
   frame their perception of rodina, and how such narratives can influence
   the construction of self- and community-identification.},

Abstract = {Economic diversification in resource-dependent countries is a difficult
   process. Most of these countries' efforts to diversify have been
   unsuccessful. Alberta is one exception. It has succeeded in diversifying
   its economy by ``diversifying in energy{''} using explicit policy
   decisions to promote human capital development in science, technology,
   engineering, and math (STEM), complement STEM education with education
   in management and innovation, foster proper market discipline, establish
   an effective intellectual property rights system, and strengthen links
   between various industries to support innovation. Kazakhstan's policy
   makers can learn valuable lessons from Alberta's successes. It is also
   important to understand that some of the initiatives that were
   successful in Alberta may not be appropriate for Kazakhstan because of
   the latter's system of state-guided capitalism and limited public
   service capacity. Finally, evidence from Alberta suggests that promoting
   ``winning{''} sectors is a way for favored insiders to capture a share
   of resource rent and seldom succeed.},

Title = {Assessing the potential of trees for afforestation of degraded

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Land degradation is a serious hindrance to agricultural development in
   Uzbekistan, a country striving to rebuild its agricultural sector for
   self-sustained production. The potential of multipurpose trees for
   upgrading degraded land is enormous. However, knowledge is lacking about
   the establishment and growth characteristics of different species, the
   energy content of firewood and the nutritive value of fodder. This study
   presents such data for 10 selected local multipurpose species grown on
   gleyic solonchak soil. Elaeagnus angustifolia L. and Tamarix androssowii
   showed superior biomass growth, respectively producing up to 11.0 and
   10.4 t ha(-1) of utilizable aboveground dry matter (DM). E. angustifolia
   showed high potential for rapid establishment evidenced by root
   elongation of over 100 m tree(1)at the age of 3 years. T. androssowii,
   Prunus armeniaca L. and Populus nigra var. pyramidalis Spach exhibited
   the greatest fuelwood characteristics, showing calorific values in the
   range of 14.4 - 16.2 MJ DM kg(-1). E. angustifolia and Morus alba L.
   demonstrated superior fodder potential given by the crude protein
   content of 216 and 117 g DM kG(-1). Recommendations on species selection
   are proposed based on various species characteristics. In assessing the
   potential of trees for afforestation of degraded land a reliable
   economic analysis of these aspects must be taken into account. When
   considering all characteristics concurrently, a mixture of species
   instead of monocrop cultivation seems to provide the best solution for
   improving degraded land.},

Title = {Nudging student recycling behaviour: An experimental study in Kazakhstan
   and UK higher education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {377},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {We study the effects of influencing the recycling decisions of young
   people in the UK and Kazakhstan Universities using a public good
   experiment with an information nudge (through a video) and a peer effect
   nudge. Kazakhstan recycles approximately 15\% of its municipal waste,
   compared to almost half in the UK; however, surprisingly, overall
   contributions are significantly higher from Kazakh students compared to
   those from UK students. An information video on recycling prompts Kazakh
   students to contribute more while no such effect is found with the UK
   students. This suggests that Kazakh students may perceive themselves to
   be more capable of recycling despite a less sophisticated recycling
   system compared to the UK. A strong peer effect is seen across both
   countries. The study highlights the importance of subjective norms
   through peer nudge and the likelihood of higher contributions from
   students with siblings. A wider implication is that emerging economies'
   educational institutions may have latent positive environmental and
   recycling practices that developed nations could learn from. The study
   has implications for educational development as well as national
   recycling policy frameworks.},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Following their independence, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, which place
   great importance to oil industry, have also succeeded in attracting
   foreign investments to this industry. Over time, this industry, which
   has become a key to the economy, has made the economy vulnerable
   particularly to oil prices. In this regard, current paper investigates
   causal relationships between quarterly time series of oil prices, GDP
   and exchange rate for both Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan separately.
   Toda-Yamamoto causality test results for Azerbaijan suggest that there
   are unidirectional causalities from exchange rate to oil prices, from
   oil prices to GDP and from GDP to exchange rate. As for Kazakhstan,
   causalities run from oil prices to GDP, exchange rate to GDP and oil
   prices to exchange rate.},

Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {178-188},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study presents a practical approach to oil wealth management by
   bringing together various dimensions (oil production and sustainability
   of oil reserves, impact on the economy and the balance of trade, and the
   impact on the fiscal balance, government debt, and the national oil
   fund) within a long-term planning framework The study provides a
   quantitative depiction of the above dimensions to 2050 for the case of
   Kazakhstan where the country's oil output has grown from about 0.6
   million barrels/day (mb/d) in the late 1990s to 1.8 (mb/d) in 2013, and
   it is expected to reach a peak of 3.5 mb/d by 2035. The analysis of this
   study indicates that within the limits of proven oil reserves,
   Kazakhstan's oil production capacity would collapse to negligible
   amounts after the peak period of 2035. This envisaged scenario will have
   undesirable impacts on the economy, balance of trade and fiscal balance
   both prior and after 2035. To avoid these erratic impacts, the study
   examines an alternative ``conservative{''} production scenario that
   would enable the country to maintain its level of oil production until
   2050, and to manage better the transition to a non-oil economy. (C) 2014

   AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN KAZAKHSTAN},

Abstract = {While academic achievement and performance of students in higher
   education settings continue to be crucial, there is a growing emphasis
   internationally on the acquisition of non-cognitive skills of future
   specialists. Perhaps, one of the most widely discussed soft skills is
   Emotional Intelligence ({''}EI{''}). Despite being recognized as an
   independent concept since the second part of the twentieth century, most
   experts in the spheres of psychology, education and management still
   find this area somewhat ambiguous. Several studies focused on the
   relationship between emotional intelligence and academic achievement
   before. However, very little research in this sphere has been conducted
   in Kazakhstan. While the gap in scholarship is evident, the praxis is
   also underdeveloped.
   This study utilized a cross-sectional correlational design {[}1,2,3].
   The purpose of the study was to identify the relationship between
   emotional intelligence and academic achievement among undergraduate
   students. To achieve this, we administered the ESAP (Emotional Skills
   Assessment Process) questionnaire that focuses on four main
   competencies: interpersonal, leadership, self-management, and
   intrapersonal. We used the self-reported indicators to obtain
   information about students' academic achievement.
   We collected data in two Kazakhstani universities for confidentiality
   purposes called the Autonomous University and the Regional University.
   The sample consisted of 239 undergraduate students, 141 and 98
   undergraduates from two universities (Regional and Autonomous),
   respectively. The sample was recruited on a non-probability basis due to
   the voluntary participation in the research study and the unavailability
   of the sampling frames. We used the Statistical Package for the Social
   Sciences (SPSS) for descriptive, inferential, and correlational
   statistical analyses of the collected data. The study presents
   information on the general emotional intelligence levels of
   undergraduate students of two universities. Similarly, the research
   study identifies three levels of academic achievement of students: high,
   average, and low achieving and establishes their correlation with
   emotional intelligence competencies and levels. Furthermore, the study
   explores students' emotional intelligence levels differentiated by such
   independent variables as their age and gender.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study of the religious preferences
   of student youth on the example of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The
   Republic of Kazakhstan is a young state at the junction of two
   continents of Asia and Europe, which is home to 130 ethnic groups,
   professing more than 18 different faiths. It is one of the states that
   managed to avoid interethnic and interfaith conflicts in the process of
   secession from the USSR. However, the current religious situation is
   characterized by the emergence and strengthening of radical Islamist
   religious communities, the intensification of the activities of centres
   of non-traditional beliefs, the increasing influence of the foreign
   missionary movement and the expansion of the social base of sectarian
   organizations, especially at the expense of young people. Therefore, the
   authors have selected the student youth represented by young Kazakh and
   Russian students as the object of their study. The problems of studying
   the specifics and characteristics of the religious preferences of youth
   have a pronounced interdisciplinary nature. The fundamental difference
   about the methodology of socio-psychological research is that the focus
   here is not just the problem of religious identity in itself, but its
   internal reflection and perception by individuals as members of
   different ethnic and religious groups. If other branches of scientific
   knowledge are limited only by the statement of the presence of certain
   religious preferences, then only Psychology, exploring their internal
   content, which determines confessional behaviour, can give the most
   accurate forecast for their further development. Therefore, the study of
   religious preferences as a special subject of socio-psychological
   research seems relevant both in theoretical terms and in the context of
   applied empirical research.},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Many building assessment tools exist for guiding building facilities
   toward sustainability. Some tools are internationally recognized while
   others are for specific countries based on local needs. This study
   endeavored to develop a building sustainability assessment framework for
   Kazakhstan. The framework was developed based on the review of building
   performance assessment methods such as leadership in energy and
   environmental design (LEED), building research establishment
   environmental assessment methodology (BREEAM), comprehensive assessment
   system for building environmental efficiency (CASBEE), and international
   initiative for sustainable built environment (SBTool), and considering
   the local conditions in Kazakhstan. A two-round Delphi survey was
   employed to develop the assessment categories and indicators by local
   experts from the architecture, engineering, and construction industry.
   Mean and standard deviation values were used to analyze the survey data
   and to make the decision on the level of agreement amongst the Delphi
   panelists. The proposed framework consists of nine assessment
   categories, 46 assessment indicators, and 142 parameters covering the
   four climatic regions in Kazakhstan and considering the environmental,
   social, and economic perspectives of the country's sustainable
   development goals. The introduction of the framework is expected to
   serve as a reference for establishing the regional building
   sustainability assessment tool that will aid to increase the awareness
   of the public and help policymakers to solve sustainability-related
   issues in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {After 25 years of stagnation, Uzbekistan's educational system is
   currently undergoing significant reforms. This study is probably the
   first research on preschool teachers' beliefs and practice regarding
   emergent literacy in Uzbekistan. We adapted the Preschool Literacy
   Survey (Norway) model and surveyed preschool teachers in the
   Surkhandarya region of Uzbekistan before and after our short-term
   training programme. Findings demonstrated much uncertainty in teachers'
   beliefs and a mismatch between their practice and best research-based
   standards, as measured by descriptive statistics. Although the training
   improved some indices in their beliefs and practice, the overall
   assessment result of most teachers was still unsatisfactory. Our
   analysis attributes this to the lack of high-quality research-based
   training programmes on emergent literacy, teachers' misconception of
   their role in developing emergent literacy, the absence of emergent
   literacy-oriented environments and curricula and an immature publishing
   industry for children in Uzbekistan. This case shows that rapid
   educational reforms after a long stagnation may fail if teachers'
   beliefs and practice are not considered and improved accordingly.},

Title = {Resilient route selection of oversized cargo transport: the case of

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {410-430},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Resilient route selection for oversized cargoes, one of the
   general bulk cargoes, has not been adequately optimized in terms of
   using the Arctic route. This study solves the problem of selecting the
   optimal shipping routes for oversized cargoes from Busan (South Korea)
   to Balkhash (Kazakhstan). Design/methodology/approach The study used the
   consistent fuzzy preference relation (CFPR) method, which is used to
   solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and uncertainty problems, to
   tackle the route selection. This method involves three procedures:
   first, the critical factors and alternative routes were obtained by the
   previous literature and an in-depth interview of experts of oversized
   cargo-handling with more than 20 years of working experience; second,
   the weightings for each critical factor were identified using the CFPR
   calculation process and third, alternative routes were evaluated using
   weighted critical factors. Findings The Northern Sea Route (NSR)
   combined with the inland waterways of Russia and Kazakhstan was first
   suggested for bulk carriers that handle oversized cargoes. The NSR could
   be a suitable route from Busan to Cape Kamenny of the Russian
   transshipment seaport, where oversized cargoes will be transferred to
   the river barge at Cape Kamenny, covering 4,913 km from the latter to
   Balkhash of Kazakhstan via the Ob/Irtysh River. Practical implications
   This study equips stakeholders in route selection for cargoes with
   strategies and methods to improve transportation efficiently and enhance
   shipping routes between Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
   (CIS). In addition to oversized cargoes, coal and timber from Russia can
   be transported to Asia using inland waterways and the NSR, which can
   also be used to transport plant equipment for petroleum refineries among
   Asian countries. Originality/value This is the first study to evaluate
   the suitability of the Artic route for oversized cargoes from South
   Korea to Kazakhstan. It provides a comprehensive evaluation framework of
   multimodal shipping routes and offers references for decision-makers
   when dealing with similar problems.},

Abstract = {This article is situated in a growing body of literature, focusing on
   higher education reforms in countries which emerged, or re-emerged, 25
   years ago as the Soviet Union dissolved. With the focus specifically on

   this country views a higher education funding model- the state grants.
   The paper applies the lenses of stability, performance and innovation
   orientation to the examination of the state grants-based higher
   education funding model in Kazakhstan. This paper finds that despite
   recognition of the limitations of the existing funding model, there is
   limited interest to push for changes. This can be explained by the
   complex higher education policy environment which is also discussed in
   this paper.},

Abstract = {The dynamic competitiveness of Kazakhstan's engineering-based firms is
   assessed on the basis of their prospects for technological evolution in
   terms of a simple, three-level taxonomy of goods - simple
   inputs/components, complex inputs/components and,specialist supplier
   goods'. On the assumption that real wages in Kazakhstan will grow
   steadily and significantly over the foreseeable future, Kazakhstan firms
   will be forced to move up the `technological ladder' to maintain
   competitiveness. The article concludes that a number of the targeted
   firms show clear potential for dynamic competitiveness. None, however,
   is fulfilling all the conditions for dynamic competitiveness at the
   present time. One of the main underlying factors tending to weaken the
   competitiveness of Kazakhstan companies is a historically conditioned
   tendency to isolation, which has effectively excluded networking as it
   operates in the advanced industrial economies. While the importance of
   human capital and human capital formation is generally recognised in the
   targeted companies, public policy in this area is perceived as being
   highly ineffective, in a situation where the companies themselves do not
   have sufficient resources to fund all the training they need.},

Abstract = {From the earliest days of the Soviet Union, the people of Tajikistan
   were allowed to have small ``kitchen gardens{''} attached to their homes
   or in the vicinity of their apartments in which they could augment their
   diets with fresh food and also keep a milk cow and perhaps chickens.
   Over time however, families began to produce far more than they needed
   and would sell the surplus in local markets, along roads, and even in
   nearby cities-an early example of market-oriented, investment
   agriculture in Central Asia. By the end of the Soviet era, as much as
   one third of food sold in the markets was from kitchen gardens. In
   post-independence Tajikistan, these gardens have allowed families facing
   civil war, drought, and demodernization to feed themselves and earn some
   extra income. This paper describes the historic geography, layout and
   crops of kitchen gardens, and provides quantitative data on the economic
   importance of these gardens.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic
   on the city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan and by adopting an institutional
   approach, to generate solutions that might contribute to the future
   development of the tourism and hospitality industries. A computer-based
   survey was developed and administered online using the Google Forms
   platform. The survey consisted of the following questions: (1) reactions
   to the pandemic's influence on tourism (2) short-term recovery plans (3)
   long-term challenges, and (4) demographic characteristics of
   respondents. Surveys were distributed to email addresses of over 150
   tourism managers and employees in Uzbekistan in June, 2020. A final
   total of 77 responses were found acceptable for analysis. Findings
   identified a number of institutions used as a response to the pandemic:
   additional state support for entrepreneurs, webinars, new investment
   projects, post-crisis measures, actions aimed at improving the product,
   and marketing campaigns to promote the tourism product. Several
   initiatives were instituted by Samarkand Regional Government including
   support for entrepreneurs and small business owners through start-up
   investment projects. However, overall, a lack of trust was shown between
   the tourism owners/providers and regional government with the majority
   of owners preferring to solve their own problems that were created as a
   result of the pandemic.},

   economic contacts with its neighboring countries (Tajikistan,

   suggests that Uzbekistan should strive to increase trade with

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-160},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines limitations in how law enforcement and public health
   systems respond to domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Findings from
   interviews with domestic violence victims show that these women are
   subject to ineffectual practices and negative attitudes that tend to
   minimize domestic abuse and disempower victims. The findings reveal
   several problematic issues: inconsistencies in the implementation of the
   law, impunity for abusers because of both personal attitudes and social
   affinities between the police and abusers, ineffective enforcement of
   protective orders, and superficial processing of domestic violence cases
   by the legal system. Additional barriers to help-seeking include a lack
   of institutional support and guidelines for offering mental health
   services for victims as well as a scarcity of housing, childcare, and
   employment opportunities for women seeking to break the cycle of abuse.
   The findings underscore the need for society-wide changes in attitudes
   toward domestic violence, stricter mechanisms for enforcing the law, and
   mandatory training for service providers to facilitate the provision of
   more accessible and affirmative support to victims.},

Title = {Does country-of-origin matter in the era of globalisation? Evidence from
   cross sectional data in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL \& DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {262-277},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the consistency over
   time of customer attitude towards country-of-origin in a transitional
   economy.
   Design/methodology/approach A single cross-sectional study in Uzbekistan
   was carried out, with n=527, consisting of 374 street and 153 online
   surveys, replicating a study carried out 20 years earlier.
   Findings Whilst consumers still perceive products from advanced
   countries to have higher quality, quality perception in relation to
   country-of-origin information is dynamic and transitional countries can
   improve the perception of consumers towards their national brands.
   Research limitations/implications This study was carried out in
   Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, the most populous of the Central
   Asian republics. Researchers may wish to extend it by examining COO
   effects in other transitional economies, and additionally to examine the
   effect of country-of-brand origin.
   Practical implications Customer perceptions and attitudes take a
   long-time to evolve. This cross-sectional study showed that the COO
   perception of China has improved significantly and the perception
   towards the products produced locally in Uzbekistan has also slightly
   improved across all categories. Strong brands can contribute to the
   image of the country. Transition countries need to take appropriate
   marketing actions to cultivate positive perception through innovation
   and branding.
   Originality/value Prior research has been extended by adding new product
   categories such as mobile phones, computers, washing machines and air
   conditioners. This research shows that government officials and
   exporters in developing countries should prioritise strengthening their
   country's image to help domestic marketers export and attract foreign
   investors. The authors provide insights for marketers to understand the
   impact of product country-of-origin on customer purchase intention and
   its antecedents in transitional economies, such as Uzbekistan.},

Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the topical issues of training of the highly
   qualified personnel in the postgraduate study in Russia and Tajikistan.
   The model of training of highly qualified specialists (postgraduate
   study) in Russia and many foreign countries, including former USSR
   Republics developed years ago. But now it requires serious changes.
   Changes in pedagogics, changes in the labour market are considered in
   the article, It becomes obvious, that the preparation of scientific
   personnel for various types of research activity, within one programme
   is getting more difficult. The authors carried out the research within
   the Erasmus+ project ``Capacity building: Improvement of quality of
   engineering education through training of teachers and new pedagogical
   approaches in Russia and Tajikistan{''} / EXTEND. One part of this
   research was aimed on the analysis of situation of training of highly
   qualified personnel in the postgraduate schools of Russia and
   Tajikistan. In particular, the following tasks were formulated: - to
   determine the directions of career development, which the applicants to
   the post graduate school plan to realize; - to reveal the opinion of
   graduate students on the quality of training in the postgraduate school.
   The specially developed questionnaire, containing 22 items was used for
   the sociological poll among the graduate students. According to the poll
   results not all the post-graduate students are satisfied with the
   process. There is the need of reorganization of the postgraduate study
   in both countries.},

   management under multiple uncertainties-A case study in Amu Darya River

Abstract = {Water and land are the two most critical resources for food production
   and they are intricately linked. Irrigation expansion, population
   growth, and climate change are threatening the sustainability of
   water-land nexus system (WLNS). In this study, a possibilistic-flexible
   chance-constrained programming (PFCP) method that is capable of
   addressing multiple uncertainties expressed as possibilistic
   distributions, flexible variables, and probabilistic distributions
   existed in WLNS is developed. PFCP can help gain in-depth analysis of
   the tradeoffs between system benefit and reliability of satisfying
   constraints. Then, the proposed PFCP method is applied to the lower
   reaches of Amu Darya River basin for assessing the impact of irrigation
   efficiency on the WLNS management, where 1080 scenarios are analyzed in
   association with different irrigation schemes, violation risk levels,
   and satisfactory degrees. A number of water and land resources
   allocation alternatives for different irrigation districts and crops are
   generated. Results indicate that the advanced irrigation modes (e.g.,
   sprinkle and drip) can improve irrigation efficiency and raise unit
   water benefit from 0.15 US\$/m(3) to 0.24 US\$/m(3). Irrigation mode
   with efficiency of about 0.61 is an effective option in adaption to
   changed water availabilities, which is beneficial for pursuing balance
   between water and land relationships. These findings can support
   decision makers implementing comprehensive agricultural management
   strategies (e.g., the advancement of irrigation modes as well as the
   optimization of water and land allocation patterns) in responding to
   variations in water availability, electricity consumption, and market
   price.},

Abstract = {The drying up of the Aral Sea has been described as one of the most
   staggering environmental disasters of the twentieth century. Over the
   last 40 years over 36 000 km(2) of the former seabed have been exposed,
   creating a potentially significant aeolian dust source. It is widely
   believed, but little researched, that increased dust storm activity in
   the region has had a major impact on human health. In this paper we
   report the findings of a study into the link between dust exposure and
   respiratory health amongst children in the Autonomous Republic of
   Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan located on the southern shore of the Aral
   Sea. The findings indicate that dust deposition rates across the region
   are high, with sites located near the former shore of the sea being the
   worst affected. For these northerly regions the former bed of the Aral
   Sea is the most likely source of dust. The situation for the rest of the
   country appears to be far more complex. In these regions it appears that
   local sources and more distant sources to the south and south-west
   represent significant sediment providers, particularly in the early
   summer. Provisional analysis of the respiratory health data suggests
   that children living in the north of the country, where aeolian dust
   deposition rates are greater, show a lower frequency of respiratory
   problems. This inverse relationship requires further investigation, but
   highlights the complexities of environmental and human health
   inter-relationships.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a study on the effects of farm
   practices on drinking water quality in the Bukhara and Kashkadarya
   provinces of Uzbekistan. These two provinces are the largest irrigation
   districts in Uzbekistan and, in 1999, withdrew more than 10 cubic
   kilometers. (km(3)) of irrigation water from the Amu Darya River Cotton
   is the major irrigated crop grown in these districts and has required
   the application of large quantities of fertilizers and pesticides. These
   irrigation practices resulted in 2 km(3) of discharge water draining
   directly into the Amu Darya River and an equal amount of discharge water
   draining into natural lowlands in the region. Drinking water quality has
   worsened dramatically because of these discharges. The main pollutant
   components originated from mineral fertilizers and chemicals, which were
   applied on the irrigated lands. The amount and type of chemicals present
   in the drainage water can be linked to the agricultural production
   systems in the region.},

   framework. It analyses how the interplay between three factors - ideas,
   capabilities and circumstantial factors such, as the personalities of
   leading politicians, - shape the process of interaction between great
   powers. It starts from a comparison of the images of the two regions in
   Russia's mind-set because such images provide cognitive lenses through
   which powers make sense of political developments in shared
   neighbourhoods. The article then moves to show how change in the balance
   of power (soft and hard) created enabling conditions for
   competition/collaboration. Finally, the article shows how specific
   circumstantial factors led to or shaped the Russian-European conflict.
   At the same time, similar factors prevented Russian-Chinese conflict in

Abstract = {This study contributes to the literature on the evaluation of the
   effects of the stable and competitive real exchange rate management
   (SCRER) on economic growth by studying the exporting performance of the
   tradable sector in Kazakhstan between 2009 and 2019. We also aim to
   capture the impact of a significant change in the behavior of the
   exchange rate in August of 2015, following the introduction of inflation
   targeting monetary policy and switching to the flexible exchange rate
   regime of domestic currency - tenge. Our results show that a 10\%
   undervaluation of the RER leads to a 0.05 percentage points increase in
   the growth rate of manufacturing exports. At the same time, a one
   percent increase in RER leads to a 0.08 percentage points growth in
   primary products industries, while a depreciation of the RER by one
   percent leads to a rise of 0.14 percentage points in the growth rate of
   high-tech manufacturing industries. We also find that a highly volatile
   exchange rate regime of the exchange rate is not favorable to the
   development of capital-intensive sectors. Overall, the results suggest
   that a macroeconomic policy targeting a stable and competitive real
   exchange rate can be beneficial for the advancement of higher
   technologically intensive sectors, increased price competitiveness for
   Kazakhstan's manufacturing goods and high-skill tradable services, and
   the process of rapid capital accumulation.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {493-510},
Abstract = {In the nineteenth century, European doctors began to credit kumiss
   (fermented mare's milk) for the apparent absence of tuberculosis among
   the nomads of the Eurasian steppe. As European and American medical
   journals published articles on the `kumiss cure' and Russian doctors
   opened kumiss sanatoria, praise for the drink's curative powers was
   wound together with romanticized images of the nomadic pastoralists
   whose creation it was. In Soviet and now in post-Soviet Kazakhstan,
   kumiss came to hold the double status of medicine and of national
   heritage. Yet if in the nineteenth century, the steppe was notable for

   polytechnization, as well as flexibility in the use of Soviet
   institutions, the internats were transformed from a purely Soviet
   project into a more inclusive Soviet-Tajik project at the national level
   for the training of new young national-Sovietized professionals. These
   professionals combined the qualities of Sovietized and local (national),
   with their distinctive norms, traditions and values, into a totally new
   form. The boarding school system turned into a factory for bringing up
   national-Sovietized specialists and cadres.},

Abstract = {The necessity of developing measures for the regional development of
   Kyrgyzstan, increasing the economic potential, and improving the
   infrastructure for industrial and social purposes is shown. In this
   regard, the development and revival of the economies of towns, including
   small ones, are considered as a priority direction in the implementation
   of these goals. It was revealed that the small towns of the country, due
   to the diversity of historical formation, economic-geographic location
   (EGP), and socioeconomic values, differ from each other. Their main
   problems are the lack of economic assets, the scarcity of the city
   budget, remoteness from large centers, unemployment, and a decrease in
   living standards. The necessity of a comprehensive study of the
   potential and development prospects of small towns has been
   substantiated; a thorough analysis of their economic and geographic
   position is considered as the most important. As a result, the
   individual features of these towns were revealed. For this purpose, a
   study was made of the economic and geographic positions of small towns
   in the southern region of Kyrgyzstan concerning their status regarding
   transport, industrial, agricultural assessment, recreational, market and
   innovation relations. The results showed that the towns in the region
   range from 3.8 (Kochkor-Ata) to 2.3 points (Sulukta) according to the
   degree of EGP by components. To generalize these series, the towns were
   combined into three groups: those with the most advantageous economic
   and geographic location; those with a favorable economic and geographic
   location; and towns with a relatively favorable economic and geographic
   position. It was shown that the degree of profitability of the economic
   and geographic position of small towns in the region does not have a
   territorial sequence, i.e., it is not determined by the
   ``center-periphery{''} pattern. The study enabled the determination of
   the general potential for the development of the urban economy, planning
   the construction of infrastructure facilities, and revival of the
   industrial sector of the economy as a city-forming factor.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {255},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The Paris Agreement aims to increase global participation in climate
   change actions, yet attentions are not equally given among countries.
   The knowledge gap remains in understanding the structure and drivers of
   the emission in small developing countries. Eighteen countries have
   failed to ratify their Intended National Determined Contributions
   (INDCs) as an officially recognized emission target. Among these
   countries, we chose Kyrgyzstan as a case to construct its emission
   inventories from both production-based and consumption-based
   perspectives and to identify the drivers of emission changes using
   structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The empirical results revealed
   that CO2 emissions in Kyrgyzstan depicted a wavelike rise from 2007 to
   2015, whilst the production structure contributed to 14\% of the
   production-based CO2 emission growth from 2012 to 2015. As a net
   emission importer, Kyrgyzstan transferred large quantities of CO2
   emissions to China and Russia through imports. However, if all
   manufacturing imports were produced within Kyrgyzstan, the emission
   would be over five times compared to the current level. It is helpful to
   reduce global emissions for Kyrgyzstan to import goods from other
   countries whose carbon intensities are lower. Overall, this study
   highlights the need to focus on these countries' failure to ratify INDCs
   while calling the Paris Agreement to provide a better understanding and
   mitigation mechanism for these small developing countries.},

Abstract = {Purpose Research with survivors of domestic violence (DV) suggests that
   most do not seek supportive services from formal organizations. The
   purpose of this study is to understand the structural and legal barriers
   that prevent survivors of DV from seeking help in Kyrgyzstan from the
   perspectives of professionals within the areas of law enforcement,
   judicial system, social, health, and educational sectors working
   directly with survivors.
   Methods We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews and 8 focus groups
   with 83 professionals who are employed as domestic violence or legal
   advocates, psychologists, healthcare providers, educators, and law
   enforcement officials who had worked with the survivors of DV in their
   current positions. We analyzed the data using a multistep strategy
   derived from grounded theory methods.
   Results The findings of the study highlighted six structural barriers:
   (1) financial dependence on the abuser, (2) stigma and shame of seeking
   help, (3) few crisis centers and rigid acceptance criteria for temporary
   protection, (4) the normalization and societal acceptance of abuse, (5)
   a lack of property rights for women, and (6) distrust of formal
   services. The participants indicated five legal barriers, including the
   following: (1) insufficient sanctions for abusers, (2) unclear
   provisions and inadequate enforcement of law, (3) a low likelihood of
   prosecution, (4) poor procedures, stereotypes of survivors, and
   revictimization during investigations, and (5) protection for abusers
   who work in positions of power.
   Conclusions The structural and legal barriers that survivors face when
   seeking help are formidable challenges that will require extensive
   support from professionals working in the fields of criminal justice,
   social work, and public health. Findings suggest that both short-term
   and longer-term interventions that require sustainability of prevention
   efforts are necessary to address barriers to help-seeking identified in
   the study.},

Abstract = {How do fluctuations in income affect labor supply decisions, and how do
   their effects differ by gender? This study analyzes data from a
   thirteen-year rolling panel in Kyrgyzstan spanning 2004-16. It addresses
   the endogeneity of fluctuations in income to labor supply decisions by
   employing shift share instruments that exploit region-level changes over
   time in growth rates of different sources of revenue and production
   costs. Estimating a household fixed effects model, the study finds that
   reductions in income relative to the median spur departure from the
   household (for example, due to migration), with smaller impacts on women
   than men. However, women's labor supply at the origin is affected
   significantly more, with short-term increases in hours of employment and
   declines in home production and other activities. Reductions in income
   also fuel temporary migration for both genders, with larger effects for
   men, and widen the gender gap in pursuit of non-compulsory education.},

Title = {Household Members' Migration and the Education of Children Left Behind':
   Empirical Findings from Tajikistan and Reflections for Research Practice},
Journal = {POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE},

Abstract = {There is growing recognition that when a household member migrates,
   there is a complex range of social as well as economic consequences for
   the everyday lives of those who remain in the origin household. This
   paper examines the children left behind phenomenon in Tajikistan, a
   country with very high rates of international labour migration. With the
   use of data from the Tajikistan 2007 Living Standards Survey, logistic
   regression modelling is applied to examine the impact of fathers',
   mothers', siblings', and other household members' migration on the
   school enrolment of secondary school-aged children. The results show
   that there is a significant positive association between longer-term
   parental migration and children's enrolment, whereas the long-term
   migration of siblings sending remittances and the mid-term migration of
   other household members (not parents or siblings) are both significantly
   negatively associated with children's enrolment. The findings highlight
   the importance of considering differences between children left behind.

Title = {An agronomic, economic and behavioral analysis of N application to
   cotton and wheat in post-Soviet Uzbekistan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {104},
Number = {5},
Pages = {411-418},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cotton and winter wheat play a vital role in Uzbek agriculture: the
   first crop is a vital component of the national export revenues, while
   the latter is key in achieving independence from grain imports. Due to
   these strategic roles in the national economy, both crops are part of
   the state procurement system and, hence, are subject to strict
   regulations imposed to ensure budget revenues and self-sufficiency.
   However, many factors cause the divergence of crop yields from their
   technically maximum levels. We analyzed those factors, which hamper
   achieving the optimum response to fertilizer applications. In a stepwise
   procedure, we (i) reviewed the technical and financial optimum yield
   responses of cotton and winter wheat production to fertilizer
   applications and (ii) analyzed the changes of fertilizer-to-product
   price ratios to shed light on the agronomic and economic performance of
   cotton and wheat in the post-Soviet agricultural system of Uzbekistan.
   The analysis combined data from long-term, historical yield and
   fertilizer responses, agronomic N-fertilizer response experiments, and
   socio-economic farm surveys. Quadratic yield-response functions were
   used to derive economic and technical optimum rates of N-fertilizer
   applications. Based on the parameterized function and
   fertilizer-to-product price ratios observed for 1996-2003, we analyzed
   the difference between recommended fertilization and economic optimum
   application rates. Results showed that under the state procurement
   system, Uzbek farmers may not necessarily tend to maximize the profits
   from their cotton and wheat production. The level of subsidies and the
   differential crop support by the state induce farmers to follow the
   official fertilizer recommendations to ensure that they fulfill the
   production targets even if it implies higher production costs. The
   present gaps between the officially recorded yields and those
   technically achievable given the agro-ecological conditions in
   Uzbekistan cannot be narrowed by only improving N-fertilizer management.
   It would require additional efforts to improve cotton and wheat yields.

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Since the independence of Kyrgyzstan in 1991 and the subsequent
   dissolution of the collective/state farm system, the drinking water
   supply system in rural communities has been deteriorating much faster
   than in urban areas. This paper demonstrates the actual problems of the
   drinking water supply system in Kara-Suu, a small village in the Naryn
   Oblast. Much of the water supply infrastructure is out of operation and
   many villagers are forced to set up private solutions. Due to the
   poverty of the villagers, the local administration is unable to maintain
   the infrastructure and to provide a reliable water supply. This in turn
   causes their unwillingness to pay the water fee. Nevertheless, an
   increased responsibility of all stakeholders to manage the local water
   supply system is crucial. It is necessary to raise the awareness of all
   stakeholders, to animate them for more private dedication, and to reduce
   mistrust and corruption.},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning of English as a spoken language in English as a
   Foreign Language (EFL) still remains a major concern in Asian context as
   evident from recent studies. The situation is similar in Central Asian
   classrooms where it received little attention. Specifically, this study
   investigates a classroom in a local public school in Kazakhstan through
   the lens of a teacher and the students during speaking activities. A
   case study qualitative approach was employed using interviews, classroom
   observations, and document analysis as data collection methods. In
   total, 21 individual interviews and 30 hours of classroom observations
   were conducted and recorded. Analyses and interpretations of data show
   that firstly the speaking activities lack in negotiation of meaning as
   they are predominantly aimed at predetermined monological
   performance-based speech. Secondly, out-of-school learning was prevalent
   among the majority of students at private learning centres. Also,
   self-learning at home was practiced by male students via interacting
   with foreign players in online video games and by female students via
   watching English movies. Thirdly, classroom interactions were
   accountable in facilitating and inhibiting the practice of speaking.
   Finally, there was a mismatch between the perceptions of the teacher and
   the students on the challenges of the speaking practice. The teacher
   indicated insufficient teaching hours and students' limited background
   knowledge, while the students emphasised the teacher's unwillingness to
   use English as a language of instruction and to practice impromptu
   speech in class. In summary, the findings highlight some of the
   apprehensions faced by the teacher and the students which reveals the
   current English speaking practice in Kazakhstani classroom.},

Abstract = {Popular perceptions that the provision of income transfers to poor
   households creates work disincentives prevail. Existing evidence is
   mixed and depends on the country, the type of transfer, and the
   population group analyzed. This paper empirically estimates potential
   work disincentives of a means-tested social transfer for adults with
   different household positions. Using data from the Kyrgyz Integrated
   Household Survey 2012, the analysis compares labor market outcomes for
   household heads and spouses using quasiexperimental methods to assess
   transfer effects on labor supply. Overall, beneficiaries have on average
   higher labor market participation rates, but results differ by household
   position and socioeconomic context. Household heads in beneficiary
   households are less likely to be economically active than similar
   nonbeneficiaries. Yet, spouses are more likely to be economically
   active. Moreover, outcomes depend on whether the household is located in
   the south or the north of the country.},

Abstract = {The disintegration of the Soviet Union had profound economic and social
   effects on many of the newly independent transition economics. Nowhere
   was this more so than in the fisheries sector - with one of the biggest
   production shortfalls occurring in Kyrgyzstan, following the collapse of
   lake capture and pond-culture production. In 2005, aggregate landings
   were just 48 tonnes - barely 3 per cent of the catch level recorded in
   1989. This article has two objectives. First it analyses the extent to
   which the dissolution of the Soviet Union can explain the collapse of
   the fisheries sector in Kyrgyzstan. Second, in the light of these
   findings, it considers what practical steps, if any, might be taken to
   revitalize the sector. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Year = {2020},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {172-183},
Abstract = {This study explores the roles of female business owners and managers in
   a transitioning post-socialist economy. It draws on three case studies
   of media firms founded in the early 2000 s and 2010 s in Kyrgyzstan by
   women. Kyrgyzstan is a curious context for management-related gender
   issues since women are highly literate and highly economically active.
   Yet, female media business leaders are still uncommon. The women that
   belong to the first generation of urban business owners seek
   legitimation. It is particularly acute for the businesswomen that are
   engaged in cultural production such as media since they are rare birds
   compared to their female counterparts doing trade and commerce. Kyrgyz
   female business owners engage in a sophisticated game of being a
   commercially successful manager, and at the same time, artfully
   downplaying one's career achievements in front of the social circles.
   This paper explores women's roles through their education, family and
   marital status, and class awareness.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the study of the prospects for preserving the
   biosystems of the regions through the development of ecological tourism
   in the Republic of Tajikistan is explained by the importance of
   preserving the main resource of ecological tourism -the natural
   environment or its individual components, harmonization of the
   ecological and economic objectives of tourism development. The purpose
   of this study is to determine the prospects for the preservation of
   regional biosystems through the development of ecological tourism in the
   Republic of Tajikistan. As the results of the study showed, the
   development of ecological tourism in Tajikistan is promoted by the
   formation of regional ecological zones covering a large area that have
   unique natural and recreational resources of interest to foreign
   tourists. But, despite the availability of opportunities and development
   prerequisites, ecological tourism in the Republic of Tajikistan is in
   its infancy. According to expert estimates, the main base for the
   formation and development of ecological tourism in the republic is the
   Tajik National Park, which is formed to protect the landscape, rare and
   endangered species of flora and fauna, nature, culture and history, as
   well as the development and rationalization of tourism. The study
   emphasized that along with the positive aspects of the preservation of
   the region's biosystem in the Tajik National Park, there are a number of
   problems that hinder the development of eco-tourism. As a result of the
   analysis of existing scientific research conducted by the polls, the
   article suggests ways to solve these problems. The article will be
   useful for regional and federal authorities, educational institutions
   that prepare students in the direction of `` tourism{''}, as well as for
   all those interested in the conservation of biosystems and the
   development of ecological tourism.},

Abstract = {Considering the increasing imbalance in the economic development of
   urbanised territories of Kazakhstan, examining the impact of
   urbanisation on the economic growth of cities to ensure their innovative
   development is necessary. This study analyses trends and problems of the
   impact of urbanisation on urban development on the example of
   Kazakhstan. The article focuses on urban development and related
   processes that will open new opportunities for Kazakhstan to accelerate
   economic growth and improve living standards. The works of local
   researchers do not show the relationship between the levels of urban and
   economic development in different regions of the country and the impact
   of urbanisation on this process. To supplement previous studies, we used
   statistical and comparative analysis methods. Moreover, we compared the
   current state of urban development in Kazakhstan with the situation in
   other countries. The obtained empirical estimates confirm the
   correlation between the level of urbanisation of a country and its
   economic growth. Without a holistic approach to urban management, it is
   difficult to establish the directions, principles and development
   strategies for Kazakhstan's cities and megacities to follow. Thus, we
   identified the main directions for economic growth of urbanised
   territories of Kazakhstan: proper control and management of
   urbanisation, flexible management, development of appropriate policies
   for different regions of the country, use of best practices in
   developing urban strategies. We recommend considering the analysis of
   urban management in the broader context, and not only as a task of
   implementing regional economic growth. For that purpose, it is necessary
   to create an integrated multi-level management system that provides
   feedback and preventive management, classifying the consequences of
   urban policy in the regions and the effects of achieving the country's
   strategic development goals. Therefore, the Kazakh government should at
   least review its functions and responsibilities and look for solutions
   to achieve a tangible synergistic effect.},

Abstract = {The study purpose is to analyze the principles of administrative
   procedure and proceedings established in the Administrative Procedural
   Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as well as to identify
   recommendations for their improvement in legislation and in law
   enforcement practice. The concept and principles of administrative
   procedure and proceedings are analyzed, and deficiencies in the legal
   regulation of administrative procedure and proceedings principles are
   revealed. The study proceeds from the assumption that the existing set
   of principles of administrative procedure in the Republic of Kazakhstan,
   set out in the new Administrative Procedure and Processual Code of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan, limit the possibilities for protecting the
   rights of citizens in the administrative and procedural order. Being
   limited to the existing set, they significantly narrow the possibilities
   for improving administrative and legal norms in the future. Based on the
   review of specialized foreign legislative regulation in the field of
   administrative procedure, the study gives grounds to say that when
   developing a new act, the Kazakh legislator did not use positive foreign
   experience. The experience of Kazakhstan can be used in other countries
   that are faced with the need to reform or develop administrative
   procedural regulations.},

Title = {House price index (HPI) and Covid-19 pandemic shocks: evidence from

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-125},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate asymmetric pricing behaviour and impact
   of coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic shocks on house price index (HPI) of
   Turkey and Kazakhstan.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Monthly HPIs and consumer price index (CPI) data ranges from 2010M1 to
   2020M5 are used. This study uses a nonlinear autoregressive distributed
   lag model for empirical analysis.
   Findings
   The findings of this study reveal that the Covid-19 pandemic exerted
   both long-run and short-run asymmetric relationship on HPI of Turkey
   while in Kazakhstan, the long-run impact of Covid-19 pandemic shock is
   symmetrical long-run positive effect is similar in both HPI markets.
   Research limitations/implications
   The main limitations of this study are the study scope and data set due
   to data constraint. Several other macroeconomic variables may affect
   housing prices; however, variables used in this study satisfy the focus
   of this study in the presence of data constraint. HPI and CPI variables
   were made available on monthly basis for a considerably longer period
   which guaranteed the ranges of data set used in this study.
   Practical implications
   Despite the limitation, this study provides necessary information for
   authorities and prospective investors in HPI to make a sound investment
   decision.
   Originality/value
   This is the first study that rigorously and simultaneously examines the
   pricing behaviour of Turkey and Kazakhstan HPIs in relation to the
   Covid-19 pandemic shocks at the regional level. HPI of Kazakhstan is
   recognized in the global real estate transparency index but the study is
   rare. The study contributes to regional studies on housing price by
   bridging this gap in the real estate literature.},

Abstract = {Repatriation remains an unsolved problem of Polish migration policy. To
   date, it has taken place on a small scale, mostly outside of the state's
   repatriation system. Thousands of people with a promised repatriation
   visa are still waiting to be repatriated. The majority of the
   repatriates come from Kazakhstan, home to the largest population of
   descendants of Poles in the Asian part of the former USSR. They come to
   Poland not only for sentimental reasons, but also in search of better
   living conditions. However, repatriates-in particular older
   ones-experience a number of problems with adaptation in Poland,
   dominated by financial and housing-related issues. A further source of
   difficulties for repatriates, alongside their spatial dispersion,
   insufficient linguistic and cultural competencies, and identity
   problems, is finding a place on and adapting to the Polish labor market.
   Despite their difficult situation and special needs, the repatriates in
   Poland are not sufficiently supported due to the inefficiency of
   administration and non-governmental institutions dealing with the task
   of repatriates' integration. This results in the anguish of
   repatriation.},

   China-Kazakhstan cooperation and identifies major factors that have
   facilitated the advancement of close links between them. It explains
   China's role in Kazakhstan's multi-vectored foreign policy and
   demonstrates major milestones in the expansion of bilateral political
   and economic ties. It also addresses the current developments of
   China-Kazakhstan cooperation, particularly as related to the
   implementation of the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) initiative. In
   conclusion, the article argues that the China-Kazakhstan cooperation may
   promote the implementation of the SREB initiative, while also
   contributing to the consolidation of authoritarian regimes in the wider

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze of existing concepts of female
   entrepreneurship, evaluation of women's entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan
   and development of recommendations for its development in the country.
   This paper begins by reviewing research on female entrepreneurship. In
   this research, authors proposed the methodological tools based on
   systematic approach using economic and statistic methods and 5Ms
   concept. Analysis algorithm consists of four stages: evaluation of women
   entrepreneurship scale and business directions, analysis of employment
   in women's enterprises and business environment in Kazakhstan. The main
   limitation of this study was the lack of some gender-related indicators
   on the development of entrepreneurship. Further, the obtained results
   showed strong and weak points of female entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan.
   According to the results, there has observed increase in contribution of
   women in social-economic development of the republic, women's
   entrepreneurial activity is increasing, and the number of enterprises
   headed by them is growing. However, the growth of female
   entrepreneurship occurs while maintaining their insignificance in terms
   of turnover and number of employees. There is a pronounced industry
   specificity of female entrepreneurship: the service sector. In
   accordance with this, there were identified priority areas and there
   were developed recommendations for the development of female
   entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {789-811},

Abstract = {Initially taken as a template for farm restructuring after the demise of
   collective agriculture, the `Western family farm model' has taken root
   in the former Soviet countries only belatedly and incompletely. We
   examine dairy structures in Russia and Kazakhstan and analyse the
   drivers of recent herd growth. We are specifically interested in the
   role of farm management and organisation, vertical integration, and the
   role of policy. Regression analysis based on a sample of 180 randomly
   selected commercial dairy farms, using an innovative simultaneous
   equation framework, shows that better herd management and access to milk
   marketing contracts were more effective in stimulating herd growth than
   current subsidy payments. We do not find evidence that milking plants
   belonging to corporate entities or even supra-regional agroholdings grow
   more substantially than medium-sized individual farms. Twenty-five years
   after the end of central planning, structural change among commercial
   dairy farms in Russia and Kazakhstan appears similar in many ways to the
   patterns observed in the West more recently: smaller farms catch up in
   terms of herd growth and classical family-run operations coexist with or
   even emulate vertically integrated agribusinesses based on hired labour.
   In moving toward this `new normal' of farming structures, commercial
   dairy farms in Russia may even be a few steps ahead of their Western
   counterparts. At the same time, the still sizeable but stagnating group
   of subsistence producers in rural households finds no equivalent in the
   West.},

Abstract = {The paper examines labour relations in Kazakhstan's oil and gas TNCs,
   contributing to recent debates on the Global Union Federations' (GUFs)
   and national unions' roles in building a global system of industrial
   relations. These debates suggest a need for GUFs to involve national
   unions in organisation within and dialogue with TNCs but the GUF judged
   them insufficiently capable of this and they therefore had only limited
   involvement in GUF-led activities. Analysts arguing that a `global
   system of industrial relations' is emerging must take account of such
   issues deriving from trade unionism's global heterogeneity. (C) 2015 The

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {This article looks at the relatively understudied phenomenon of
   short-term international mobility of faculty from the critical
   internationalization perspective. It uses data from interviews with
   academics from Kazakhstan, who participated in short-term professional
   development trips abroad to understand who benefits and who loses as a
   result of short-term faculty mobility and how the short-term
   international mobility may contribute to the process of reproduction of
   the existing social structures and inequality. Critical
   internationalization perspective in general, as well as mobility
   paradigm more specifically, helps to reveal some important insights
   about short-term international mobility from a non-Western country to
   predominantly Western institutions. The main conclusion from the study
   is that host university's engagement in hosting mobile faculty coming on
   short visits seems to be driven predominantly by the neoliberal
   profit-seeking motives rather than by a more humanistic desire to serve
   the larger global society by sharing its expertise or to engage in equal
   and mutually beneficial partnership relationships.},

Title = {Friendship via a bus ride: urban mobility and social life in Nur-Sultan,
   Kazakhstan},
Journal = {EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {In social networks research, geographical distance between places of
   residence partially explains patterns of friendship ties in
   semi-isolated communities like classrooms or schools. For example,
   individuals that live close to one another are more likely to be friends
   than chance alone predicts. Explaining this pattern, researchers often
   argue that distance approximates meeting opportunities: when individuals
   live nearby, they are more likely to meet, both by chance and
   deliberately. This paper discusses the effect of distance in post-Soviet
   urban space and argues that, at least in this context, shared access to
   public transit explains the structure of social relationships better
   than geographical distance. I model the pattern of friendship ties among
   a cohort of 145 high-school students considering the distances between
   residential locations and the available public transit. Results suggest
   that students that live along the same bus routes are more likely to be
   friends than those who just live close to one another. I conclude with
   the discussion on how research in the post-Soviet region can enrich the
   discussion on the association between the social and spatial.},

Abstract = {This article looks at how Kazakhstan's heavy dependence on fossil fuels
   and its political context shape national discourse on climate change.
   Based on extensive analysis of the country's strategic documents and

   fossil fuels, the government is keen to promote sustainable development
   to attract international investments and advance its image as a `strong
   state' for the domestic audience, and as a progressive and reliable
   partner for the international audience. Whilst there is little evidence
   of `post-colonial' rhetoric appearing in Kazakhstan's official climate
   change discourse, the state's past is evident in its instrumental
   approach to environmental issues which in turn translates into

Title = {TAXATION OF COPPER AND NICKEL ORES MINING IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, CHILE,
   KAZAKHSTAN AND USA},
Journal = {PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW},

Abstract = {The subject. This article discusses the taxation of copper and nickel
   extraction in Australia, Canada, Chile, Kazakhstan and USA
   The purpose of the article is to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that
   the experience of taxation of copper and nickel extraction in Australia,
   Canada, Chile, Kazakhstan and USA may be used for modifying the mineral
   extraction tax (MET) in Russia in order to increase the share of
   resource rent collected by the government.
   The methodology of research includes legal interpretation and economic
   analysis of the tax legislation in United States, Canada, Australia,
   Chile and Kazakhstan as countries with a well-developed tax system and a
   significant size of the mining sector in overall GDP.
   The authors select the legislative acts of these countries and regions
   that determine the procedure for collecting taxes in the extraction of
   metal ores, including those containing copper and nickel, as well as in
   the production of copper and nickel. The selected legislative acts are
   analyzed to determine the essential parameters of taxation. Particular
   attention is paid to the method of calculating the tax base, taking into
   account the approach to assessing the value of the taxable object,
   permissible tax deductions and exceptions, which allows authors to test
   the hypothesis put forward by determining which part of the value of a
   mineral resource is withdrawn during taxation.
   The main results, scope of application. Mineral extraction tax is the
   main tool for collecting natural resource rent in Russia. However, the
   level of taxation of solid minerals and coal is disproportionately low
   compared to their share in the production and export of raw mate- rials.
   Thus, in 2018, the amount of MET on all minerals totaled 100.5 billion
   rubles, while the MET collected from oil and natural gas amounted to
   5,979.6 billion rubles, i.e. 60 times as much. At the same time, the
   role of solid minerals in the Russian economy is comparable to the role
   of oil and gas. The share of the main types of minerals in the exports
   of the Russian Federation in 2018 was 20.4\% compared to 56\% for oil
   and gas, i.e. the difference of less than three times. The contribution
   of the industries related to the extraction of minerals and production
   of metals (mining of coal, ores, diamonds, metallurgy, fertilizer
   production) to the Russian GDP is about half as much as that of
   industries involved in the ex- traction and processing of oil and
   natural gas (7\% and 14\% of GDP respectively).
   In view of the above, it is important to develop a new approach to the
   taxation of solid minerals in Russia based on the world's best
   practices. In order to identify the general principles of their
   taxation, we have conducted a detailed analysis of the tax legislation
   in a number of countries with a well-developed tax system and a
   significant size of the mining sector (the United States, Canada,
   Australia, Chile and Kazakhstan). We focused on the taxation of copper
   and nickel ores mining.
   Conclusions. The analysis of the international experience of taxation of
   copper and nickel min- ing sector reveals the following trend: the tax
   is calculated based on the market value of the extracted minerals, which
   is linked to the price quotes for the relevant product on an organized
   metal exchange (for example, the price of pure metal on the London Metal
   Exchange). This approach can be used in the Russian tax practice in
   several ways. First, Russia can adopt the Australian model where royalty
   on a mineral resource can be levied at the time of sale of the useful
   component irrespective of the processing stage (ore, concentrate or
   metal). The second potential model is based on the actual sale price of
   the product (provided it is sold in an arm's length transaction) after
   deducting the costs of processing (i.e., smelting, enrichment etc.,
   depending on the stage of processing) to arrive at the market value of
   the ore at the ``mine mouth{''}. The third is the Canadian model which
   is similar to the second one, but with the extraction costs also
   deducted from the sale price.},

Abstract = {This article offers a critical examination of various scholarly works
   that attempt to study political cultures of Russia and Kazakhstan in
   order to explain the ways in which participatory trends are taking
   place. The existing literature on political cultures of these two
   countries is impressionistic and somehow contradictory. Reviewing recent
   insights into the new types of political participation both offline and
   online, I argue that Almond and Verba's (1963) `civic culture' lacks
   contestation, a fourth form of political culture. Contestation in the
   forms of various protests, central to less open and more autocratic
   societies such as Russia and Kazakhstan, have strengthened in the
   emerging era of Web 3.0 and globalisation. Drawing from different
   surveys and recent political events, the present study argues that in
   order to study political cultures and participation in Russia and
   Kazakhstan, one needs to consider contestation along with the `civic
   culture' offered by Almond and Verba.},

Abstract = {In the context of rapid technological changes and modernization of
   society, the issue of ensuring adequacy of content in secondary
   education based on the use of advanced information technologies (ICT) is
   being updated. The necessity of an appropriate level of primary
   intellectual activity development in a person in terms of the current
   trends in society has been determined. In this regard, the goal of the
   article is to argue advantages of using software products in geometry
   lessons in the secondary education system of the Republic of Kazakhstan
   (RK). By the method of expert assessments, criteria for effectiveness of
   using ICT in geometry lessons have been developed to form applied
   geometric competencies in students. Functional advantages of certain
   software product types in the process of teaching geometry in secondary
   education have been substantiated. A set of practical tasks with the use
   of ICT for the academic discipline of geometry has been developed. Based
   on a pedagogical experiment, the effectiveness of using such ICTs in
   geometry lessons as Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel and AutoCAD
   ensuring applied orientation of the academic discipline has been
   substantiated and proved. The main problems of introducing ICT in the
   educational process in the current context have been identified. A set
   of practical measures has been presented that would contribute to
   effective and extensive ICT absorption in the process of teaching
   geometry in secondary education. The presented scientific research
   findings will contribute to implementation of the advanced education
   concept and its computerization under the conditions of information
   society development.},

Abstract = {Oil economies in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) region, with geographical
   proximity to each other, are usually impacted by some common risk
   factors, which make their country risks closely correlated. This paper
   focuses on correlation between country risks and investigates the
   spillovers of country risk returns (CRR). Taking Russia and Kazakhstan
   for example, firstly, this paper identifies the structural breaks in CRR
   series, using iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm.
   Secondly, on the assumption that there may be similarity in structural
   breaks of CRR series of the two countries, Vector Autoregression (VAR)
   process and Granger causality test are used to identify whether there
   are mean spillovers of CRR series. Finally, the volatility spillovers
   are captured by using multivariate conditional volatility models in the
   framework of the BEKK models. Empirical results show that (1) there are
   significant unidirectional mean spillovers from Russia to Kazakhstan;
   (2) there are asymmetric bidirectional volatility spillovers between
   Russia and Kazakhstan; and volatility spillover effects from Russia to
   Kazakhstan are stronger.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the sources of business cycle fluctuations in
   Kazakhstan and the relevance of various frictions in the economy using a
   medium-scale DSGE model with imperfect exchange rate pass-through. We
   estimate the model via Bayesian methods and present estimates of
   structural parameters of the model and highlight the role of various
   shocks in explaining the actual dynamics of observed variables. In the
   absence of quality and deseasonalized data, we show that the DSGE model
   with time-varying markups possesses a reasonable level of accuracy as
   the one-sided Kalman filter predictions match the dynamics of the
   observable variables. Posterior estimates of the model show that the
   long-run growth rate of output is 4.5\% per annum and the exchange rate
   pass-through to domestic prices is between 21\% and 35\% within a
   quarter. We also find that risk premium shocks have played an important
   role in determining the inflation rate, the interest rate and the real
   exchange rate in the economy since 2015.},

Abstract = {Children's tourism is one of the widespread types of tourism and
   performs educational, pedagogic, sanitary and other socially significant
   functions. It is one of the most steady sectors of the tourist services
   market. The most developed and oldest segments of children's tourism in
   Kazakhstan are health-improvement and cultural-educational tourism,
   educational programs are consistently in demand. The article is devoted
   to the development of children's and youth tourism in the modem social
   space of Kazakhstan. The article analyzes how children's and youth
   tourism is organized in the regions of Kazakhstan, its structure and
   quantitative parameters. The authors note that both the number of
   health-improving institutions for children and the consumer structure of
   children's and youth recreation have changed: the number of children
   having a vacation in urban school camps with a day stay, specialized and
   spa-type camps is gradually increasing. The problem of fonning a system
   of management for children's and youth tourism lies in the large number
   of activities with different subordination. The article analyzes the
   situation with camps in Kazakhstan on the basis of data from the years
   2016-2019. We have highlighted the prospects of the regions to develop
   children's and youth tourism and the main directions of its improvement.
   Thereto the market of children's and youth tourism was studied, the
   types of recreation that are in the greatest demand were identified. We
   evaluated the opportunities to develop children's sightseeing tours in
   the regions and cities of the Republic of Kazakhstan. To study the needs
   of children, an opinion poll was held among parents via Google Forms.
   The polling consisted of 5 questions to which 114 results were received
   from respondents. In Kazakhstan children's and youth tourism have a
   different level of development The formation and development of
   children's tourism depends on many factors: high-quality personnel, a
   favourable natural environment and the location of historical and
   cultural heritage, financing, etc. It is understood that the economic
   growth in the field of children's tourism in Kazakhstan is kept back by
   insufficient information transparency, focus on the provision of tourism
   services, which, in its turn, contradicts the emerging opportunities of
   communication innovations that have significantly changed the conditions
   and opportunities to implement processes of interaction between people
   and elements of socioeconomic systems, the high level of inequality of
   the population's income requiring the diversification of the tourist
   product.},

Abstract = {Extended stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and
   technology model incorporating ridge regression was used to analyze the
   driving mechanism of energy-related CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan during
   1992-2014. The research period was divided into two stages based on GDP
   of Kazakhstan in 1991 (85.70x10(9) dollars), the first stage
   (1992-2002), GDP<85.70x10(9) dollars, the stage of economic recovery;
   the second stage (2003-2014), GDP>85.70x10(9) dollars, the stable

   to promote the growth of the CO2 emissions during 1992-2014 in
   Kazakhstan. (2) Economic growth and industrialization played more
   positive effect on the increase of the CO2 emissions in the stable
   economic development stage (2003-2014) than those in the stage of
   economic recovery (1992-2002). The proportion of the tertiary industry,
   the trade openness, and foreign direct investment were transformed from
   negative factors into positive factors in the stable economic
   development stage (2003-2014). (3) Due to the over-urbanization of
   Kazakhstan before the independence, the level of urbanization continued
   to decline, urbanization was the first factor to curb CO2 emissions
   during 1992-2014. Finally, some policy recommendations are put forward
   to reduce energy-related carbon emissions.},

Title = {Causes of energy poverty in a cold and resource-rich country: evidence
   from Kazakhstan},
Journal = {LOCAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {178-197},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan is an upper-middle-income country and one of the coldest
   countries in the world with rich energy resources and energy prices
   considerably lower than in developed countries. This paper presents the
   first comprehensive overview of household fuel use in Kazakhstan and
   assesses the causes and extent of energy poverty using the Households
   Living Conditions Survey dataset of 12,000 households. The results show
   that there is an overwhelming reliance on coal in Kazakhstan: 40\% of
   all surveyed households use coal for heating, cooking and other needs.
   In general, liquefied petroleum gas is mainly used for cooking, coal and
   firewood for heating, while electricity is rarely used for heating.
   Energy poverty was less prevalent in oil and gas rich regions, due to
   low gas prices and higher income levels in those regions, while
   households located in the North Kazakhstan, Central and East Kazakhstan
   mainly suffer from lack of cleaner fuel options, income poverty, longer
   and colder winters and consequently energy affordability. Despite low
   energy prices in Kazakhstan, the results demonstrate that 28\% of
   surveyed households spend more than 10\% of their income on energy. Gas
   and district heating infrastructure coverage and income inequality
   across its regions contributed the most to energy poverty in Kazakhstan.
   Energy prices are regulated and indirectly subsidised. Removing energy
   subsidies alone may worsen energy affordability of households. Offering
   direct subsidies to cover part of the energy expenditures may not fully
   solve the problem, but subsidies, interventions for efficient
   technologies and fuels, dwelling energy-efficiency improvements are
   necessary.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the under-researched issue of migrant domestic work
   in post-Soviet space. There is an emerging trend of increase in the
   female share of migrants coming to Russia and Kazakhstan from Central
   Asia republics. The growing demand for domestic work could be an
   explanation of the feminization of migration in the region. Using the
   data of the research project conducted in 2013 in Russia and Kazakhstan,
   this paper investigates conditions of employment of female migrants in
   the domestic sector. We find that domestic sector work in the
   post-Soviet space is rather prestigious and well-paid, while at the same
   time, highly informal relationships and employment arrangements in this
   sector seem to satisfy both employers and workers. These findings
   highlight regional peculiarities of migrant domestic sector work and are
   important to better understand the feminization of migration within
   post-Soviet space.},

   the variables. Our results confirm the existence of a long-run relation
   among the series. The empirical evidence reveals that electricity
   consumption adds in economic growth. Trade openness stimulates economic
   growth, and capital and labour promote economic growth, as well. The
   causality analysis shows that electricity consumption Granger causes
   economic growth and trade openness. We also document feedback effect
   between trade openness and economic growth. Our study provides new
   insights for policymakers to articulate a comprehensive economic, trade

Abstract = {In this article we analyze a recent development in educational reform in

   has become the main approach to educational reform, but also that the
   approach has been institutionalized by the establishment of a
   specialized organizational structure, represented by a system of
   flagship institutions at different levels of education, which were
   assigned the role of identifying, adapting, testing, and disseminating
   the best international practices. Reconsidering policy transfer at the
   organizational level as knowledge transfer, we use ideas from
   interorganizational learning theory to interpret the narrative data from
   interviews with the employees of the flagships and of the educational
   organizations, to which they disseminate best practices. In doing so, we
   attempt to explore the factors which may influence the success of

Abstract = {After the collapse of the USSR, the contours of the new state borders
   crossed the areas of settlement of ethnic groups, making the issue of
   the nature of the frontier actual. In the Russian-Kazakh sector, this
   was clearly manifested in the discrepancy between the areas of
   settlement of the Russian -speaking population and the very line of the
   state border. The challenges generated by the Kazakhiza-tion policy and
   the difficulties of post-socialist transit stimulated the outflow of the
   population from the northern regions of Kazakhstan to Russia. The
   purpose of the article is to reconstruct the migra-tion of the
   Russian-speaking population in the Russian-Kazakh border area using the
   example of the South Urals. The source database was made up of archival
   documents, information from the regional statistics committee on
   migration, and materials from interviews with Russian-speaking migrants
   from Kazakhstan. The basis of Central Asian migration to the region was
   the Russian-speaking popu-lation of the border regions of Kazakhstan
   (Russians, Tatars, Ukrainians, Germans). Two waves of migration stand
   out clearly: ``forced{''} in the 1990s., and more ``pragmatic{''} in
   2000-2019 allowed to significantly compensate for the demographic
   losses, contributed to the influx of a young and economically active
   population into the region. The main areas of their exodus were Kostanay
   and Rudny (Kostanay region). The developed practices of cross-border
   cooperation and the presence of previously established communities
   allowed the newcomers to maintain strong ties with their ``homeland{''},
   to facilitate the recruitment of new migrants. In the course of the
   study, the author iden-tified the quantitative and qualitative
   parameters of migration from Kazakhstan, and determined the role of the
   frontier in the migration processes to the South Urals.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper aims to determine and explain the main factors for power
   losses (the so-called ``leaky bucket{''} effect) in Kazakhstan and the
   reasons for inefficient energy distribution within the country. Energy
   efficiency in Kazakhstan is much lower compared to more economically
   developed countries. The differences between energy efficiency in
   various regions of Kazakhstan are also significant. This article
   explores the impact of administrative monopoly tariffs on the regional
   energy efficiency, based on a national study conducted in Kazakhstan in
   2017. The purpose of the study was to identify the administrative
   barriers and their impact on the sustainability of enterprise
   development. What hinders the distribution of energy resources among
   different regions is artificial barriers in the energy market and the
   administrative tariff monopoly for electric power. This leads to the
   inefficient distribution of resources throughout the country. In
   addition, it is difficult to leverage low distribution efficiency in the
   absence of a market. The authors attempt to prove that the magnitude of
   administrative barriers directly affects the efficiency and
   competitiveness of business, as well as the final prices of goods and
   services for the end consumer.},

Abstract = {Religious activity is a very sensitive area of government regulation in
   Kazakhstan. After some post-soviet years of liberalization, the
   government has decided to return to soviet-style relations with a large
   amount of attention on the control and supervision of religious areas.
   The Law `On Religious Activity and Religious Associations' adopted in
   2011 was the result of such a decision. This article analyses the legal
   framework for religious activity, the model of relations between state
   and religious associations in modern Kazakhstan, the public attitude
   towards regulation in the religious field, the legal and social
   consequences of the adoption of current law, as well as the problems of
   its implementation and the government's administration of religious
   activity in Kazakhstan. The author reaches the conclusion that more
   liberal legislation and law-enforcement practice is unlikely without
   changes in the political system, the public attitude towards religion
   and views on secularity.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the emerging progressive use of ornamental art
   in the landscape architecture of Kazakhstan and determined the influence
   of symbolism on the quality of new urban environments. The study
   analysed the existing recreational facilities in Kazakhstan in order to
   establish their symbolic meaning, the level of utilisation of symbolic
   ornaments, and the socio-economic factors that influence the design
   structure of landscape elements. The results revealed that symbolic
   meanings of the ornaments stem from historic, legal and cultural
   traditions of different ethnic groups in Kazakhstan. Therefore, the form
   depends on not only the topography of the area, but also the traditional
   symbolism and numerology. This study categorised the studied places
   according to their size: large gardens, small squares and small
   landscape forms. Taking into account the natural and climatic features
   of Kazakhstan, small landscape forms acquire the quality of arid zone
   gardens. However, lack of identity and consistency appears to be a major
   problem in design of larger scale landscapes. This article posits that
   coordination between socio-economic and historical -cultural factors
   will open new creative opportunities for the development of an original
   landscape architecture in Kazakhstan, yet balance between environmental
   construction and contextually meaningful urban planning will still be
   needed.},

Title = {The existence of a stable money multiplier in the small open economy of
   Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1211-1223},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine whether a long-run
   stable money multiplier exists in Kazakhstan. It also investigates
   whether different episodes of currency shocks, including the financial
   crisis and recession of 2008-2010, have affected the working of the
   money multiplier in Kazakhstan.
   Design/methodology/approach The long-run multiplier is tested employing
   three cointegration tests: Engle-Granger (1987), Phillips-Ouliaris
   (1990) and Johansen and Juselius (1990).
   Findings The results of cointegration and coefficient restrictions tests
   are consistent with the money multiplier when broad money (M2 and M3) is
   used rather than when narrow money (M1) is used. The relationship
   between broad money and monetary base is structurally stable when
   examined on the basis of a dynamic (an error-correction) model. However,
   the M2 multiplier performs better than the M3 multiplier.
   Research limitations/implications This paper is restricted to testing a
   mechanistic version of the money multiplier and its stability using both
   narrow (M1) and broad money (M2 and M3) supplies. Thus, the paper
   focusses on the money view of the multiplier rather than the credit view
   of the multiplier.
   Practical implications One implication that emerges from the findings of
   this paper is that the National Bank of Kazakhstan can control M2 by
   controlling the monetary base, and hence the latter can serve as an
   indicator for monetary policy.
   Social implications The validity of the money multiplier implies that
   monetary policy can be conducted to control the money supply and the
   provision of bank credit to private sector to stabilize economic
   activity, thereby leading towards social stability in the economy as
   well.
   Originality/value In addition to offering a coherent survey of the
   literature on the standard money multiplier, this paper is a first
   attempt to find a stable money multiplier for Kazakhstan.},

   within an intense competition for resources, information, and influence
   between the United States, the Soviet Union, and two Chinese regimes,
   the Russians at the heart of this article reveal how the Cold War was a
   truly global conflict which was intimately experienced by ordinary
   peoples and often times in the places most far removed. This episode is
   furthermore a reminder that even if the Cold War did produce stability
   at the macro-level, the outcomes of the strategic rivalry and
   competition between the Soviet Union and the United States were violent
   and tragic, not necessarily or exclusively for these countries but
   especially for their allies and accomplices.},

   presents the findings from a survey of Kazakhstani university students

   democracy as consisting of civil and political rights (i.e., the Western
   concept of democracy). However, also based on our survey results, our
   main argument is that, if forced to choose, they consider social
   services and economic development more important than political and
   civil rights. Another finding is that Muslims demonstrate stronger

Abstract = {Kazakhstan sits at the crossroads of Eurasia. Its foreign policy is
   heavily defined by geopolitics - the intersection of geography and
   international politics. However, there have been few studies that have

   presidential addresses, this article examines 18 presidential addresses
   by Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, in an effort to
   identify the assumptions and content of his geopolitical code. In
   particular, it focuses on four issues: the degree of emphasis Nazarbayev
   has placed on specific countries and regions, Kazakhstan's geopolitical
   situation and position, the multi-vector foreign policy and Kazakhstan's
   role in the international system, and the need for Kazakhstan to be
   integrated into the global economy.},

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},
Abstract = {This article discusses the `red yurt' campaigns in early Soviet
   Kazakhstan, in which party and state institutions sponsored mobile
   centres of Soviet culture in nomadic pastoralist communities. In
   conversation with other literature on nomadic encounters with the Soviet

   `culturedness' (kul'turnost') within nomadic `everyday life' (byt)-two
   concepts that have, so far, been discussed primarily in the Russian
   context. It argues that the campaigns were less antagonistic towards
   nomadic lifestyles and more embedded in regional discourse than has
   often been assumed, although realities on the ground complicated
   idealistic plans.},

   post-Soviet Tajikistan},
Journal = {DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the sparse literature about the impact of
   temporary migration on fertility in sending regions. It examines the
   case of male labour migration from post-Soviet Tajikistan, a significant
   and relatively recent phenomenon. Fertility and migration models are
   solved simultaneously to account for cross-process correlation. There is
   clear evidence for a short-term disruptive effect of spousal separation,
   but it is too early to assess the implications for completed fertility.
   While there is no evidence for unobserved selectivity at the couple
   level, there is a significant positive covariance between the migration
   and fertility processes at the community level. Rather than reflecting
   the contextual influence of community migration patterns on fertility,
   this positive covariance may reflect selectivity: given that labour
   migration in Tajikistan is prompted by economic need, poorer communities
   - in which women tend to have higher than average fertility - may also
   be expected to display an above average prevalence of labour migration.},

Abstract = {Central Asian countries attract investment in transport infrastructure
   to rebuild the Silk Road paths and enjoy economic benefits from the
   participation in international trade. The Kazakhstani government
   approached the Russian and Chinese governments intending to join the
   Western Europe-Western China (WE-WC) initiative to boost the country's
   regional development. The paper aims to assess how the WE-WC transport
   corridor affected the economic potential of linking cities and regions
   starting from the quality of transport infrastructure and leading to
   their export potential. The study's findings showed that the Kazakhstan
   section of the WE-WC corridor was at an early stage of transformation
   from a transport into an economic corridor. While the Russia-Uzbekistan
   section continues to serve mainly a transit function and operate at the
   level of transport infrastructure, the China-Kyrgyzstan section has
   started evolving from the level of multimode transport corridor to the
   level of logistics corridor. The economic sustainability of the WE-WC
   linking mining and agricultural regions of Kazakhstan still comes into
   question and depends on the government's further region-specific policy
   actions.},

   exaggerated their originality, impact, and importance. Following
   introductory discussions of the recurrent motifs and claims found in
   `Jadidocentric' scholarship, the essay considers five issues in
   particular: (1) the academic bias through which scholars have taken the
   Jadids' critique as reliably descriptive rather than polemical; (2) the
   neglect of earlier Central Asian manifestations of critiques similar to
   the Jadids'; (3) the analytical drawbacks of the notion of `modernity'
   as used to characterize the Jadids; (4) neglect or denial of the
   religious character of the Jadids' program; and (5) inattention to the
   wider intellectual history of Central Asia before and during the era of
   the Jadids.},

   Ground-based monitoring results from the LUCA project},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {429},
Number = {B},
Pages = {86-99},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {As larger parts of the former Aral Sea have been desiccated, more (and
   harmful) dust storms (DS) and dust deposition (DD) occur more frequently
   in the surrounding area. Due to the prevalent wind directions, the
   southern Aral Sea region is affected stronger by these DS and DD as
   other areas around the former Aral Sea. The densely populated study area
   belongs to the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan and the autonomous
   oblast (district) Khorezm within the Republic of Uzbekistan. For
   improving the knowledge about the spatial and temporal distribution of
   DD in the study region, seven sampling stations of the Uzbek
   meteorological survey have been equipped with passive deposition
   samplers between 2003 and 2012. The monthly amount of dust, the grain
   sizes, the mineralogical and chemical composition were determined and in
   several cases individual dust storm events were analyzed as well.
   Although the monthly average dust deposition was relatively low (598.4
   kg/ha), the peak deposition during dust storms was up to 160 times
   higher than this average. While the seasonal DD rate was increasing from
   spring to fall, the health related threshold excess showed the highest
   intensity during spring and summer. At most stations the grain size
   composition of the dust samples (85-90\% are silt and clay dominated)
   was very similar to the composition of the near surface soils. The
   stations Muynak and Jaslyk, representing dust originating from the Aral
   Kum, are characterized by dust rich in HCO3, SO4 and Ca. Among the trace
   elements, heavy metals were analyzed because of their health-affecting
   potential. The total heavy metal concentrations in the southern Aral Sea
   region are relatively low compared to the results from other parts of
   Uzbekistan. Zinc showed the greatest dominance close to the Aral Kum,
   while chromium on the other hand increased its percentage with a growing
   distance to the former Aral Sea. The spatial and temporal dynamics of
   the dust deposition as well as the distribution of heavy metals indicate
   a further need for ground based research for the improvement of the
   database and a better understanding of the dust mobilization, transport
   and deposition mechanisms in the Aral Kum and the southern Aral Sea
   region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

   geoeconomic contestation is a tool for increasing importance and

   Kazakhstan's current multilateral approach to foreign affairs utilizes
   geoeconomic contestation in a unique way that benefits national

   study looks at the great power contestation in Kazakhstan to show the
   effect of geoeconomic contestation on pivot countries, where pivot
   countries create a relationship that is mutually beneficial rather than
   clientelist, dependent or exploitative. This study shows evidence
   supporting research on great power politics that suggests that
   geostrategic pivots have the agency and power to push national interests

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The article examines the ethnographic and art-history aspects of the
   reflection of the artistic image of the ancient Turkic goddess Umay in
   the modern visual culture of Kazakhstan. The image of this goddess is
   one of the most widespread in the work of modern Kazakhstani artists,
   who refer to the symbolism of Tengrian culture in their works. Each of
   the masters, due to their individual worldview and creative style,
   interprets it in their own way, thereby enriching the modern visual
   culture of independent Kazakhstan. It is also necessary to mention that
   the embodiment of symbols and artistic images of the ancient Turkic
   Tengrian culture by contemporary artists of Kazakhstan in the visual
   arts reflects the desire to preserve and rethink the national identity
   in the context of globalisation processes. The study is an attempt at
   art criticism analysis based on the application of the hermeneutic
   methodology of numerous author's interpretations of the artistic image
   of the goddess in the fine arts of modern Kazakhstan. The study of the
   problem of finding and embodying artistic images of the Goddess Umay,
   reflecting the sacred and mythological aspects of the Tengrian
   worldview, traditional for the nomadic peoples of the Great Steppe, in
   the visual culture of modern Kazakhstan, has an important theoretical
   and educational and methodological value. The conclusions of this study
   can be used and continued not only in the historical and theoretical
   works of art historians, cultural experts but also in research and
   educational-methodical works, when creating courses on the history and
   theory of fine and applied arts, scientific projects of the teaching
   staff, students, undergraduates and doctoral students, as well as in the

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the article the issues of establishing and functioning of the zones
   with special economic activity conditions are addressed and their impact
   on the environment in Russia and Kazakhstan is assessed. The relevance
   of the subject of the research is determined, on the one hand, by a
   qualitative change in the role of the environmental issues in the system
   of values of population of the post-soviet countries and, on the other
   hand, by cumulative increase of the negative impact due to the
   irrational environmental management. Information about the types of
   special status zones established in these countries is systematized. The
   key characteristics of these institutional entities are compared, which
   includes goals and specifics of their development, implemented
   organizational mechanisms, measures for support of business activities,
   offered tax incentives and preferences. The authors demonstrate that the
   adopted accelerated economic growth strategy within the framework of
   zones with special status is implemented disregarding the environmental
   effects of their development, which poses serious threats to
   self-preservation of the society and environment. Common and
   country-specific risks of functioning of the zones with special economic
   activity conditions are justified. Factors contributing to inadequate
   assessment of the negative impact on the environment of industries,
   created in SEZ were revealed. It is emphasized that the current legal
   and regulatory framework of these zones in Russia and Kazakhstan is
   aimed not at the prevention of environmental threats but at the easing
   of requirements for entities in the field of environmental management.
   Finally, conclusion is made about the greening opportunities of
   development of the zones with special economic activity conditions, a
   necessity to enhance the environmental legislation and mutual ``best
   practices{''} adoption opportunities in this field in Russia and
   Kazakhstan. The empirical basis of the analysis is constituted by the
   results of the studies carried out within the framework of the research
   work ``Enhancement of the State Regulation Policy of Accelerated
   Clustering of the Industrial Regions{''} implemented on the grounds of
   the grant funding of the Ministry of Education and Science of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {The resolutions of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) and
   other state documents pay special attention to the development of the
   unified transport system of the Republic of Kazakhstan, modernization of
   all its elements, improving the efficiency of the transport complex,

   that the transport complex of the Republic occupies a special place in
   ensuring the implementation of the state strategy of further dynamic and
   stable development of the economy of Kazakhstan, its integration into
   the world economy. In this article discusses the issues of scientific
   and methodological basis for the development of the system of regional
   transport and logistics centers, taking into account the specifics of
   the Republic of Kazakhstan. In the context of market competition and
   globalization of the world economy, the most important factor of
   economic growth is the formation of integrated logistics systems,
   covering both individual areas of business and entire regions and
   countries. As a relatively new methodology of market orientation, which
   allows regulating regional markets of goods and services, the article
   considers the logistics approach, which provides an increase in the
   overall synergetic effect on the basis of the integration of

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between governance regime and
   large-scale irrigation system design by investigating three cases: 1)
   protective irrigation design in post-independent South India; 2) canal
   irrigation system design in Khorezm Province, Uzbekistan, as implemented
   in the USSR period, and 3) canal design by the Madras Irrigation and
   Canal Company, as part of an experiment to do canal irrigation
   development in colonial India on commercial terms in the 1850s-1860s.
   The mutual shaping of irrigation infrastructure design characteristics
   on the one hand and management requirements and conditions on the other
   has been documented primarily at lower, within-system levels of the
   irrigation systems, notably at the level of division structures. Taking
   a `social construction of technology' perspective, the paper analyses
   the relationship between technological structures and management and
   governance arrangements at irrigation system level. The paper finds
   qualitative differences in the infrastructural configuration of the
   three irrigation systems expressing and facilitating particular forms of
   governance and rule, differences that matter for management and use, and
   their effects and impacts.},

Abstract = {There is a controversial debate about what is the best public policy a
   government should adopt to achieve an affordable and stable supply of
   staple food for its citizens so to ensure food security. This paper
   contributes to the debate on the socio-economic impacts of food
   self-sufficiency policy (SSP) in three ways. First, it thoroughly
   outlines the costs and advantages of self-sufficiency policy presented
   in the literature. It argues that self-sufficiency policies are not
   neutral but have to be assessed for their distributional impacts across
   the different actors and over time, and in their context-specificity.
   Second, using the case of wheat self-sufficiency policy in Uzbekistan,
   it unpacks its effects on the different economic actors and
   institutions. Third, it reflects on the relevance of wheat
   self-sufficiency policy for food security in a context of dynamic

Title = {English as an index of neoliberal globalization: The linguistic
   landscape of Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan},
Journal = {LANGUAGE SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {92},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Examining the linguistic landscape of the new capital city of
   Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan (formerly Astana), this article demonstrates the
   sociolinguistic transformations following adoption of neoliberal
   economic policies during the post-Soviet period. The study uses
   `neoliberal governmentality' as a conceptual lens to examine how
   neoliberalism as an economic policy evolves into a form of governance
   reinforcing the logic of the market in peoples' linguistic behaviors.
   Drawing on a photographic survey of the linguistic landscape and
   ethnographic interviews, the study shows that liberalization and
   flexibilization of the linguistic market has allowed English and
   Latinized brand names in several foreign languages to occupy a
   substantial space, frequency, and prominence in the LL. English appears
   to challenge the decades old dominance of the Russian language as it
   evidently wields remarkable visibility as the most valued marketing
   tool. Glimpses of Latinized Kazakh signboards indicates a gradual
   bottom-up shift to Latinization of the Kazakh language. By situating
   language as a socially grounded practice, ethnographic analysis of
   linguistic landscape can provide valuable theoretical insights about
   different manifestations of neoliberalism, particularly showing how
   neoliberal governmentality shapes mental linguistic hierarchies,
   mobilizing peoples' subjectivities to associate language (s) with the
   quality of goods/products, their prices, bargaining strategies,
   lifestyles, and social standing. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {With the development of tourism it has been necessary modernization of
   ways on being attended by tourists. Comparatively new method of
   influencing to a customer is branding, has been the most significant
   process in terms of promotion, which identify features of exact
   territory in contribution of competitive activities for being attractive
   for tourists. The article is aimed to identify the existing and
   promising tourist brands of Western Kazakhstan. Since territorial
   branding is a key factor in the development of tourism industry, the
   authors conducted a survey among respondents from different regions of
   Kazakhstan to identify potential tourist brands, main associations, as
   well as challenges and opportunities for recreation and tourism. The
   research was carried out using the Google Forms platform and
   sociological survey. The research results prove that there are
   unofficial leading brands in the region, which are likely to become the
   region's official tourist symbols. Besides, both favorable and
   unfavorable factors for recreation demonstrate the controversial
   development of tourism industry in the research area. Creation,
   development, and promotion of a tourist brand plays an important role in
   the tourism and recreation area. This contributes to strengthening the
   tourist destination image in the tourism market.},

Abstract = {Internationalization and integration of the educational environment
   raises the issue of university lecturer development of professional
   mobility in Kazakhstan's higher education system. The aim of the study
   is to find an empirical approach to defining the factors for the
   development of lecturer professional mobility in the modern conditions
   of functioning of higher education in Kazakhstan. Using the cluster
   analysis and justification of the efficiency criterion, the researcher
   conducted a representative sample of 30 local universities. In order to
   obtain quantitative estimates of their professional mobility level, the
   researcher surveyed 1109 lecturers from a sample set of Kazakhstan
   universities. To determine the structure and factors of professional
   mobility and the role of the resource component in professional
   mobility, the researcher employed principles component analysis, which
   was carried out on the basis of the quantitative estimates obtained as a
   result of the survey. Finally, the influence of pedagogical mobility
   factors on the efficiency level of the university was studied using
   regression models made using the method of nonlinear evaluation. The
   results of the study are of a practical nature. To know the factors of
   professional mobility is fundamental for educational management as it
   determines the ratio of resource and process components that underlie
   the coordination of interests of both the employee and the university,
   as well as the strategy for the development of lecturers in
   universities. This, in turn, can significantly increase the efficiency
   of their activities, as well as ensure the success of integration into

Abstract = {Temperate grasslands have suffered disproportionally from conversion to
   cropland, degradation and fragmentation. A large proportion of the
   world's remaining near-natural grassland is situated in Kazakhstan. We
   aimed to assess current and emerging threats to steppe and semi-desert
   biodiversity in Kazakhstan and evaluate conservation research
   priorities. We conducted a horizon-scanning exercise among
   conservationists from academia and practice. We first compiled a list of
   45 potential threats. These were then ranked by the survey participants
   according to their perceived severity, the need for research on them,
   and their novelty. The highest-ranked threats were related to changes in
   land use (leading to habitat loss and deterioration), direct persecution
   of wildlife, and rapid infrastructure development due to economic and
   population growth. Research needs were identified largely in the same
   areas, and the mean scores of threat severity and research need were
   highly correlated. Novel threats comprised habitat loss by photovoltaic
   and wind power stations, climate change and changes in agriculture such
   as the introduction of biofuels. However, novelty was not correlated
   with threat severity or research priority, suggesting that the most
   severe threats are the established ones. Important goals towards more
   effective steppe and semi-desert conservation in Kazakhstan include more
   cross-sector collaboration (e.g. by involving stakeholders in
   conservation and agriculture), greater allocation of funds to
   under-staffed areas (e.g. protected area management), better
   representativeness and complementarity in the protected area system and
   enhanced data collection for wildlife monitoring and threat assessments
   (including the use of citizen-science databases).},

Title = {Exploring Resilience and Transformability of a River Basin in the Face
   of Socioeconomic and Ecological Crisis: an Example from the Amudarya
   River Basin, Central Asia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Water from the Amudarya River is a vital and strategic resource for
   semi-arid Uzbekistan because of its heavy reliance on irrigated
   agriculture. The Uzbek water management regime, however, has proven to
   be rather reluctant to adapt to changing environmental and
   socio-political conditions despite recent massive pressures caused by
   political, environmental, or donor-induced developments in the region.
   The aim of this paper is to explore reasons for the low adaptability of
   the Uzbek water sector and assess implications for the resilience of the
   Uzbek social-ecological system (SES). By analyzing past losses of
   resilience as well as first attempts at institutional change in land and
   water management, we identify drivers as well as structural factors and
   mechanisms that act as barriers for adaptation and transformation
   towards a more sustainable system. With the collapse of the Aral Sea
   fisheries and the basin-wide large scale soil salinization, the SES in
   the Amudarya River Basin has shifted to a new, less desirable regime.
   However, the high resilience of the social system is keeping it in its
   current undesirable state and further degrades its long-term resilience.
   Our analysis identifies reinforcing feedbacks caused by ecological
   dynamics, vested interests, and a patronage system that contribute to
   the resistance to change and keep the system locked in its current
   unsustainable state. These factors are rooted in the history of the SES
   in the river basin, such as the economic dependence on cotton and the
   state-centered management approach. The window of opportunity for
   significant changes of the larger scale institutional setting that might
   have been open after the breakup of the Soviet Union was or could not be
   used to achieve a transformation to more sustainable resources use.
   Measures aimed at an incremental improvement of the current situation
   are not sufficient to prevent further losses of resilience. Resilience
   and transformability of the larger scale SES (political, economic, and
   institutional settings) are needed to enable the smaller scales
   (regional and local water management) to adapt and change. However, we
   identified opportunities for change arising from the slow acceptance of
   bottom-up management institutions in the water sector and from the
   extensive restoration capacity of the ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and China's Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI) intersect and overlap in Central Asia at the heart of
   Eurasia. Whereas the literature has commonly focused on the economic
   aspects of these major regional policy initiatives, efforts to create a
   common Eurasian higher education space through these regionalisms have
   barely been studied. In response, this paper compares the development of
   Russian and Chinese led visions for Eurasian higher education
   regionalism in Central Asia and the extent to which these constructions
   overlap. The paper also sheds lights on the perspectives of Central
   Asian states by investigating how these countries are approaching these
   efforts to construct a Eurasian higher education region. The conceptual
   framework brings together higher education regionalism with overlapping
   regionalism and takes a policy-oriented methodological approach. The
   paper introduces the new term of ``points of correspondence{''} based on
   language used in both Russian and Chinese policy discourse to explain
   how constructions of a Eurasian higher education region can overlap
   without duplicating or flowing into each other. ``Points of
   correspondence{''} emphasizes neither competition nor collaboration but
   rather the ongoing pursuit to find ideas and policy tools that best fit
   one another.},

Abstract = {This paper used three participatory methods- children's drawings,
   photographs, and group interviews- along with a short questionnaire to
   explore Grade 6 pupils' experiences and perceptions of the private
   tutoring (PT) they had received in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. The
   questionnaire data suggest that 316 out of 406 (79.87\%) attended PT.
   The qualitative data from 30 pupils reveal that the participants'
   motives of having PT ranged from adult-imposed reasons (e.g. complying
   with parents' wishes by studying for an elite school place) to reasons
   associated with achieving their ideal selves by boosting their interest
   in learning and imagining themselves working/studying abroad or pursuing
   an international career. The participants acted as proactive agents by
   explaining not only the PT benefits but also its disadvantages,
   including the unethical practices of some schoolteachers, increasing
   tiredness and it being a potentially unfair advantage in a competitive
   context. This study suggested pedagogical implications and areas for
   ongoing research.},

Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan was faced with

   Kazakhstan inherited a large ethnic Russian population and a severe
   economic depression. These conditions affected other countries emerging
   from the Soviet Union, but only Belarus matched Kazakhstan's level of
   strategic cooperation with Russia. President Nursultan Nazarbaev's
   dominance of Kazakhstan's national security agenda offers a partial
   explanation for the cooperation, but we still need to ask what makes him
   different from the leaders of other post-Soviet countries that faced the
   same conditions. Kazakhstan's pattern of historical development provides
   the key to understanding the cooperation. The timing of the country's
   contact and experiences with the Russian-led empires led to a `dominant
   ally' image of Russia that continues to decide the two countries'
   relationship to the present day.},

Abstract = {The fall of the Soviet Union ushered in a process of commodification of
   science and raised new questions about the production of public goods.
   This paper examines the dramatic impact of post-Soviet changes on the
   organization and content of research on plant protection in Kazakhstan.
   It describes how a passive restructuring dismantled much of the research
   and extension infrastructure in Kazakhstan and how earlier ecological
   perspectives on pest control, often not recognized in the Western
   literature, were abandoned and replaced by short-term strategies based
   on imported technologies, basically pesticides. This study of the
   transformation of scientific research in the transition from communism
   to capitalism provides an opportunity to reflect on the public good
   characteristics of plant protection research. The analysis shows that
   the current commodification process and short-termism in plant
   protection research are incompatible with ecologically sustainable pest
   control approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The teaching of oral communication (OC) has been addressed in different
   ESL and EFL contexts, though mainly in a university setting. However, it
   has received little attention in the Central Asian context. This paper
   will provide preliminary insights into the practice of teaching English
   OC and the challenges associated with it in public schools in Kazakhstan
   (KZ), a country in Central Asia. For the pilot study reported here, data
   was collected from 18 KZ learners from 9 different schools via e-mail
   interviews. The study was guided by a theoretical model representing
   three levels of influence on OC practice: micro, meso, and macro. The
   current OC activities were found to be lacking in spontaneity, too
   teacher-centred and individual-oriented. At the micro level, emotional
   constraints were considered to have a greater impact on female students'
   oral performance, while limited linguistic repertoire affected male
   students' oral production. At the meso level, females found a lack of
   emotional support from their teachers, while males preferred to have
   out-of-class help from their friends to practise English. At the macro
   level, males were found to be more influenced by a wider sociocultural
   context than females. Firstly, the findings reveal the gap between the
   actual and preferred OC practices in KZ public schools, which can be
   further addressed by the stakeholders. Secondly, they illustrate how
   gender influences the way learners engage in OC activities. And lastly,
   they underline the importance of examining OC in relation to learners'
   self their social communities and the overarching context that shapes
   their attitude towards a language.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the theorisation of collective memory
   involved in building the international representations of a nation, and
   examines how strategic responses to the legacy of the totalitarian past
   have been deployed to shape the image of the nations' remembering agency
   via the connections with other actors within the global memory field.
   Drawing on the Bourdieusian concept of symbolic capital, the article
   develops a concept of the symbolic capital of mnemonics in order to
   uncover the role of memory in enhancing international standing and
   prestige, a crucial preoccupation for semi-peripheral states emerging on
   the global arena. While recent scholarship on traumatic memory as a
   category of social analysis underlines the role of memory in bolstering
   the collective identity of nations, the article demonstrates how
   memories of the communist past provide a platform for connections
   between nation-states through shared meta-narratives. Through an
   empirical case study that uses an ethnographic approach, participant
   observation and analysis of media accounts, the article examines how the
   official commemorative practices of Kazakhstan have served to realign
   the country's mnemonic agenda with that of the global memory of
   communism and to redeploy the symbolic capital gained through a shared
   mnemonics to reassert its legitimacy both abroad and at home.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to determine the transfer pricing
   aggressiveness index in the system of MNCs and focuses on identifying
   the significant determinants of transfer pricing aggressiveness in the
   enterprises of Kazakhstan in order to develop policies and regulations.
   During the research six variables were tested, which are the size of the
   enterprise, performance of the company, the structure of the capital,
   intangible assets, and cash flow from operating activities. It was
   expected that all these variables are positively associated with
   transfer pricing aggressiveness, however we obtained only 3 variables
   that were statistically significant which are size of the firm,
   profitability of the firm and intangibles of the firm.
   There are some limitations of the study, which are that the sample size
   is too small for this kind of research, there is no division of the
   companies for industries. Future research can be done taking into
   account these limitations.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the CO2 emissions-economic growth relationship
   in Kazakhstan for the period 1992-2013. Johansen, ARDLBT, DOLS, FMOLS,
   and CCR cointegration methods are used for robustness purpose. We start
   with the cubic functional form to rule out any misleading results that
   can be caused by misspecification. Although the estimation results
   suggest ``U{''}-shaped relationship, the turning point of income is out
   of the period. It means that the impact of economic growth on CO2 is
   monotonically increasing in the long run indicating the Environmental
   Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis does not hold for Kazakhstan. Moreover,
   we calculate that the income elasticity of CO2 is about unity. The paper
   concludes that the Kazakhstani policymakers should focus on less
   energy-intensive sectors as well as using more renewable energy in order
   to avoid higher pollution effects of economic growth. They may also set
   new policy regulations for CO2 reduction.},

Abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution precipitately spins up, including due
   to digital technologies, robotization of productions, the fissile
   introduction of cyber systems, development of the Internet of things. In
   the modern world, digital technologies play a more and more critical
   role in the development of the national economy of the countries. They
   have several advantages: simplification of access for the population and
   business to public services, acceleration of exchange of information,
   and the emergence of new opportunities for business, creation of new
   digital technologies, products. The main objective of the state program
   ``Digital Kazakhstan{''} is progressive development of a national
   digital ecosystem for economic growth, improving the competitiveness of
   the economy and improvement population quality of life. According to
   experts, only digitalization of Oil\&Gas sector will reduce
   manufacturing costs and accident rate, and increase the effectiveness of
   geological exploration, capital investments in production projects,
   decrease common threats. Digitalization of mines within the Digital Mine
   project will allow for cutting down expenses on 4\%; considering
   marginality of the industry of 29\%, the effect will be 12-26 billion
   KZT in 2025 and 23-40 billion KZT in 2018-2025.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the state and ways of development of the education
   system of Kazakhstan, taking into account international trends in the

   March 2010 faced the country with the necessity of modernizing
   significantly the education system, including continuous natural science
   education. At the same time, the transition from the ``knower{''}
   concept i.e. armed with a system of knowledge and skills, to ``a person
   prepared for life{''}, i.e. a person who is able to think and act
   actively and creatively, as well as to self-improve intellectually,
   morally and physically. In this direction, the modernization of the
   education system is a factor for a successful future.
   The implementation of the provisions of the Bologna Declaration made it
   possible to make changes to the goals, content, forms, and methods of
   teaching subjects to students in secondary school and to pedagogical
   staff in higher education institutions. Over time, this will enable the

Title = {Effect of Non-formal Experiential Education on Personal Agency of
   Adolescent Girls in Tajikistan: Findings from a Randomized Experimental
   Study},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Introduction Despite the claim of non-formal experiential education
   enhancing agency among youth, few studies offer robust evidence. Drawing
   from the capability approach, social cognitive theory, and experiential
   learning theory, we present the first experimental study in Central Asia
   testing the effect of experiential educational program on adolescent
   girls' personal agency, including self-efficacy, future orientation, and
   locus of control. Methods We ran multilevel random-intercept
   mixed-effects models using the repeated measures data collected from
   1221 school-going adolescent girls within the cluster-randomized
   experimental study conducted in 60 public schools in Tajikistan. Results
   We found significant positive effect of intervention on girls' future
   planning (OR = 2.82; 95\% CI = from 1.85 to 4.3; p < 0.001) and locus of
   control (B = - 2.55, 95\% CI = from - 3.9 to - 1.2, p < 0.001), but no
   effect on their self-efficacy. We also found significant intervention
   effect on adolescents' attitudes towards saving, financial behavior, and
   some indicators of health knowledge. Conclusions Our study contributes
   to the global youth development agenda by suggesting that, while
   non-formal experiential educational programs may have some effect on
   adolescents' psychosocial outcomes, integrated interventions involving
   all components of young person's ecosystem (i.e., family, school,
   community) might be more effective in affecting youth agency.},

Title = {The Socio-Linguistic Adaptation of Migrants: The Case of Oralman
   Students' Studying in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article examines different aspects of the oralman students'
   socio-linguistic adaptation. Scientific research has identified various
   obstacles oralmen face when studying at Universities in Kazakhstan,
   especially in the context of the English language studying process. The
   data used in this paper explores certain peculiarities of oralman
   students' adaptation to new educational environments, their attitude
   towards English, and their difficulties in advancing in foreign language
   learning. The electronic questionnaires, which included the Likert
   scale, multiple choice and open-ended questions, were offered to 600
   students, while interviews were conducted with 90 students in the last
   stage of the research. Descriptive statistics and one-way analysis of
   variance were used to analyze the data. The scientific findings
   indicated some unexpected difficulties in the oralman students'
   socio-linguistic adaptation, which decreased their motivation for
   learning the foreign language and reduced effectiveness of the teaching.
   However, certain noticeable discrepancies between the anticipated and
   real educational context were revealed. The interview and data analysis
   made it possible to uncover cultural, linguistic, social, and
   psychological problems. The scientific research suggests that the
   incorporation of some integrative effective methods and techniques into
   English classes would be useful for improvement of the oralman students'
   English language skills.},

Abstract = {The research of innovation activity of enterprises is found at the nexus
   of management, economics, public administration, psychology, sociology,
   and technical sciences. That is because the involvement of people in
   this process implies a comprehensive assessment of interdependent
   factors operating at the level of states, industries, regions,
   enterprises, social groups, and individuals. In the following paper we
   study the influence of various factors on organization and development
   of innovation activities at medium and high-tech enterprises of the
   manufacturing industry of Kazakhstan. The purpose of this study is to
   analyze the factors affecting the organization and development of
   innovation at medium and high-tech enterprises in Kazakhstan. Based on
   correlation and regression analysis we study the following factors:
   economic development; availability of human capital; quality of the
   investment environment; features of the economic structure; quality of
   human capital; innovative development of manufacturing enterprises;
   scientific potential; quality of the legal environment; availability of
   financing; state support. We conclude that econometric modeling of
   innovation at enterprises in Kazakhstan is never a simple task. The
   study reveals that labor productivity positively affects innovation and
   competitiveness of enterprises, and that a human capital turns out to be
   a more important factor of innovation activity of enterprises in
   Kazakhstan than research and development costs due to their
   inefficiency.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on a widely publicized criminal prosecution
   recently completed in the U. S. District Court in New York City. It
   features an oil broker by the name of James Giffen who is accused of
   paying bribes totaling as high as \$84 million dollars to high-ranking
   members of the government in Kazakhstan. This includes the President,
   the Prime Minister, and a former oil minister. Mainstream criminology
   tends to see these perpetrators as individual evil-doers who exploit
   opportunity structures, rational-choice purveyors of greed, or even as
   persons who experienced problems of social attachment as young people.
   To the contrary, this paper suggests that the pattern is firmly grounded
   in the geo-politics of oil in central Asia, in which governments and
   their multi-national oil companies are jockeying for lucrative oil
   reserves. In the instant case, there was circumstantial evidence that
   both the CIA, State Department, and even the Clinton White House knew
   what Mr. Giffen was doing in Kazakhstan, and looked the other way - so
   as to favor American, multi-national oil companies seeking low-cost oil
   leases from the Kazakhstan government.},

Title = {How much is citizenship worth? The case of Kyrgyzstani migrants in
   Kazakhstan and Russia},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {445-459},
Abstract = {In the past few decades, political membership has become more complex,
   for example, through the proliferation of dual and multiple
   citizenships. Some scholars argue that, as a result, state membership
   may have become less relevant to individuals. In the same vein, our
   article argues that Kyrgyzstani migrants working in Russia and
   Kazakhstan have developed a pragmatic approach to citizenship. This case
   study, which builds upon in-depth interviews conducted in April and May
   2008, is pertinent for several reasons. Labor migration from Kyrgyzstan
   has surged in recent years and is radically affecting the country's
   economy, society, and polity. Besides, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and
   Russia have been separate political units for less than two decades;
   transnational practices and attitudes are thus not new. Our results show
   that for Kyrgyzstani migrants in Russia and Kazakhstan, citizenship is
   mainly defined in terms of concrete, short-term benefits. They have
   difficulties formulating what it means to be a citizen beyond the
   expression of a vague patriotic support. Those who have naturalized,
   mostly in Russia, do it for convenience purposes without attaching much
   affective meaning to it. Most see their stay as temporary (particularly
   in Kazakhstan), are not engaged in diasporic organizations or
   activities, and are estranged from the politics of both their home and
   host country.},

Abstract = {We investigated wheat price relationships between the import-dependent
   countries in Central Asia and the South Caucasus and the Black Sea wheat
   exporters to assess wheat market efficiency. This is crucial for
   ensuring availability and access to wheat and for reducing food
   insecurity. Results from linear and threshold error correction models
   suggested a strong influence of trade costs on market integration in
   Central Asia, while those costs were of minor importance in the South
   Caucasus. In particular, wheat trade in Central Asia is characterized by
   higher transportation costs but unofficial payments also play a large
   role. In addition, wheat price volatility is substantially higher in the
   wheat importing countries of Central Asia compared to the South
   Caucasus. To foster market functioning, wheat trade should be
   facilitated by policies that reduce the costs of trade. These include
   investments in grain market infrastructure, eliminating unofficial
   payments, and resolving geopolitical conflicts. Additionally, large
   distances characterize wheat trade in this region, low scope for import
   diversification and repeated export restrictions by Black Sea exporters.
   Therefore, trade-enhancing policies should be complemented with policies
   that increase wheat self-sufficiency in order to improve food security.},

   effects of multiple factors on virtual water metabolic network (VWMN)
   through measuring water consumptions of different sectors. The developed
   TFA-IOM is applied to Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia to quantify its virtual
   water and identify its metabolic network, where agricultural and animal
   husbandry sectors are the main water consumers. Our major findings are:
   (i) Kyrgyzstan is a country relying on net virtual water import
   (reaching up to 3,242 x 10(6) m(3)); (ii) WHT (wheat) is the main
   virtual water supplier (with 349 x 10(6) m(3) virtual water to others);
   (iii) WHT, VGF (vegetables, fruit, and nuts), PFB (plant-based fibers),
   CTL (bovine cattle) and RMK (raw milk) are the main sectors affecting
   the VWMN (e.g., utility relationship and integral virtual water
   recycling index). From a long-term and sustainable development point
   view, stimulating Kyrgyzstan's domestic WHT and RMK productions and
   improving VGF, PFB and CTL water-use efficiencies can facilitate
   reducing net virtual water import and promoting the mutualism degree of
   the national VWMN. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Promoting sustainable development through civil society: A case study of
   the EU's NSA/LA thematic programme in Kyrgyzstan},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the contribution of the European Union (EU) in
   promoting sustainable development through the involvement of civil
   society in partner countries. More specifically, it analyses the main
   features and outcomes of the projects implemented by civil society
   organizations (CSOs) in Kyrgyzstan under the EU thematic programme
   Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development (NSA/LA). Despite
   its importance-this is the only EU programme providing direct support to
   non-state actors and local authorities engaged in poverty reduction-to
   date, there has been very little research on the functioning of this
   instrument on the ground. This article seeks to fill this gap in the
   literature by examining the EU's contribution to sustainable development
   through a case study on Kyrgyzstan. The study is based on primary data:
   10 semi-structured interviews conducted with the EU-funded organizations
   implementing the NSA/LA programme. The NSA/LA projects were analysed by
   considering two major fields of engagement of non-state actors in the
   development process: as service providers and as advocates (Banks \&
   Hulme, 2012). Overall, the organizations awarded EU support were not
   only focused on fulfilling short-term needs but also sought to introduce
   new ways of dealing with poverty and inequality, positioning themselves
   between the ``Big-D{''} and the ``little-d{''} approaches to development
   (Bebbington, Hickey, \& Mitlin, 2008). Nonetheless, the EU-funded
   projects were too limited and fragmented to be able to sustain long-term
   structural change. Therefore, the EU should place new emphasis on
   creating synergies between new and old structures at the grassroots
   level and establishing mechanisms and bodies that could merge and
   co-ordinate their efforts. In addition, the calls for proposals could
   highlight the need to share the lessons learnt by ``obliging{''} the
   beneficiaries to act as multipliers and to pass on their positive
   experience to neighbouring communities. Finally, the EU could stimulate
   the funded organizations to experiment with innovative mechanisms of
   involvement in the policy-making process, by making this aspect a
   mandatory requirement of the projects implemented with its support.},

Title = {Readiness for changes among managers of mining and metallurgy industry:

Abstract = {The object of the study in this article is iron ore mining enterprises
   of the mineral complex of Kazakhstan. Based on the conceptual provisions
   of the development of the mining industry of mineral resources of the
   country, we identified current priorities and constraints to improve the
   management system of mining and metallurgical enterprises. Also, we have
   identified the modern world trends in the management of mineral resource
   companies, which are focused on ensuring sustainable development,
   including minimal impact on the environment and ensuring social
   guarantees of companies' personnel. On the basis of the corporate survey
   of managers of various levels of mining and metallurgical companies, the
   authors assess the level of readiness of management to carry out
   appropriate improvements in their companies. The questionnaire was a
   symbiosis of corporate and expert surveys, implementing the task of
   obtaining information on both the internal situation and the views of
   managers as experts in the field of core business represented by
   managers of LLP ``Orken{''} which is a subsidiary of the largest miner
   in Kazakhstan - JSC ``ArcelorMittal Temirtau{''}.
   The subject of the study was the system of representations and
   installations of managers of mining and metallurgical company on the
   given parameters of measurement. The practical objectives of the study
   were to determine the general level of professional competence of
   managers of mining and metallurgical companies, to identify the main
   problem areas of process management in mining and metallurgical
   companies; to develop practical recommendations aimed at correcting the
   situation. According to the results of the study, the main problem is
   established from the point of view of the employees of the company. The
   structure of the organisation cannot be characterised as absolutely
   optimal and functional. One of the main reasons for the low
   functionality of the of the company's structure, according to the
   opinions of its managers, is the lack of clear qualification
   requirements for the functionality of the management sphere, and as a
   result of this a weak staff. The management of the company in its main
   activity does not ensure compliance with the requirements of sustainable
   development, and this acts as a natural constraint on the
   competitiveness of the enterprise and its compliance with modern global
   trends in the management of mining and metallurgical companies. It was
   determined that the existing management system of the mining and
   metallurgical companies of Kazakhstan is poorly prepared for possible
   changes in the external environment, and it requires the introduction of
   innovative technologies for managing production and logistics processes.},

Abstract = {The article looks at the phenomenon of Kazakhstan's ``wondering capital
   city{''} in the twentieth century, when, over the course of less than
   seventy-five years, four different cities had served as the republic's
   administrative center. The author suggests that decisions to relocate
   the capital to a new city before 1991 reflected structural shifts in the
   political and economic relations between Kazakhstan and the central
   government. Thus, the succession of relocations can be read as a
   narrative of the changing colonial condition of Kazakhstan in the
   twentieth century. This narrative helps us understand how the
   infrastructural and discursive legacies of imperial policies were
   inherited and reappropriated by post-Soviet Kazakhstan. From the vantage
   point of the metropole, the transfer of Kazakhstan's seat of government
   from Orenburg to Kzyl-Orda (formerly Perovsk and Ak-Mechet), then to
   Alma-Ata, and the development of Tselinograd (the future Astana) by the
   late 1950s were seen as elements of sociopolitical engineering serving
   economic progress. Each time, the new human and financial resources
   drawn to a new capital city boosted they city's development. These
   structural socioeconomic transformations also had a profound impact on
   the demographic situation, either marginalizing the Kazakh population or
   promoting its amalgamation with the newcomers, a process that produced a
   new local ethnocultural identity.},

Abstract = {Following a decade of transition in the Former Soviet Union (FSU),
   governance of the oil and gas sectors has evolved to economic
   nationalism. In the newly independent states this has manifested itself
   through greater (direct) state ownership or participation in oil and gas
   production, at the expense of both domestic (in the case of Russia) and
   international oil companies, as well as legislative developments that
   increase the flow of oil and gas value to the state. Here we analyse
   some of the dynamics giving rise to economic nationalism within a model
   of a state capacity and the ability to implement policy and extract
   value. Our analysis is based on the institutional and economic
   functioning of the oil and gas sector. We analyse a vector of
   institutions and examine Production Sharing Agreements and National Oil
   Companies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Reintroduction of highly mineralized Collector-Drainage Waters (CDW)
   enhances the salinity of inland waterbodies and limits water suitability
   for downstream users. Detailed quantitative and qualitative research
   based on the inter-annual and multiyear generation trends of CDW in
   Central Asia could help to improve the irrigation system for agriculture
   and furthermore in determining opportunities for reutilization and
   biodiversity protection. This is the first long-term research designed
   to study the discharge, salinity, and ionic composition of CDW in the
   Jizzakh region (Uzbekistan). A database of field measurements of
   salinity gathered during the field expeditions from 2000 to 2017 was
   used in the study. Spring season showed highest CDW discharge where
   April showed maximum while lowermost was recorded for summers,
   especially during August. All main collectors showed continuous
   increments in salinity over the last two decades. This was neither in
   correlation with CDW discharge nor salinity changes from the irrigation
   water source (Syrdarya river). A considerable increase of collectors'
   salinity within the range of 18\%-37\% was observed from upstream to
   downstream. The highest salinity values were observed during spring and
   lowest for summer with even lesser degree for the winter season. Among
   anions, sulfates were predominant followed by chlorides and
   bicarbonates; among cations, sodium was predominant followed by calcium
   and magnesium, which is different from the ionic composition of the
   water source. The study revealed that increased CDW discharge has not
   always resulted in low salinity and that high water years have not
   always caused a decline in CDW salinity showing that CDW discharge and
   salinity had differential dependence on each other.},

   article suggests two modifications to the Bourdieusian framework to
   reflect better the nature of local politics. First, despite lacking
   significant capital holdings, poor groups undertake everyday resistance
   and mediated politics. Second, intellectual and traditional elites
   engage in the politics of doing the right thing', motivated by a sense
   of moral obligation. The article provides a critical challenge to the
   concept of clan and elite-led politics which is often used to explain
   events in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates the `dilemma of difference' of post-conflict
   peacebuilding in the Kyrgyz Republic in Central Asia. Following
   inter-communal clashes in 2010, the country has received significant
   support in the form of peacebuilding and conflict prevention programmes
   and aid. Still, national policy makers retained their sovereignty and
   carried out peacebuilding in line with the country's historical legacy
   and cultural specificities. I illustrate the `dilemma of difference'
   precluding sustainable peacebuilding and conflict transformation in this
   context because, as Minow argues, difference and the disadvantage and
   stigma associated with it is either silenced and ignored or
   overemphasised, leading to marginalisation through victimisation. I
   trace the establishment of a territorialised and essentialised
   understanding of ethnicity through the social transformations of
   Kyrgyzstan in the early Soviet and the post-Soviet period. I then show
   how, since the `2010 events', authorities attempted to do peacebuilding
   and conflict prevention with appeals to multicultural peace and
   diversity through the Soviet-era idea of `people's friendship'. Such
   efforts and corresponding peacebuilding initiatives in southern
   Kyrgyzstani communities face, as I show, inherent contradictions given
   exclusionary national-level language and cultural policies and a focus
   on donor satisfaction which serve to brush over reported tensions,
   exclusion and conflict.},

Title = {Women's decision-making autonomy and utilization of antenatal, natal and
   post-natal healthcare services: Insights from Tajikistan's national
   surveys},

Abstract = {Background The purpose of this article is to investigate the link
   between women's autonomy and their utilization of antenatal, natal and
   post-natal healthcare services in Tajikistan. Previous studies focused
   only on a single dimension of such services, for instance, utilization
   of antenatal care. By contrast, we explore antenatal, natal and
   post-natal healthcare services utilization using the number of indicator
   for each of the dimensions. Methods Data come from two national surveys
   that were conducted in 2012 and 2017. The target population is women of
   reproductive age (16-49) who were married or cohabitating with a partner
   (N= 7540). Several regression models were estimated to quantify
   association between women's autonomy and the utilization. Results Lack
   of women's autonomy is associated with a lower probability of: (a)
   having had at least four antenatal check-ups during pregnancy, (b)
   beginning first antenatal check-up early, (c) delivering in a healthcare
   facility, (d) having the skilled attendance during pregnancy, (e) having
   a mother post-delivery check-up, and (f) having a child post-delivery
   check-up. The size effect of women's autonomy is stronger than that of
   well-developed precursors of utilization such as poverty and mothers'
   education. Conclusion Women autonomy should be improved to achieve
   higher rates of child and maternal healthcare utilization. Studies of
   maternal and child healthcare utilization should control explicitly for
   women's autonomy.},

Title = {Optimal Allocation of Surface Water Resources at the Provincial Level in

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Water users in the Amudarya River Basin in Uzbekistan are suffering
   severe water use competition and uneven water allocation, which
   seriously threatens ecosystems, as shown, for example, in the well-known
   Aral Sea catastrophe. This study explores the optimized water allocation
   schemes in the study area at the provincial level under different
   incoming flow levels, based on the current water distribution quotas
   among riparian nations, which are usually ignored in related research.
   The optimization model of the inexact two-stage stochastic programming
   method is used, which is characterized by probability distributions and
   interval values. Results show that (1) water allocation is redistributed
   among five different sectors. Livestock, industrial, and municipality
   have the highest water allocation priority, and water competition mainly
   exists in the other two sectors of irrigation and ecology; (2) water
   allocation is redistributed among six different provinces, and allocated
   water only in Bukhara and Khorezm can satisfy the upper bound of water
   demand; (3) the ecological sector can receive a guaranteed water
   allocation of 8.237-12.354 km(3); (4) under high incoming flow level,
   compared with the actual water distribution, the total allocated water
   of four sectors (except for ecology) is reduced by 3.706 km(3) and total
   economic benefits are increased by USD 3.885B.},

Title = {Measurements meet human observations: integrating distinctive ways of

   change},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {165},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {In mountain environments dimensions of climate change are unclear
   because of limited availability of meteorological stations. However,
   there is a necessity to assess the scope of local climate change, as the
   livelihood and food systems of subsistence-based communities are already
   getting impacted. To provide more clarity about local climate trends in
   the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, this study integrates measured
   climate data with community observations in the villages of Savnob and
   Roshorv. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, both knowledge systems
   were considered as equally pertinent and mutually informed the research
   process. Statistical trends of temperature and snow cover were retrieved
   using downscaled ERA5 temperature data and the snow cover product
   MOD10A1. Local knowledge was gathered through community workshops and
   structured interviews and analysed using a consensus index. Results
   showed, that local communities perceived increasing temperatures in
   autumn and winter and decreasing amounts of snow and rain. Instrumental
   data records indicated an increase in summer temperatures and a
   shortening of the snow season in Savnob. As both knowledge systems
   entail their own strengths and limitations, an integrative assessment
   can broaden the understanding of local climate trends by (i) reducing
   existing uncertainties, (ii) providing new information, and (iii)
   introducing unforeseen perspectives. The presented study represents a
   time-efficient and global applicable approach for assessing local
   dimensions of climate change in data-deficient regions.},

Abstract = {Even two decades after independence in 1991, the agricultural sector of
   Uzbekistan remains regulated by the government, prescribing the number
   of cattle head per agricultural area or imposing mandatory cash crops.
   The policy makers are insufficiently informed about the bottlenecks in
   the different livestock production units and base their policies mainly
   on general knowledge. This study analyzed the two major cattle farm
   types in the Khorezm province, 56 medium-scale farms (LS; on average 22
   ha) and 80 household farms (HH; on average 0.2 ha). While LS farms
   produced more metabolizable energy and crude protein than required by
   their own ruminant livestock, the feeds produced by HH farms covered
   only a third of the requirements. Despite their limited farm size, the
   HH farmers took an active part in the commercial farming sector, for
   example, through the purchase of inputs for cattle and crop production,
   and product sales. The HH farms generated higher relative crop yields
   than their LS counterparts, while cattle productivity of both was
   comparable, albeit low. The present findings can be considered as a
   benchmark for monitoring developments in the cattle sector and as a
   source of information for directing improvements in feed supply, cattle
   health and husbandry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Optimization of the Thermal Insulation Level of Residential Buildings in
   the Almaty Region of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan is country rich in energy resources, but to raise the living
   standards of the country's population, the government regulates prices
   of heating energy, which are significantly lower comparing to those in
   the global energy market. Such an approach encourages the construction
   of residential buildings without concern for their energy efficiency,
   which significantly increases energy consumption in the sector and leads
   to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of regulated
   low prices of heating energy on long-term energy use in buildings, to
   determine optimal levels of building thermal insulation at current
   energy prices and following global energy price trends, and to
   demonstrate the impact of more efficient building thermal insulation on
   heating energy consumption from a long-time perspective. The
   cost-optimal method used in EU countries was chosen for the optimization
   of building thermal insulation and energy consumption to compare the
   impact of energy prices on the optimal thermal insulation of buildings.
   The results of the study showed that maintaining low energy prices
   hinders the implementation of energy-efficient solutions in buildings
   and does not provide an economic justification for prolonging the
   heating season by ensuring the quality of the indoor microclimate. As a
   practical result of this study, a recommendation was made to introduce
   optimal thermal insulation requirements in building regulations and to
   redistribute part of the energy subsidies for implementation of
   energy-efficient measures in the residential building sector.},

Abstract = {What motivates financially savvy and well-to-do Kazakhstanis to invest
   in illegal financial products peddled by informal financial consultants?
   This article examines how such consultants capitalize on citizens'
   discontent with the state and its management of the financial sphere and
   position their products as means of achieving socialist-era security
   through Western financial technologies. By attending to the emergent
   space between idealized socialism and capitalism, this article grounds
   finance in kin relations, gender inequities, and local economic and
   political histories and explores how socialist conceptions of retirement
   and money management are reimagined and practised in relation to
   state-led financialization.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Developing effective international joint ventures (IJVs) is critical for
   firms entering economies in transition, such as Kazakhstan. The
   resource-based view of the firm forms the foundation to examine the
   influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners. Traditionally, the
   transfer of knowledge between IJV partners has been theorized to lessen
   dependence, increasing IJV instability. However, the relationship
   development literature indicates that the exchange of assets between
   partners can strengthen relationship ties, enhancing IJV stability. The
   authors use a sample of 87 matched dyads from two-party IJVs formed in
   Kazakhstan to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV
   partners on commitment and resulting satisfaction. The results,
   supportive of relationship development theory, indicate that
   Kazakhstan-foreign IJVs with higher levels of knowledge transfer
   resulted in higher levels of firms' commitment to and satisfaction with
   their relationships, thus supporting a relationship development
   perspective of knowledge transfer. The authors address implications for
   academics and practitioners.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {359-373},
Abstract = {The city of Aksu, situated at the northern fringe of the Taklimakan
   Desert in northwest China, is exposed to severe periodic dust and sand
   storms. In 1986, local authorities decided to establish a peri-urban
   shelterbelt plantation, the so-called Kokyar Protection Forest, with the
   aim of reducing dust and sand storm impacts on Aksu City by the
   regulating ecosystem services provided by the plantation. It was
   realised as a patchwork of poplar shelterbelts and orchards. The total
   area of the plantation reached 3800 ha in 2005. The Kokyar Protection
   Forest is used as a case study to answer the following question: under
   which institutional frameworks and to which financial conditions can
   peri-urban shelterbelts be established and maintained? The endeavour of
   planting the shelterbelt was made possible by the annual mass
   mobilisation of Aksu citizens, based on the Chinese regulation of the
   ``National Compulsory Afforestation Campaigns{''}. Establishment costs
   amounted to ca. CNY 60 000 ha(-1) (ca. USD 10 000 ha(-1)). Permanent
   maintenance of the plantation is facilitated by leasing orchard plots to
   private fruit farmers. From the perspective of the local economy, annual
   farming net benefits generated by Kokyar fruit farmers more than
   compensate for annual government grants for maintenance, resulting in an
   average overall monetary net benefit of at least CNY 10 500 ha(-1) (ca.
   USD 1600 ha(-1)) in the long term. For a more complete understanding of
   Kokyar Protection Forest, future research should be directed towards
   quantifying the effect of its regulating ecosystem services and on
   investigating the negative downstream consequences of its water
   consumption.},

Title = {Exploring the differences between men's and women's perceptions of
   gender-based violence in rural Tajikistan: a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC WOMENS HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundMost women living in rural provinces of Tajikistan,
   specifically Khatlon, experience little to no opportunities for
   education and economic growth, making them vulnerable to gender-based
   violence (GBV). Unfortunately due to social norms that are bolstered by
   a patriarchal society, GBV has become tolerated and even normalized in
   rural areas. This study looks to investigate the differences in
   perceptions of violence as it relates to empowerment among men and women
   in rural Tajikistan.MethodsData collection was done through
   participatory workshops and semi-structured interviews (SSI) that were
   led by Extension Home Economists, which lectured on gender, violence,
   and empowerment. Community Empowerment Drawings is a novel tool that has
   been used to further gather sensitive information that was not
   previously discussed. During this process, participant groups were asked
   to draw their perception of empowered versus disempowered women, later
   explaining the different characteristics and traits of both. Random
   participants across both genders were later contacted for a SSI to
   triangulate the data from the participatory workshops. This qualitative
   study implemented qualitative content analysis to explore the data
   inductively. Analysis of the drawings and transcripts from the workshops
   and SSIs included two researchers coding through an iterative process.
   Themes were stratified by men's and women's perceptions and codebooks
   were compared to ensure consensus.ResultsMen and women from 12 villages
   participated in the Community Empowerment Drawings within each workshop,
   with 234 participants total. Results were stratified into two categories
   which were later broken down into notable themes: education, employment,
   decision-making, marital status, relationship wellness and respect,
   violence, mental health, and substance abuse. Major findings illustrated
   how disempowered women were perceived to have more exposure to men who
   experience alcohol abuse. This study found that differences in
   perceptions of empowerment between men and women remain-with men still
   holding onto the traditional power structure within a household and
   women challenging gender roles and mobility.ConclusionFuture studies may
   find engaging communities through drawings will yield more information
   regarding sensitive topics rather than traditional instruments. More
   support and advocacy are needed in areas of mental, neurological, and
   substance abuse disorders throughout rural Tajikistan.},

Title = {Impacts Assessments without True Baselines: Assessing the Relative
   Effects of Training on the Performance of Water User Associations in
   Southern Tajikistan},
Journal = {WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Conducting rigorous evaluations of whether the process of creating new
   institutions affects their performance of mandated duties presents
   several challenges. Not only is assignment to process often not random,
   but when the process of creating new institutions starts, outcomes and
   other performance-influencing covariates are not measurable because the
   yet-to-be created institutions are not functioning at baseline. This
   paper compares the performance of 74 `treated' water user associations
   (WUAs) in Tajikistan that were created using a longer training process
   with 67 `control' WUAs that were created using shorter training, to
   assess the impact of training on WUA performance of mandated duties.
   First, propensity scores were constructed to estimate the probabilities
   of being `treated' by treatment status. These results guided the
   application of the difference-in-difference technique with right-hand
   side covariates in a context where field measures of outcomes and other
   performance-influencing covariates were made after the new institutions
   were created and functioning. The first measures were taken within 12-18
   months of the new institutions being functional and the second measures
   were taken 24 months after the first. This choice of methods introduces
   a bias due to measurement error causing an underestimate of the
   treatment effects, while controlling for biases due to time-invariant
   and time-varying unobservables. An alternative method that only compared
   the differences in outcomes at a single point in time after the new
   institutions were created would have provided an inaccurate estimate of
   the effects of the intervention. This is a context in which methods such
   as synthetic controls are impossible to employ due to the nature of the
   intervention, other macroeconomic structural changes, and severe data
   restrictions. The methodology employed here generates evidence that,
   while biased toward generating an underestimate of effect, can still be
   useful and informative for policy and management purposes, and for
   evaluating the impact of process on the functioning of new institutions
   in transition settings.},

Title = {Mapping weather risk-A multi-indicator analysis of satellite-based
   weather data for agricultural index insurance development in semi-arid
   and arid zones of Central Asia},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Index insurance has been introduced as a solution to tackle several
   challenges that prevail in the agricultural insurance sector of
   developing countries. One of the main implementation challenges in these
   countries is the lack of reliable weather data for index development and
   implementation. The increasing availability of satellite data could ease
   the constraints of data access. Meanwhile, the suitability of various
   satellite products for yield estimation across world regions has to
   undergo a thorough assessment. This study contributes to the literature
   by systematically analyzing the accuracy of some globally available
   satellite data, namely the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
   (GSMaP), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station
   (CHIRPS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) compared
   to ground-level weather information for 14 different indicators for the
   case of Uzbekistan. Our analysis indicates that those sources may
   provide the necessary data for an accessible and adequate climate
   service. However, a considerable risk of overestimation and
   underestimation depending on the source of satellite data may exist,
   especially for precipitation data in the conditions of Central Asia.
   Among the tested datasets, GSMaP showed a relatively better performance
   than CHIRPS in precipitation estimation for drought and flood detection.
   In order to reduce detection inaccuracy, the application of satellite
   weather products for index insurance is possible when temporal
   aggregation (e.g., monthly, seasonal) is considered. Globally available
   climate data could serve as a good source to establish index insurance
   products in Central Asia; however, a careful selection of source and
   index is required.},

Title = {International students in Kazakhstan A narrative inquiry of human agency
   in the process of adaptation},

Abstract = {Purpose Kazakhstan has taken considerable steps to improve the incoming
   mobility of international students; however, despite these measures, the
   number of international students studying in Kazakhstan is still very
   low. Research indicates that in order to attract and retain
   international students it is necessary to build a thorough understanding
   of their experiences in the host country. The purpose of this paper is
   to gain a better understanding of international students' experiences in
   Kazakhstan by exploring how they exercise their human agency while
   adapting to the academic and socio-cultural life in Kazakhstan.
   Design/methodology/approach The author used a purposeful criterion
   sampling to select six international students from Afghanistan, Great
   Britain, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the USA studying at
   Kazakhstani universities to participate in this research. The primary
   data collection was semi-structured in-depth interviews. Supportive
   methods included a demographic questionnaire and a researcher journal.
   Findings The study revealed that the international students actively
   employed their human agency to negotiate their studying and to adapt to
   their life in Kazakhstan. They did not simply adjust to the host
   environment, but also learned from it and attempted to transform it
   according to their circumstances and goals. Research
   limitations/implications - The implication is that Kazakhstani
   universities and any other higher education institutions that seek to
   increase the number of their international students should consider not
   only how to attract these students, but also how to adapt their
   institution's practices and regulations to create an inclusive learning
   environment for their diverse student population. It is also very
   important for higher education institutions to provide international
   students with the necessary conditions to exercise their human agency
   because as it was revealed by this study, international students' human
   agency is a very powerful mechanism helping them live and learn
   comfortably in their host country. Originality/value Taking into
   consideration the reviewed previous research, this was the first attempt
   to use Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory for the purpose of
   building an understanding about how international students exercise
   their agency while adapting to the academic and socio-cultural life in
   the host country. The social cognitive theory allows investigating
   international students as active and self-sufficient agents of their own
   adaptation process who can and do change themselves, and have the
   potential to navigate and alter their host environment to achieve their
   own goals. This study encourages researchers and practitioners to think
   about international students outside the dimension of
   internationalization as a means of improving country's economic capital.},

Abstract = {Taking the pertinent data from the 22 countries along the economic
   corridor of western and central Asia and China from 2012 to 2019 as the
   samples, the performance of international logistics of countries of
   western and central Asia was described and the impact of the performance
   of international logistics of countries along the economic corridor of
   western and central Asia on export of China's agricultural products was
   carried out by using a gravity model. The results revealed that the GDP,
   population, mutual neighbourhood, S member countries and improvement of
   the performance of international logistics of western and Central Asia
   have significant promoting effect on the growth of export of China's
   agricultural products. Different sub-indexes of international logistics
   performance in western and central Asia exerted different influences on
   the export trade of China's agricultural products. Therefore, in order
   to better promote the development of export trade of China's
   agricultural products, China should make joint efforts with countries of
   western and central Asia to make use of the opportunities brought by the
   `Belt and Road Initiative' ('B\&R') to improve the connectivity of
   logistics infrastructure and deepen the cooperation of China and

Abstract = {The article discusses approaches to justifying and implementing
   nation-wide priorities in the field of environmental policy of Russia
   and Kazakhstan. Data on the role of national priorities as substantial
   determinants that define vectors and specific mechanisms for
   implementing environmental policy in post-Soviet countries and countries
   with the advanced market economy are systematised. The relationship
   between national priorities and priorities of supranational
   environmental policy implemented by global international organisations
   (UN-Sustainable Development Goals; EU- Environmental Policy Goals until
   2050; BRICS - Environmental Initiatives) is substantiated. The key
   characteristics of national priorities in the field of environmental
   policy of Russia and Kazakhstan are compared, including review of the
   approaches of global international organisations; prioritised areas and
   fields of public environmental policy; implemented funding mechanisms
   and organisational forms; approaches to institutionalising the
   priorities of public environmental policy within the existing public
   administration system. Problems of implementation of environmental
   policy priorities in Russia and Kazakhstan are identified and their
   causes are substantiated. At the same time, special attention is paid to
   the study of how national priorities of environmental policy are
   translated into regional management decisions; identification of gaps
   between the formulated national priorities and their implementation
   procedures in specific industrial regions of Russia and Kazakhstan. The
   best practices for implementing environmental policy priorities at the
   national and regional levels are compared. Finally, conclusions about
   ways to improve environmental policy mechanisms and the possibilities of
   distribution of the best regional practices identified are drawn. The
   empirical basis of the analysis was obtained from the results of studies
   carried out as part of the research work ``Improvement of the state
   policy regulation for accelerated clustering of the industrial
   regions{''}, executed under grant financing of the Ministry of Education

Abstract = {During the past 10 years, the oil market has been very unpredictable and
   volatile, which created uneasy conditions for market participants. The
   remedy of increasing oil prices is considered as a positive factor for
   the economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan as an oil-exporting country.
   Using structural decomposition of vector autoregression (VAR), this
   study aims to examine how the whole financial system in Kazakhstan is
   depending on oil prices. The results suggest that the strongest factor
   affecting the stock index is aggregate demand, and the impact of oil
   production shocks on the equity market is, on average, insignificant.
   Such shocks can be discounted while a fall in oil prices affects
   financial conditions as a whole, damaging the solvency of Kazakhstan, an
   oil-exporting country. With the positive shock of aggregate demand, the
   stock market index tends to rise. There is also an effect of oil price
   volatility on changes in currency value, which also influences the
   financial situation of the country. Moreover, oil-exporting countries
   such as Kazakhstan can secure and support their economies with the help
   of ``stable aggregate demand{''}. The focus on Kazakhstan as one of the
   oil-producing countries is interesting for at least two reasons.
   Importantly, oil-exporting countries supply oil to really strong
   countries concentrating on manufacturing and other industries. Besides,
   this study provides useful insights for countries with similar economic
   conditions, including similar stock market development.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes Kazakhstan's influencing factors of energy-related
   carbon emissions in different stages, and the study period (1992-2014)
   was divided into four stages by using the logarithmic mean Divisia index
   (LMDI) method. In the low efficiency and high output stage, Kazakhstan
   had the most energy-related carbon emissions. The total energy-related
   carbon emissions might be positive or negative in the high efficiency
   and high output stage and the low efficiency and low output stage, and
   this was mainly determined by the energy intensity effect or the
   economic output effect. Different influencing factors had different
   effects in the different stages from 1992 to 2014. The economic output
   effect was the first contributor for promoting energy-related carbon
   emissions, and the energy intensity factor was the first contributor for
   suppressing energy-related carbon emissions from 1992 to 2014. Finally,
   policy recommendations in terms of the main influencing factors are put
   forward, including the low-carbon economic development mode
   transformation, technological innovation, and renewable energy
   development.},

Abstract = {The article deals with issues and challenges related to the transition
   of Kazakhstan's economy to industrial-innovative development, including
   the main causes for low innovation activities of enterprises, and
   peculiarities of the development of an effective mechanism to finance
   innovation activities and to strengthen the country's intellectual
   capital Currently, countries that implement long-term innovative
   development strategies satisfying the needs of a diverse market have
   competitive advantages in the market.
   The present research enables us to identify and analyse problems of
   formation and development of Kazakhstan's industrial and innovative
   economy, namely the lack of application of research results in business,
   inadequate and ineffective funding (both public and private) of
   innovation activities, as well as little support and encouragement for
   scientists as major participants in innovation activities.
   It has been concluded that nowhere in the world has a national
   innovation system been formed by the market or private sector alone.
   Kazakhstan is not an exception. Therefore, the state must play the
   leading role in both promoting the results of R\&D and innovation
   activities in the market and creating the national innovation system.},

Abstract = {The authors conduct a comparative analysis of the features and content
   of socio-pedagogical work with gifted schoolchildren in the educational
   space of Russia and Kazakhstan. The purpose of our study: to study and
   present the comparative experience of socio-pedagogical work with gifted
   children in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Collection of
   empirical data was carried out by questionnaire survey of teachers of
   general educational organizations of the Russian Federation (n=225) and
   educational organizations of Kazakhstan (n=200). The survey of teachers
   and specialists of educational organizations was conducted in 2018 and
   2019.The authors have studied the comparative experience of organizing
   socio-pedagogical work with gifted schoolchildren in Russia and
   Kazakhstan. The results allow us to see common and specific in the work
   with gifted children in the Russian Federation and the former
   post-Soviet republic. The identified features can be taken into account
   in the organization of socio-pedagogical work with gifted schoolchildren
   and improve the effectiveness of socio-pedagogical work and
   socio-pedagogical support of gifted schoolchildren. In conclusion, the
   study of comparative experience of socio-pedagogical work with gifted
   schoolchildren in two countries with a similar history of formation of
   educational systems allows us to see the difference in approaches to
   work with this non-standard category of children at the moment. The
   identified specificity in the programs, forms and methods, target
   benchmarks of socio-pedagogical work with gifted children in educational
   organizations can be taken into account when developing the content of
   this direction of work and will improve its effectiveness.},

Abstract = {This article examines the system of checks and balances in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan in general and the role of the Parliament of Kazakhstan in
   that system in particular. As opposed to the scientific mainstream in
   Kazakhstan which explains established system of checks and balances as a
   result of formal constitutional reforms, this article undertakes broader
   analytical framework and examines the system of checks and balances in
   Kazakhstan taking into account a correlation of formal and informal
   practices. The goal of the article is to show that in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan the separation of powers is established without proper checks
   and balances. The inference drawn from the article is that the
   separation of powers in Kazakhstan is blocked by the strong
   constitutional and informal powers of the President, which allows him to
   control and interfere in affairs of all branches of power. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {This article examines how reputational concerns drove the adoption of
   the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Kazakhstan.
   The article argues that Kazakhstan's decision to join EITI was largely
   driven by the government's intention to use EITI as a rational
   governance tool to manipulate its political agenda to protect the
   regime's legitimacy. However, norm adherence does not reflect effective
   compliance. The findings of EITI in Kazakhstan show that the adoption of
   EITI standardized requirements followed a specific internal logic that
   disconnects from the initiative's initial purpose. The case of
   Kazakhstan further illustrates the limitations of external remedies to
   the `resource curse' and emphasises the significance of vertical
   accountability in political regimes. The article urges scholars and
   policy advisers to further investigate how global governance
   arrangements are implemented at domestic levels, particularly in
   autocratic regimes.},

Title = {Identifying optimal virtual water management strategy for Kazakhstan: A
   factorial ecologically-extended input-output model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {297},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Virtual water is an important indicator measuring the amount of water
   needed from the perspective of consumption, which can help decision
   makers to identify desired system design and optimal management strategy
   against water resources shortage. In this study, a novel model named as
   factorial ecologically-extended input-output model (abbreviated as
   FEIOM) is developed for virtual water management. FEIOM integrates
   techniques of input-output model (IOM), ecological network analysis
   (ENA) and factorial analysis (FA) into a general framework. It is
   effective to evaluate the virtual water flows, reveal ecological
   inter-connections in virtual water system (VWS), and identify key water
   consumption sectors that have significant individual and interactive
   effects on VWS' s performance. FEIOM is then applied to identifying
   optimal virtual water management strategies for Kazakhstan in Central
   Asia. The main findings are: (i) Kazakhstan is a net importer of virtual
   water (reaching up to 46.0 x 10(9) m(3)), demonstrating that the
   national economic structure is reasonable, which can abate the national
   water scarcity and improve its eco-environmental protection; (ii) the
   virtual water of agricultural sector is net exporter, where vegetables,
   fruits and nuts occupy 86\% of the total agricultural exports; the
   massive export of water-intensive products further squeezes the water
   for other users; (iii) the key factors affecting the national VWS are
   agriculture > primary manufacturing > advanced manufacturing > services.
   Therefore, from solving water resources shortage and facilitating
   sustainable development perspectives, Kazakhstan should stimulate the
   domestic primary manufacturing productions and improve agriculture and
   advanced manufacturing water-use efficiencies.},

Abstract = {The inability to organize collective action for pest control can lead to
   severe problems. This paper focuses on the locust management system in
   Kazakhstan since the formation of the Soviet State. During the
   Transition Period after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Plant
   Protection Service disintegrated. The principles of central planning
   were replaced with individualistic approaches with little state
   involvement in pest control activities or pesticide regulation. The
   financial and ideological reasons for dismantling the existing pest
   control system did not recognize the potential impact that
   policy-induced changes in agro-ecological conditions and control
   practices would have on pest development. Nature hit back at the induced
   institutional change that occurred in the Kazakh pest control system: an
   extremely harmful locust plague took the country by surprise between
   1998 and 2001. This paper examines from an interdisciplinary perspective
   the co-evolution of locust populations, land use systems, knowledge
   about locusts, campaigns against them, and institutions in Soviet times
   and in the Transition Period. It argues the need for collective action
   theory to extend its present focus from local level institutions for
   resource management to higher level social-technical systems.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article is to examine patterns of similarities and
   differences across educational reforms in the Czech Republic and
   Kazakhstan in post-socialist context. The study conducted a
   comparative-historical analysis of the development of education systems
   in Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic in the 1990s when there was a
   transition of these countries from the socialist to the capitalist
   regime.
   The comparative historical analysis of the educational reforms of these
   two countries identified a number of similar patterns and considerable
   differences in the development of their education systems due to many
   contextual and structural factors and historical prerequisites. The
   comparative analysis demonstrated that both in the educational systems
   of the Czech Republic and Kazakhstan democratization, humanization and
   differentiation were taken as main principles of the reforms, but these
   processes developed in different levels and directions.
   As a result, it was stated that both the Czech Republic and Kazakhstan
   intended to democratize educational systems in the post-socialist
   context. While the Czech Republic tended to decentralize and diversify
   the school system, delegating the practical implementation of
   educational policies to various organizations and lobbying groups,
   however, Kazakhstan maintains a highly centralized system from top to
   bottom, which leaves little administrative, financial, managerial,
   executive authority for the low structures of the state apparatus and
   the public, which limits the system to strict planning and standards.},

   incorporated to assess the impact of various macroeconomics
   determinants. The results indicate the existence of a cointegration
   relationship, and the employment elasticity of output growth in
   Kazakhstan's economy has declined at aggregate and sectoral levels, thus
   indicating jobless growth. More specifically, the results reveal that
   inflation, trade openness and the exchange rate are negatively
   associated with employment elasticity. In contrast, a positive
   association is established between service sector employment share, the
   population growth rate and employment elasticity of output growth. The
   study recommends strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals such as
   inflation and exchange rate stabilization coupled with robust
   development of human capital.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan has been at the forefront of, power sector reform in EBRD's
   countries of operations. Starting in 1996, a regulator was set up, the
   industry was partially unbundled, some distribution and generation
   companies were privatised, and the large user market was liberalised. A
   number of reform challenges remain however in the area of privatisation,
   regulation and competition. The paper proposes that the remaining
   distribution companies be privatised with a view to raising the level of
   cash collection. Before this takes place, the industry would benefit
   from regulatory changes, strengthening independence of the regulator and
   modifying regulatory rules to improve risk allocations and strengthen
   incentives. On competition, the paper proposes enhancing the present
   market arrangements by introducing a balancing pool, and re-balancing
   transmission tariffs to reflect location marginal costs. Implementation
   of the proposed changes should yield substantial welfare gains for
   Kazakhstan. The broad challenges in Kazakhstan are characteristic of
   those in the sector throughout the region. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Based on objective data (the number of works written in major genres), I
   reveal a wave of decline and growth in the creative activity of
   Kazakhstan composers, which spanned two decades between 1990-ies and
   2010-s. The article is devoted to an attempt to identify the external
   and internal causes of such statistics. The influence of the historical
   situation and the transformations of the cultural and ideological plan
   on musical creativity is analyzed. In my opinion,external factors
   affecting the creative activity of Kazakhstan composers are political
   changes and the ideological transformations associated with them,
   economic downturns and ups, as well as a system of intercultural
   interaction that is naturally transforming in the global world. A very
   indicative situation in the field of musical theater, which can be
   extrapolated to other genre spheres. It demonstrates a decline
   throughout the second half of the 1980s until the early 2000s.
   Among the factors that influenced the growth of creative activity in the
   late 1990s and early 2000s, state programs for the preservation of
   cultural heritage, new music festivals Nauryz-21, new technical
   capabilities (the emergence of modern recording equipment and computers,
   informatization) should be mentioned, expanding the scope of
   international and intercultural contacts. One of the most noticeable
   results of the activation of composer creativity was the formation of
   Kazakhstan polystylistics, which is characterized by a multi-vector
   combination of styles not only from different eras, but also from
   different musical and cultural traditions.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {503-525},
Abstract = {This article challenges the ahistorical figure of the `steppe nomad' by
   presenting some of the main characteristics of Kazakh nomadic
   pastoralism, which vary widely in time and space. It compares two
   ethnographic studies conducted a century apart in the same place in
   south-eastern Kazakhstan: a statistical survey from 1910 and an account
   of a transhumance in which the author took part in June 2012. Sedentary
   pastoralism now prevails in Kazakhstan, but a system of seasonal
   pastures endures in some areas. In Raiymbek District (Almaty Province),
   vertical nomadism takes advantage of the altitudinal variations of
   vegetation and climate. This article demonstrates both the continuity of
   nomadic routes despite successive crises during the twentieth century,
   and considers the overall change from quasi-nomadism to
   quasi-sedentarism. This comparison a century apart also fosters dialogue
   between history and social anthropology through a dual synchronic
   approach, seeking to restore historicity to our understanding of
   pastoral nomadism.},

Abstract = {The choice of an entry mode is one of the most critical decisions for
   firms expanding abroad. There are a variety of foreign market entry
   modes such as exporting, licensing, and foreign direct investment. While
   many firms use only one single mode, others frequently employ multiple
   different combined modes for a foreign entry simultaneously. Mode
   combination can be an effective way to achieve better performance in
   foreign operation because the different modes in a combination package
   complement each other. The topic of mode combination, however, has not
   yet been extensively studied theoretically and empirically. In this
   paper, we propose six hypotheses to examine factors affecting firms'
   choice between a single mode and a combined mode and test them on
   questionnaire survey data regarding Korean manufacturing firms' recent
   entry into Uzbekistan.},

   Relying on an original data-set of statutory tariffs we find that trade
   creation effects were significant only in trade between Russia and third
   countries, but that there was some trade destruction, with a significant
   negative impact on imports from China to Kazakhstan and Russia, and on
   imports from the EU to Belarus. However, the magnitude of this effect is
   relatively small, suggesting that the benefits of the new tariff policy
   per se are limited at best.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the macroeconomic consequences of an alternative
   fiscal rule in the context of commodity price shocks for a
   commodity-exporting country. We build a DSGE model to explain the
   business cycle in an oil-exporting economy, estimated using
   macroeconomic data from Kazakhstan. Our results demonstrate that when
   fiscal policy is procyclical in response to a transitory negative oil
   price shock, and if a majority of households are non-Ricardian, then a
   one standard deviation drop in oil prices causes an output decline of
   about 0.19\%. In contrast, if the fiscal policy is countercyclical and
   conducted according to the structural balance fiscal rule, output
   increases by about 0.13\% in response to the same shock. We also eport
   that countercyclical fiscal policy is robustly effective when the
   monetary policy is characterized by its active inflation stabilization

Abstract = {The general perception of Western analysts and observers is that the
   nation-states created as a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union all
   treat the memory of the dark, repressive aspects of the Stalinist regime
   in public spaces as a symbolic element in the creation of a new
   post-Soviet identity {[}Denison, Michael. 2009. ``The Art of the
   Impossible: Political Symbolism, and the Creation of National Identity
   and Collective Memory in Post-Soviet Turkmenistan.{''} Europe-Asia
   Studies 61 (7): 1167-1187]. We argue that the government of Kazakhstan
   employs non-nationalistic discourse in its treatment of Stalinist
   victims' commemoration in a variety of forms, through the creation of
   modern memorial complexes at the sites of horrific Soviet activity (mass
   burial places, labor camps, and detention centers), purpose-built museum
   exhibitions, and the commemorative speeches of its president and other

Abstract = {The collapse of the USSR significantly affected the economic and
   political situation of all the republics which gained sovereignty as a
   result. Among them were countries such as Estonia and Kazakhstan. This
   article considers whether these countries have coped with the new
   political conditions. Using known economic indicators, a comparison was
   made of the economic and financial situation of both countries, pointing
   to the potential causes of diversification of their socio-economic
   development. Currently, Estonia is considered the most developed country
   of the 15 former members of the USSR, and Kazakhstan is in 5th place.
   The research carried out in this paper shows that the current economy of
   Kazakhstan is clearly moving away from that Estonia needs radical
   measures to achieve economic acceleration. The authors, analyzing the
   strategic activity of Estonia and Kazakhstan and the independence of
   financial management, concluded that these have had a significant impact
   on the current state of economic and financial development of the
   countries in question.},

Title = {Institutional logic meets global imagining: Kazakhstan's engagement with

Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-253},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Theoretical ideas about globalization and internationalization of higher
   education emphasize the tension among different ideologies of higher
   education. According to literature, a competition among states, economy,
   knowledge, and status generates this tension to drive higher education
   development. This theoretical understanding not only shapes our global
   imaginations but also permeates the organizational behavior of
   universities. In this paper, we focus on the institutional logics that
   motivate universities in Kazakhstan to engage with China's ambitious
   Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). We investigate the ways that Kazakhstani
   higher education interprets and responds to China's vision of a global
   order. Based on interviews conducted at 10 higher education institutions
   (HEIs) in Kazakhstan, we argue that Kazakhstan's engagement with the BRI
   circumvents the cultural connectivity and global cooperation that are
   embraced by Chinese policy discourse and perpetuated by academic
   literature. Rather, institutional leaders in Kazakhstan operate with a
   utilitarian logic that seeks revenue generation, links with industry,
   and opportunities for students in employment and further education. The
   pursuit of these strategic outcomes demonstrates a bilateral engagement
   with China rather than the multilateral cooperation envisioned by
   policymakers. In a higher education system dominated by the state, the
   institutions in our study exhibit partial agency to accrue pragmatic
   benefits rather than concede to isomorphic pressures or mimic
   internationalization from neoliberal contexts. The discrepancy between
   policy discourse from China and policy reception in Kazakhstan raises
   questions about the rhetoric of a multipolar global order and the
   realities of international cooperation in higher education.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of contemporary Uzbek agrarian change.
   First, using mixed methods and triangulating secondary and primary data
   from Samarkand, it untangles emerging relations of production and
   exchange during the slow processes of market transition. It shows that
   different types of public investment, price regulation, subsidies,
   procurement mechanisms, and the pace of marketization to which crops are
   subject shaped a slow growth of rural social differentiation and private
   accumulation. Traditionally, cotton farms have been in a privileged
   position because they have access to more land and subsidized inputs of
   production. However, due to recent fast-track liberalization policies
   and state-led investment, farms producing high value crops-fruit and
   vegetables-are at the forefront of a new pattern of private
   accumulation. Second, the article reflects on how the gradual approach
   to market transition has so far squeezed private accumulation, enabling
   the centralization of surplus extraction from cotton and wheat. This
   state-led accumulation strategy is slowly fading, leaving space for
   market-oriented reforms that will entail new but uncertain
   distributional and developmental outcomes within and outside
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {How do new media contribute to political participation among young

   question remains an understudied area in the former Soviet Union.
   Drawing on data collected during one year of fieldwork that included
   online surveys, interviews and focus groups with young people in both
   Russia and Kazakhstan, this study demonstrates that new media contribute
   to both on- and offline political participation in Russia and Kazakhstan
   among young people through: awareness as a prerequisite for political
   participation; communication; interaction; advocacy as political
   participation; mobilization; organizing; coordination; and hype-ization.
   In so doing, it offers a theoretical model that explains how new media
   contribute to young people's political participation in Russia and
   Kazakhstan, providing an in-depth account from two post-Communist cases
   which can contribute to cross-national comparative studies in

Title = {Quality of life as an indicator of public management performance in the
   Republic of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {184},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {133-153},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {We examine quality of life issues in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Based
   on systematization of theoretical approaches to the definition of a
   concept and structure of living standards found in scientific literature
   and their critical analysis, we have identified and justified the
   fundamental structural blocks of the quality of life as a complex
   aggregate indicator reflecting the level of development of many areas of
   a modern person's life together affecting the degree of his or her life
   activity's efficiency.
   Using an extensive range of statistical data and tools of economic and
   mathematical modeling, we aim to identify the degree of influence of
   macroeconomic indicators that characterize certain areas of human life
   (healthcare, education, living conditions, security, income level, etc.)
   on living standards.
   Given the above, the central hypothesis of this study is that public
   management of the quality of life in the Republic of Kazakhstan can be
   more effective if it provides a scientifically grounded system of tools
   based on the assessment of the quality of life which takes into account
   both regional and industry specifics, feedback from the population as a
   recipient of public services, and is based on the principle of
   integration and consistency of state body management decisions.
   Results we have obtained imply the existence of a correlation between
   such quantitative indicators as natural growth, a number of pension
   recipients, the Gini coefficient and the quality of life index
   determined by qualitative indicators: general life satisfaction of the
   population and the level of perception of happiness. Results of the
   study confirm current trends in the socio-economic development of
   Kazakhstan, characterized by income inequality issues in both
   intersectoral and interregional sections, aggravated against the
   background of the global pandemic threat, the recession of a prolonged
   nature, and other external shocks and challenges.
   Based on the results obtained, the authors conclude that the key causes
   of socio-economic differentiation in Kazakhstan are associated with a
   weak institutional environment and weak performance of formal
   institutions. The quality of institutions impacts the process of
   socio-economic development in a creative way, including through the
   formation of an appropriate institutional environment regulating the
   entire set of socio-economic relations. This circumstance emphasizes the
   priority of challenges state management bodies face in the context of
   improving the existing institutional environment, which allows
   determination of rational behavior boundaries for people and economic
   entities to optimize and stabilize the socio-economic development of the
   state as a whole.
   We have developed and proposed a number of suggestions and
   recommendations for improving the existing institutional environment and
   the system of state management, practical implementation of which should
   reduce the existing large gap in income levels as the main factor of
   living standards in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Recent studies find that Western-style professional nongovernmental
   organizations (NGOs) in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries are
   weak and unsustainable. Most of these NGOs developed strong dependency
   on foreign donors for funds, and did not develop local network of
   support. This study is conducted to understand the lack of effectiveness
   of NGOs in Kazakhstan and to test popular sentiments toward NGOs. The
   interview with local and foreign social science experts and public
   figures confirm that NGOs in Kazakhstan are weak and unsustainable. The
   explanations of institutional ineffectiveness lay in disconnect with
   local traditions, low visibility of NGOs, and unsupportive government.
   Survey of general population suggests that people in Kazakhstan know
   very little about NGOs and do not appreciate their utility. We explain
   the inability of civil society organizations to reach out to local
   people by cultural mismatch. By using the Hofstede national culture
   model (Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related
   values. Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications, 1984), we argue that local
   culture is in striking dissonance with the culture of donor countries,
   which created the NGO agenda in Kazakhstan.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Most of Kazakhstan's wealth hinges on oil rents, and the overall
   performance of the economy is closely linked to petroleum's price
   fluctuations. This study asks (1) why the institution of private
   ownership of oil proceeds has not led to a positive transformation of
   patron-client relations embedded in the country's energy sector, thus
   challenging the relevance of the `private ownership' narrative, and (2)
   why the collapse in the price of oil did not affect the stability and
   essential character of the regime in power. To answer these questions,
   the article examines two case studies: the privatization of the oil
   sector in the 1990s, and the post-2014 oil crisis. Thus the article
   problematizes important theories on oil-sector privatization and
   contributes to recent work on regime stability as it pertains to the
   resource curse. The analysis of the constitutive impact of oil wealth on
   Kazakh politics generates wider insights on the links between the power
   of informal networks and regime stability in petrostates through boom
   and bust cycles.},

Abstract = {International ratings confirm that Kazakhstan is a leader in Central
   Asia in addressing the causes of gender inequality; however, there are
   still significant gender differences in key areas. In particular, gender
   discrimination in the labor market is complex: when hiring or
   dismissing, while restricting access to certain professions and
   positions, in matters of promotion and career growth, when remuneration
   is paid for performing the same work, not related to differences in
   labor efficiency. Discrimination is especially sensitive in relation to
   pregnant women and women with young children. Discrimination continues
   with access to social measures for avoiding poverty and in the pension
   system. Further progress requires more strategically significant and
   focused actions to identify and bridge the remaining factors of systemic
   discrimination and gender gaps. In the article, we show the insufficient
   attention of the legal science of Kazakhstan to the problems of
   regulation of equality. We present the author's methodology for
   analyzing labor and social legislation from the perspective of
   regulating gender equality, consisting of several assessments:
   Kazakhstan's fulfillment of international obligations; implementation of
   the principle of nondiscrimination in labor and social legislation;
   administrative and judicial mechanisms to protect against discrimination
   based on sex; and opportunities for implementing best foreign and
   international practices for the regulation of equality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the novel Final Respects by Abdi-Jamil Nurpeisov
   from a postcolonial ecocritical perspective. Nurpeisov was one of the
   first Kazakh writers to discuss the decolonization of the environment
   and the ``process of self-apprehension{''} by writing about the tragedy
   of the Aral Sea, power relations between the center and periphery, and
   the interconnectivity of humans and the environment in the Soviet Union.
   Through the prism of a small fishing village, he shows the tragedy of a
   nation that has an impact on the entire world. The novel is thus a
   critique of anthropocentric policies imposed by Moscow on Kazakhstan and
   other Soviet republics. Throughout the text, Nurpeisov reiterates the
   connection between the local and the global on one hand, and human
   culture and the environment on the other.},

   the dynamics of their socio-political contexts and interconnections to

Abstract = {The research investigates woody species vegetation of roadside greenery
   of NurSultan/Karaganda (24 woody plants) and Nur-Sultan/Borovoye
   highways (16 woody plants). According to the species composition, more
   than 70\% of woody vegetation are dust, gas, and drought resistant, and
   about 60\% are salt tolerant. From 18 woody species planted on research
   plot of the university campus, 58\% of the woody plants have taken root.
   Likewise, in 2 species, a high survival rate of more than 85\% was
   observed (Acer negundo L. with 96.5\% and Ulmus pumila cv. jinye with
   85.5\%); in 7 species - satisfactory survival rate of 25-85\% (Pinus
   sylvestris with 79.4\%; Syringa oblata Lindl with 76\%; S. pubescens
   Turcz. with 74\%; Ulmus laevis Pall. with 65.5\%; Amorpha fruticosa Linn
   with 63.5\%;.laeagnus angustifolia L. with 62.5\%; Malus `Royalty' with
   39.5\%); in 5 species - low survival rate of less than 25\% (Catalpa
   ovata G. Don. with 17.5\%; Salix myrsinifolia Salibs. with 16.5\%;
   Fraxinus americana L. with 15.5\%; Syringa reticulata (Blume) H. Hara
   with 14.5\%; Amygdalus triloba (Lindl) Ricker with 10.5\%); 4 species
   have no survival (Fraxinus bungeana A.DC., Populus euphratica Oliv.,
   Haloxylon persicum Bunge, Tamarix laxa (Willd.). The soils of roadsides
   of Nur-Sultan/Karaganda, Nur-Sultan/Borovoye motorways showed very low
   and low levels of humus (< 4\%) and easily hydrolyzed nitrogen
   (<30mg/kg), characterized by significant variability of mobile P. The
   roadsides of Nur-Sultan/Karaganda and Nur-Sultan/Borovoye highways are
   characterized by an average and high content of exchange K, and weak
   salt content (from 0.04\% to 0.17\%). The salinity chemistry is
   sulfate-bicarbonate. NurSultan/Borovoye highway is characterized from
   mild to very strong sulfate and chloride salinization (from 0.15\% to
   0.85\%). The amount of toxic salts is 23.20\%. As a result, in order to
   optimize the sustainable ecological conditions of landscape and
   intercity systems in urbanized areas in dry- steppe regions, more
   effectively, it is highly recommended to use woody species with high
   survival percentage and growth performance.},

Abstract = {Background. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) has demonstrated good
   psychometric properties among different populations, but there is no
   known data on its validity among Russian-speaking medical students. The
   CBI-Student Survey focuses only on fatigue, but measures exhaustion in
   four different life domains: Personal Burnout (PB), Studies-Related
   Burnout (SRB), Colleague-Related Burnout (CRB), and Teacher-Related
   Burnout (TRB).
   Objective. To investigate the psychometric properties of the Russian
   version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (R-CBI-S).
   Design. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 771 medical
   students at Astana Medical University (Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan).
   Statistical analyses included test-retest reliability, internal
   consistency, item analysis, convergent and concurrent validity, and
   confirmatory factor analysis. Concurrent validity was evaluated by
   bivariate correlations of R-CBI-S with anxiety; depression, and
   satisfaction with the study.
   Results. Test-retest reliability showed an ICC of 0.81. All item-total
   correlations for the total scale were positive (range 0.31-0.76). The
   Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.94 (0.896 for PB, 0.884 for SRB,
   0.874 for CRB, and 0.926 for TRB). The Barlett's sphericity test result
   was significant (p < 0.001), and the KMO measure of sampling adequacy
   exceeded 0.947. Convergent validity analysis results: PB (AVE = 0.52,
   CR=0.87), SRB (AVE = 0.50, CR=0.87), CRB (AVE = 0.51, CR=0.86), TRB (AVE
   = 0.56, CR= 0.88). The R-CBI-S achieved good levels of goodness-of-fit
   indices (RMSEA = 0.0611; CFI = 0.940; TLI = 0.933).
   Conclusion. The test results indicated that the R-CBI-S scale appears to
   be a reliable and valid instrument. The R-CBI-S may be a useful tool in
   future research to identify burnout factors based on specific life
   domains for developing effective prevention measures among medical
   students.},

Title = {Kazakhstan's CO2 emissions in the post-Kyoto Protocol era: Production-
   and consumption-based analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {249},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol came to an end in 2012
   and more developing countries began to participate in the new phase of
   world carbon emission reduction. Kazakhstan is an important energy
   export country and a pivot of the ``Belt and Road Initiative{''} (BRI).
   Despite its emissions are relatively small compared with huge emitters
   such as China and the US, Kazakhstan also faces great pressure in terms
   of CO2 emission reduction and green development. Accurately accounting
   CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan from both production and consumption
   perspectives is the first step for further emissions control actions.
   This paper constructs production-based CO2 emission inventories for
   Kazakhstan from 2012 to 2016, and then further analyses the
   demand-driven emissions within the domestic market and international
   trade (exports and imports) using environmentally extended input-output
   analysis. The production-based inventory includes 43 energy products and
   30 sectors to provide detailed data for CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan. The
   consumption-based accounting results showed that certain sectors like
   construction drive more emissions and that the fuel consumption in
   different sectors varies. Furthermore, Russia and China are major
   consumers of Kazakhstan's energy and associated emissions, with the
   construction sector playing the most important role in it. The results
   suggested that both technology and policy actions should be taken into
   account to reduce CO2 emissions and that the BRI is also a good chance
   for Kazakhstan to develop a ``Green Economy{''}.},

   region. The significance of geopolitical considerations and the
   resulting pragmatism of Kazakhstan's leadership only allow a limited
   role for national identity and internal political dynamics in the making

Abstract = {In the transition from the raw material orientation of the economy to
   industrial development, an increase in innovative activity is of great
   importance. Diffusion of innovation and the knowledge spillovers between
   regions can play an active role in this. To stimulate innovative
   activity, which plays a decisive role in the transition from the raw
   material orientation of the economy to industrial development, diffusion
   of innovations and the knowledge spillovers between regions are
   important. The flows of technological innovations, stimulating the
   processes of creating new products and technologies, contribute to
   increasing the rate of regional economic growth.
   The purpose of the study is to quantify the impact of costs on R\&D and
   technological innovation, their flows in space on the economic growth of
   the regions of Kazakhstan.
   The authors verified the models of endogenous growth for Kazakhstan,
   built a social filter, and calculated two specifications of the
   econometric model with fixed effects. Model calculations confirmed the
   hypothesis about the positive impact of technological innovation costs
   on regional economic growth rates. At the same time, the regions need to
   pursue their own innovation policy in order to maintain absorption
   capacity, which is a prerequisite for an effective flow of knowledge.
   The results of the study can be used by public authorities in the
   formation of the regional innovation policy of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Measuring Social Desirability in Collectivist Countries: A Psychometric
   Study in a Representative Sample From Kazakhstan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Social desirability bias (SDB) is a pervasive measurement challenge in
   the social sciences and survey research. More clarity is needed to
   understand the performance of social desirability scales in diverse
   groups, contexts, and cultures. The present study aims to contribute to
   the international literature on social desirability measurement by
   examining the psychometric performance of a short version of the
   Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS) in a nationally
   representative sample of teachers in Kazakhstan. A total of 2,461
   Kazakhstani teachers completed the MCSDS - Form C in their language of
   choice (i.e., Russian or Kazakh). The results failed to support the
   theoretical unidimensionality of the original scale. Instead, the
   results of Random Intercept Item Factor Analysis model suggest that the
   scale answers depend more on the method factor rather than the
   substantial factor that represents SDB. In addition, an alternative
   explanation indicates that the scale seems better suited to measuring
   two SDB correlated factors: attribution and denial. Internal consistency
   coefficients demonstrated unsatisfactory reliability scores for the two
   factors. The Kazakhstani version of the MCSDS - Form C was invariant
   across geographic location (i.e., urban vs. rural), language (i.e.,
   Kazakh vs. Russian), and partially across age groups. However, no
   measurement invariance was demonstrated for gender. Despite these
   limitations, the analysis of the Kazakhstani version of the MCSDS - Form
   C presented in this study constitutes a first step in facilitating
   further research and measurement of SDB in post-Soviet Kazakhstan and
   other collectivist countries.},

Abstract = {The study investigates asymmetries in energy use, real output growth,
   FDI, energy intensity and CO2 emission in Kazakhstan. The linear ARDL
   approach of Pesaran et al. (2001.Journal of Applied Econometrics, 16(3),
   289-326) was adopted following Aslan (2014.Energy Sources,Part
   B:Economics,Planning,and Policy,9, 25-31) to examine the causality
   between energy use and real output within a simple model. Subsequently,
   in line with Ndoricmpa (2017.Energy,125, 543-551), the Shin et al.
   (2014.Festschrift in honour of Peter Schmidt. New York, NY: Springer
   Science \& Business Media) non-linear ARDL asymmetric specification was
   followed to analyse the dynamic asymmetries amongst the estimated
   variables-in an extended model. Annual time series data expressed in
   natural logarithm from 1992 to 2016 was utilized for the study. ARDL
   model established a long-run relationship between energy use and real
   output in Kazakhstan. The modified Granger causality test confirms
   uni-directional causality from real output to energy use-suggestive that
   energy conservation hypothesis is supported. In the estimated NARDL
   model, no empirical evidence exist yet-in support of the `pollution
   haven' hypothesis and energy-related CO2 induced emission in Kazakhstan
   whereas asymmetry exists in energy intensity.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many governments of both resource-rich and resource-poor countries have
   recently started to use local content policies as a tool in their
   industrial policies. However, careless implementation of local content
   policies can lead to corrupt practices and threaten firm performance.
   Using the World Bank Enterprise Survey of 933 Kazakhstani firms in 2009
   and 2013, we study the effect of corruption on employment and sales
   growth and the role that explicit local content policy plays in this
   relationship. Our findings demonstrate that corruption has ``a greasing
   the wheels effects{''}, facilitating employment growth and sales growth
   in Kazakhstani firms. In case of securing a government contract,
   corruption will have a larger effect on sales growth than on job growth.
   This study provides insights and implications for contract law and
   industrial policy in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Aytis is a central component of Kazakh oral literature. It is a duelling
   performance of improvised oral poetry between two aqins (poets, or
   bards) accompanying themselves on the dombra, a two-stringed plucked
   instrument. This article analyses contending issues in a transnational
   aytis between Chinese and Kazakhstani aqins, and explores how gender
   plays into the complex interplay of transnational identity politics,
   nationalism, performer positionality, and the preservation of intangible
   cultural heritage. This article argues that, though minority actors are
   subject to state-patronized national projects and the gender paradigms
   those projects entail, they can also obtain empowerment from performing
   tradition as a way to legitimize their status as culture producers and
   flexible citizens. Situated as the guardians of a constructed gender
   balance in society, women performers of oral tradition occasionally find
   themselves with opportunities to transgress the boundaries of their
   national and gender norms.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {462-487},
Abstract = {This essay explores the historical geographic antecedents of migration
   decisions among Koreans and Germans in Kazakhstan as evidence of the
   importance of space-time approaches to socio-political phenomena. Both
   groups came to Central Asia under similar circumstances as `punished
   peoples' but reacted very differently to Kazakhstan's independence.
   Koreans have largely opted to remain in Kazakhstan and re-imagine
   themselves as hybrid members of the Korean diaspora and the Kazakhstani
   civic nation. The majority of Germans, by contrast, have opted to
   migrate to Germany and abandon Kazakhstan. I argue that despite
   significant similarities in their historical geographic experiences
   within Tsarist Russia and the USSR, the unique spatio-temporal
   biographies of each group have configured their respective homeland
   conceptions differently. Contingency, rather than some a priori pattern
   of territorialisation, is clearly evident in each group's receptivity to
   migration possibilities.},

Abstract = {The formulation of policies, which can promote multiple use of forests
   in mountain regions, requires rigorous methods and approaches, based oil
   established theories. A relevant conceptual framework is the `mixed
   model', which is based oil both rationalist and communicative action
   theories. With Such a model, based on the policy cycle theory, the
   precision of multipurpose forestry objectives and means remains as the
   main task of the public authority (especially the forest service), but
   this call only result from discussions with various stakeholders in both
   public and private sectors, at central and local levels. The model works
   through a permanent confrontation between owners' and users' interests,
   expressed by representatives involved in policy formulation. Such a
   negotiation approach is used for analysing the present situation and
   issues (strong and weak points), for defining and structuring various
   objectives of the policy, as well as for defining different strategies
   and measures to be implemented to achieve those objectives. Further
   discussions of different positions among the participants finally lead
   to negotiated common solutions for future policy. Such a method is
   particularly adapted to public decision-making in mountain forests,
   where demands from various stakeholders are numerous and problems
   urgently need to be solved. The mixed model necessarily brings
   compromises between competitive or complementary social needs and
   interests, and automatically promotes multifunctional forestry
   management schemes and measures. However, that does not mean an easy
   implementation of such a conceptual frame. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the context of global
   migration. From a migration perspective, the pandemic is a source of
   insecurities that challenge migrants, their livelihoods and migration
   governance. Meanwhile, curtailment in movement has led to economic
   decline affecting labour markets. For migrant origin and hosting
   countries, this poses multidimensional development challenges. Analysis
   from March to August 2020 of China, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,
   Morocco, Nepal and Thailand highlights the varying ways in which they
   are all severely affected by the disruptions in migration, suggesting a
   potentially emerging complex situation in migration patterns and
   pathways. The disruptions in migration and remittances have had a
   profound impact on migrants and migrant-sending households. The
   uncertainty of migration returning to pre-pandemic levels and the
   potential of lasting consequences on migrants and migration patterns and
   pathways, suggests a future of greater risk and exploitation, and a
   wider gap between formal and informal migration. This paper calls for
   greater mobility cooperation between countries and suggests
   strengthening mobility migration frameworks and policies for safer
   migration and for the rights of migrants.},

Abstract = {This article is on early childhood teacher education in Tajikistan. It
   is contextualized by the collapse of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan's
   rebirth in 1992, followed by Tajikistan's immediate spiral into a
   five-year civil war. Established as a presidential republic and having
   existed for fewer than 25 years as war-free, Tajikistan has made
   recovery efforts toward establishing stability and developing
   government, military, business, health, and education. One aspect of
   Tajikistan's rapid growth efforts is early childhood education,
   specifically, to provide early childhood programs aligned with
   alternative early childhood development (ECD) models (i.e., alternative
   to the teacher-centered Soviet-era kindergarten programs). With limited
   wealth and lack of a developed infrastructure, Tajikistan's early
   education leaders work diligently on alternative models with a variety
   of funding partners. Building on this foundation, the authors shared
   collaborative, culturally responsive, early childhood teacher training
   initiatives in two diverse Tajik cities along the historic silk trade
   route. Reflections on how the trainings were delivered and received
   provide teacher educators, particularly in international settings,
   insights into strategies that build upon the history while sharing
   current practices.},

Abstract = {This study discusses the features of the transition from the traditional
   assessment system to the criteria-based assessment in schools of
   Kazakhstan. The use of criterion assessment in schools in Kazakhstan
   contributes to the crowding out of traditional methods of assessment and
   leads to a new vision of the methods and technologies of the system for
   evaluating educational achievements. In connection with the
   modernization of Kazakhstan's education, significant changes are
   occurring in the control and assessment activities of Kazakhstan
   schools, its goals, content, and technologies are changing. The problem
   of assessment activity is one of the most urgent problems both in
   pedagogical theory and in pedagogical practice. This study presents the
   results of empirical studies and the features of the transition to a new
   criteria-based assessment system for Kazakhstan. According to the
   results of the study, the problem of the need for professional training
   of future primary school teachers for the criteria-based assessment
   system was revealed. Results also showed that there are difficulties of
   applying criteria-based assessment in the practice of primary school
   teachers. The question of what professional knowledge, skills, and
   abilities an elementary school teacher must possess to successfully
   perform the monitoring and evaluation function was investigated.
   Particular attention is paid to the study of the influence of
   criteria-based assessment on learning motivation in primary school.},

Abstract = {This research is defined as a study regarding on structured and
   systematized of existing literature review of the intersection between
   intellectual property management, management and technology transfer
   offices (TTOs). It takes a deeper look at requirements within
   universities, scientific institutions and the business environment
   should be interconnected with each other. The literature review shows
   that TTOs have control over the process of knowledge transfer and they
   have contributed to improving the efficiency of the use of production
   and human resources. In this paper, authors proposed the methodological
   tools based on methodology model, which identified success factors for
   using project management in TTO between two countries - Kazakhstan and
   Spain. Further, we used methodology is focused on solving the problems
   of quantitative analysis based on the use of primary data, which allowed
   us to reach a huge number of respondents without any restrictions, and
   secondary data from statistical database. Findings and results are
   summarized at the end of article show that Kazakhstan is following the
   path of the Spanish experience. However, Kazakhstan can become more
   successful in commercializing scientific technologies and transferring
   knowledge and technologies. In turn, Spain can use the data from our
   analysis to work on barriers and improve the activities of TTOs.},

Abstract = {Since its privatization in 1995, Kazakhstan's largest steel mill has
   been in a restructuring process characterized by workforce reduction,
   augmented pressure on remaining jobs and labour conflict over wages,
   work conditions and corporate social responsibility. In 2013, in an
   attempt to re-establish harmonious relationships with workers,
   management invited the mill's former labour aristocracy to join a newly
   established veterans' council, a forum resembling traditional aksakal
   councils, to discuss the company's difficult situation. In the context
   of a banquet in honour of the veterans, tradition became the contested
   terrain over which labour and capital struggled to endorse their own
   visions of the industrial future. As corporate capitalist visions of
   efficiency and professionalism, ethno-national concerns for harmony and
   stability, and practices rooted in the Soviet labour legacy clash,
   tradition is staged by actors as a practice which can either affirm or
   challenge industrial leadership in a labour conflict.},

Abstract = {The rapid loss of small glaciers worldwide might result in mountain
   villages changing from having plenty of water during the growing season,
   to facing a scarcity even in scenarios with adaptation. Climate-change
   effects might cause the need for significant changes in rural mountain
   economies that currently rely on irrigated agriculture, pastoralism and
   labor migration. Previous research mainly focuses on geophysical aspects
   and little is known about the local ability to understand climate-change
   indicators or local collective adaptive capacity. A 2010 participatory
   case study in the Zerafshan Range, Tajikistan, disclosed a local lack of
   awareness of climate change and its consequences. We present a social
   learning method based on scenarios and visualization. The process
   exposed a remarkable potential for comprehensive adaptation, including
   in water harvesting, choice of crops and livestock, environmental
   enhancement, skills and conflict management. We recommend the approach
   as a model to promote local collective adaptive capacity development.
   The case study revealed high risks of massive out-migration from
   mountain villages if adaptation starts too late: countries with a high
   proportion of mountain agriculture might see significant losses of
   agricultural area, a reduction in food production and an increase in
   conflicts in areas where immigration occurs.},

   peacebuilding at either the state or international scale. Correcting
   that trend, this article illuminates the role of women peacebuilders in
   the post-conflict city of Osh. Based on ethnographic research conducted
   in 2016, it argues that women have a hitherto overlooked but nonetheless
   important `invisible' role in peacebuilding.},

Title = {A bi-level chance-constrained programming method for quantifying the
   effectiveness of water-trading to water-food-ecology nexus in Amu Darya
   River basin of Central Asia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},

Abstract = {Issues of water scarcity, food crisis, and ecological degradation pose
   great challenges to the sustainable development of Central Asia. In this
   study, a bi-level chance-constrained programming (BCCP) method is
   developed for planning water-food-ecology (WFE) nexus system of the Amu
   Darya River basin, where the efficiency of water-trading mechanism and
   the impact of uncertain water-availability are examined. This is the
   first attempt for planning WFE nexus system by incorporating
   chance-constrained programming (CCP) within a bi-level optimization
   framework. BCCP can reflect the risk of violating probabilistic
   constraint under uncertainty as well as balance the tradeoff between
   two-level decision makers in the WFE nexus system. Under trading scheme,
   multiple scenarios in association with different food demand,
   ecological-water requirement, and water availability are examined. Major
   findings are: (i) compared with that under non-trading, system benefits
   would increase {[}3.9, 20.4]\% under trading scenarios, disclosing that
   water trading is an effective mechanism for the study basin; (ii) when
   food demand increases 10.5\%, water allocated to ecological use would
   decrease {[}0.9, 2.7]\% under all scenarios, revealing that agriculture
   can squeeze ecological water; (iii) both system benefit and water
   allocation would increase with p level, implying there is a tradeoff
   between system benefit and system-failure risk. These findings can gain
   insight into the interaction between two-level stakeholders and
   objectives as well as provide decision support for WFE nexus synergetic
   management.},

Abstract = {The physical format of office configuration has advanced to mirror the
   intricacy of modern work and the transitory nature of contemporary
   employment. Drawing on the social exchange theory, this study examines
   the effect of office design and psychological empowerment on the
   relationship between transformational leadership and employee
   organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB). A total of 216 subordinates
   and 49 supervisors completed questionnaire items from ten organizations
   in Uzbekistan. The survey was conducted in two waves and designed to
   have multi-source respondents. Confirmatory factor analysis was run to
   examine the discriminant validity of our measurement model. Ordinary
   least square regression-based analysis was used to analyze direct and
   interaction effects, and then it was followed by bootstrapping tests to
   identify mediation effects. Results reveal that transformational
   leadership is significantly related to psychological empowerment, and
   that psychological empowerment mediates the relationship between
   transformational leadership and OCB. Furthermore, the relationship
   between psychological empowerment and OCB is stronger in an open-plan
   office type. This study confirms that transformational leaders are adept
   at bringing out the best in their followers, influencing their OCB by
   increasing intrinsic motivation (psychological empowerment). Office
   type-specifically, open-plan offices-will intensify employee willingness
   to engage in extra-role behaviour.},

Abstract = {The advantages of a nexus approach in addressing complex environmental
   challenges are becoming increasingly clear. In Central Asia, however,
   the nexus between water-food-energy has not received adequate attention,
   as the very few studies that have been conducted fell short of
   quantifying nexus trade-offs and benefits at a practical, small scale.
   This paper applies a quantitative accounting method to assess water and
   energy use intensity in irrigated areas of the Karshi Steppe of Central
   Asia that are supplied by pumping water uphill (lift-irrigated) from the
   underlying river. The results indicated that the potential water and
   energy savings as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions
   could be achieved by applying an optimal planning deficit irrigation
   schedule simulated using CROPWAT 8. Some 575 MCM (million cubic metres)
   of water and 259 GWh of electricity can be saved, while the CO2

Abstract = {In the last decade, several studies have been devoted to the analysis of
   the EU's support to civil society abroad, but only recently has
   scholarly attention turned to Central Asia. Most of the research in this
   field has adopted a macro-level perspective, concerned with the supply
   side of external democratization, and has examined external assistance
   to civil society in terms of democratization ideal types and typologies.
   The main contribution of this study consists of a meso-level analysis of
   the outcomes of the EU's support to civil society in terms of production
   of social capital, conceived as the raw material of civil society
   itself. More precisely, the article evaluates the first wave of grants
   awarded to civil society organizations in Kazakhstan as part of two EU
   funding schemes-the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights
   and the Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development. The
   article sheds new light on the use of social capital and its two
   dimensions-structural and cognitive-as heuristic tools for evaluating
   civil society support programs.},

Abstract = {The management of municipal solid waste in the Republic of Kazakhstan is
   still in its infancy. This situation poses a potential threat to the
   environment and public health and, therefore, it is necessary to
   introduce improved management schemes in the country. In this study, the
   life cycle assessment methodology was followed to evaluate the potential
   environmental benefits of implementing alternative management schemes
   based on low-waste generation and renewable energy production. The
   current situation of the capital city Astana was considered as the base
   case. Environmental results showed that air emissions in terms of
   landfill gases are the major contributor to climate change impacts,
   while landfill disposal of the non-recovered fraction of recyclable
   materials was responsible for the highest impacts in the other
   categories (especially land use). However, the reuse of recycled
   materials largely offsets the related environmental burdens, along with
   energy generation. In comparative terms, it was demonstrated that the
   proposed waste management scenarios are more environmentally friendly
   than current practices (S0), mainly owing to the credits associated with
   the valorisation of renewable energy (S2) and recovered materials (S3).
   Consequently, the evaluation showed that greater efforts should be made
   to exploit the energy potential of organic fraction, together with
   higher recycling rates, to move towards lower environmental impacts
   associated with municipal solid waste management.},

Abstract = {The political, economic and sociocultural changes that took place after
   the break-up of the USSR continue to impact the linguistic landscape of
   Kazakhstan. The historical linkages to the Russian Empire and then the
   USSR, both of which were characterized by policies of Russification,
   have resulted in the existence of a highly multilingual society that
   features widespread bilingualism in Kazakh and Russian. The on-going
   bilingualism in Kazakhstan continues to significantly affect the growth
   rate of the national consciousness and the identity of Kazakh society.
   The focus of the study reported in this article was to understand how
   the complex pattern of language planning programs is reflected in the
   linguistic landscape of Kazakhstan and particularly in Astana, the new
   capital city, by examining how visual public signs (ergonyms) indicate
   the heterogeneous characteristics of the society and how different
   agencies work on the problems of language use and attitudes in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cotton export substantially contributes to Uzbekistan's economy. To
   produce cotton, the state imposes output targets on farmers which
   results in intensified cotton production practices, and consequently in
   land degradation. Improving degraded croplands via afforestation is an
   option explored through research experiments in the region, yet is
   currently not practiced by farmers. Using the example of the Amu Darya
   River lowlands of Uzbekistan, we analyze afforestation and its
   implementation constraints, by developing a coevolutionary
   socio-ecological systems framework that leans on evolutionary economics
   and evolutionary governance theories. Our study shows that farmers'
   perceptions and rationalities, in close association with governance
   configurations of actors, institutions and knowledges, make them
   unreceptive towards afforestation. Altering relations between
   agricultural institutions and actors that are currently present in the
   cotton-centric configuration is difficult given the path-, inter- and
   goal dependencies. To change rural sustainable development paths, we
   conclude that the adoption of innovations requires a tailoring of
   knowledge and technology fitting local situation, as well as the
   reassembling of relations between actors, institutions and knowledge.},

   participants included in the experimental group received additional
   education and training on dental plaque removal using the Qscan device.
   The accumulated levels of plaque were assessed in all participants, who
   also completed questionnaires about their oral health status, oral
   health knowledge, attitude, and behavior during an 8-week period.
   Results: There were statistically significant improvements in the
   experimental group compared to the control group in the plaque index
   (0.46 vs 0.07,p <. 05), oral health knowledge (19.4 vs 28.8, p <. 05),
   attitude (16.7 vs 20.2, p <. 05), and behavior (19.9 vs 30.5, p <. 05).
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that an oral health education
   program based on the use of QLF technology could be useful for improving
   the oral hygiene status and oral health literacy of adolescents in
   Uzbekistan.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Unprecedented communication features of social media noticeably
   reinforce the active role of consumers in the value co-creation (VCC) of
   offline and online brands including social media. From the consumer
   perspective, this study examines a contribution of VCC behavior to
   consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) and consequent intention to use
   social media based on Instagram as the most popular platform in
   Kazakhstan. Methodology: A web-based survey provided data from 550
   Instagram users in Almaty city. Empirical analysis includes testing
   statistical assumptions using SPSS 23, conducting confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) using Warp PLS
   7.0. Findings: With the result of this study investigation, the paper
   develops the model that explains the effect of VCC on continuous usage
   intention to use social media through CBBE comprising brand
   associations, brand loyalty and brand perceived quality. Originality:
   Even though the importance of social media in the brand VCC process is
   widely recognized, a brand equity view of social media brands with
   users' participation is under-investigated. However, brand equity's
   importance for firm sustainability in terms of long-term business
   strategy is indisputable. This research enhances brand equity theory and
   VCC concept with the empirical data within the modern social media
   context. Practical implications: Owners and managers of social media
   brands can use the conceptual model to grow, maintain and assess their
   brands' equities through their marketing efforts on the consumer
   motivation for brand VCC activities driving continuous usage of the
   brands.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The emotional intelligence (El) model is widely used in
   pedagogy, management and other spheres as a useful concept with great
   potential for application. At the same time, there are significant
   differences in the traits of EI in different social groups, in
   particular, in different countries, which are just beginning to be
   studied. To date, there is a significant gap in the research literature
   on cross-cultural research in the field of EI, especially in the area of
   measuring its performance. This work is devoted to the study of the
   quantitative aspects of the differences in the traits of EI between
   teachers of higher educational institutions in Kazakhstan and Russia.
   Design/methodology/approach - For the study, 700 participants from two
   countries were involved, 350 people from each with an approximately
   equal distribution by gender and age. Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher
   transformation were used for statistical analysis of the results of the
   N. Hall test for teachers from two countries.
   Findings - As a result of assessing the level of EI by the method of N.
   Hall, significant differences were found in the manifestation of various
   scales of EI in representatives of these two groups (Fisher's
   transformation relative to the scales: ``emotional awareness{''} was
   f{*}em = 5.466).
   Originality/value - The practical value of the study lies in the
   discovery of a methodology for determining the difference in the traits
   of EI, which can be used in the correction of teaching methods,
   personnel management in higher educational institutions and in the
   formation of educational teams.},

   had to be kept in proportion.... Prosecutors had called for 18 months in
   prison for assaulting a public official. The three judges said Tarel
   should be given 18 months, with 14 months of the sentence suspended. His
   four months in jail will start immediately but the rest will only be

Abstract = {The use of hydraulic models for carrying out flood simulations is a
   common practice globally. The current study used HEC-RAS (2D) in order
   to simulate different flood scenarios on the River Yesil (Ishim).
   Comparison of different mesh sizes (25, 50 and 75 m) indicated no
   significant difference in model performance. However, a significant
   difference was observed in simulation time. In addition, the inclusion
   of breaklines showed that there was a slight improvement in model
   performance and a shortening of the simulation time. Sensitivity
   analysis and the consequent manual calibration of sensitive parameters
   resulted in a slight improvement (an increase in the model accuracy from
   58.4\% for uncalibrated to 59.7\% for calibrated). Following the
   simulations inundation maps for 10-, 20- and 100-year flood events were
   obtained. Hazard classification of the flood extents generated indicated
   that the settlements of Zhibek Zholy and Arnasay were flooded in all the
   simulated events. Volgodonovka village experienced flooding when a
   100-year flood event was simulated. On the other hand, settlement No. 42
   did not experience any flooding in any of the scenarios. The model
   results also demonstrate that the Counter-Regulator was not overtopped
   in the event of the 100-year hydrograph.},

Abstract = {The reality of globalization declines the frontiers for cross border

   international businesses which emphasis nationalistic sentiments, pride
   and the rejection of any product or idea that is made in another country
   without any rationale reasoning. Thus, this study is aimed at
   researching the subject of consumer ethnocentrism in the Central Asian
   Turkish Republic of Kazakhstan. The results indicate that there is not a
   strong relation between ethnocentric perceptions and product necessity
   in Kazakhstan. Also, sub-dimensions of ethnocentrism have different
   correlation levels with each imported products. In addition, religious

Abstract = {Despite the important International Political Economy (IPE) scholarship
   on the impact of neoliberal marketisation on women in the Global South,
   the linkages with reproductive and informal work are often neglected, as
   is its interaction with multi-level varieties of patriarchy. Developing
   a theoretical framework merging social reproduction theory and varieties
   of gender regimes, this article examines how women navigate market and
   non-market pressures during the ongoing processes of Uzbek agrarian
   marketisation. By applying the concept of domestic and public patriarchy
   to analyse the gendered practices of food production and reproduction in
   Uzbekistan, the article unpacks the household-led and state-led forms of
   dispossession and exploitation of women's work in everyday life and
   investigates why women's position has not improved as a result of
   marketisation. The paper contributes to feminist IPE in two ways. By
   bringing together two strands of gender theories, it explores the link
   between the institutional and cultural connotation and the economic
   `valuation' of women's work. Along these lines, it examines the
   weaknesses of the policy solutions proposed by the neoliberal
   development governance in the Global South.},

   MINERAL MINING IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN},
Journal = {EURASIAN MINING},
Year = {2022},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-45},
Abstract = {The methods and economic parameters of mineral mining are interrelated
   with the applied technological, structural and organizational solutions.
   The parameters of individual ore bodies, their occurrence conditions and
   the totality of natural ore-forming processes govern these engineering
   solutions.
   Considering the relationship between such concepts as the integrity,
   structures and com-ponents of a subsoil use system, the basic principles
   defining a set of production processes for extracting minerals (or
   commercial component) from the subsoil are formulated. Due to the
   improvement of tools and technology, the scopes of the synonymic
   ``mineral mining{''} and ``min-eral production{''} concepts expanded.
   The technological evolution was accompanied by fun-damental
   clarifications and new understanding of the key concepts in scientific
   cognition and production management. The scientific relevance of the set
   of systemic principles rested on their application as a practical guide
   in mining.
   The key definitions included the validated series of the components and
   their contents. The proposed formulations have a significant weight both
   in science and technology as they pro-vide more economically efficient
   and safe level of organization of underground mining with the
   system-founded and fool-proof selection of mining methods.},

Abstract = {This article explores issues of citizenship and belonging associated
   with post-Soviet Kazakhstan's repatriation programme. Beginning in 1991,
   Kazakhstan financed the resettlement of over 944,000 diasporic Kazakhs
   from nearly a dozen countries, including Mongolia, and encouraged
   repatriates to become naturalised citizens. Using the concept of
   `privileged exclusion', this article argues that repatriated Kazakhs
   from Mongolia belong due to their knowledge of Kazakh language and
   traditions yet, at the same time, do not belong due to their lack of
   linguistic fluency in Russian, the absence of a shared Soviet
   experience, and limited comfort with the `cosmopolitan' lifestyle that
   characterises the new elite in this post-Soviet context.},

   Envelope in Different Climatic Zones of Kazakhstan},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the residential sector of Kazakhstan accounts for about 30\%
   of the total energy consumption. Therefore, it is essential to analyze
   the energy estimation model for residential buildings in Kazakhstan so
   as to reduce energy consumption. This research is aimed to develop the
   Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) based Building Energy Simulation
   Model (BESM) for the reduction of energy consumption through the
   envelope of residential buildings in seven cities of Kazakhstan. A brute
   force optimization method was adopted to obtain the optimal envelope
   configuration varying window-to-wall ratio (WWR), the angle of a pitched
   roof, the depth of the overhang shading system, the thermal
   conductivity, and the thicknesses of wall composition materials. In
   addition, orientation-related analyses of the optimized cases were
   conducted. Finally, the economic evaluation of the base and optimized
   cases were presented. The results showed that an average energy
   reduction for heating was 6156.8 kWh, while for cooling it was almost
   1912.17 kWh. The heating and cooling energy savings were 16.59\% and
   16.69\%, respectively. The frontage of the building model directed
   towards the south in the cold season and north in the hot season
   demonstrated around 21\% and 32\% of energy reduction, respectively. The
   energy cost savings varied between 9657 to 119,221 x20b8; for heating,
   9622 to 36,088 x20b8; for cooling.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study described in this paper is aimed at identifying
   the environmental situation of the agroecosystem and studying the impact
   of resource-saving technology methods for the cultivation of oilseed
   rapeseed, ensuring sustainability and productivity of the agroecosystem
   during environmental monitoring. The object of the study was spring
   rapeseed of the Maily variety. Experimental studies were carried out
   using the generally accepted classical techniques, such as experiment
   and observation, in the form of a multifactorial field experiment. A
   two-factor field experiment was laid out by the split plots method and
   based on the methodology for conducting field experiments with oilseeds.
   The results of the study were obtained using the methods of a
   soil-protective agriculture system based on the principles of soil
   protection technology. The studied minimal tillage provides a reduction
   in the amount of mechanical impact on the soil, restoration and
   preservation of soil fertility, improvement of moisture supply by
   leaving the plant stubble and scattering chopped straw after harvesting
   the previous crop, and replacing deep moldboard tillage with shallow
   flat-cut tillage. On the basis of the obtained study results, it was
   proven that the replacement of energy-intensive moldboard tillage with
   shallow flat-cut tillage (mini-till), ensuring the rational use of soil
   resources and resource-energy conservation, was feasible. The
   reconstructed parameters of agrophysical factors of soil fertility were
   determined, such as density, aggregate composition, and the structure
   and water resistance of soil aggregates, which ensured the
   sustainability of the environmental situation of the agroecosystem. It
   has been established that the soil protection methods of resource-saving
   rapeseed cultivation technology mitigate the risk and optimize the
   conditions for the growth and development of crops, where productivity
   increases to 21.3\%, and also provide 29.3 thousand tenges/ha of
   additional income from each hectare with an increase in the
   profitability of rapeseed cultivation to 97\% and 108\% under the
   conditions of South-East Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify problems that impede the
   investment activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
   the Republic of Kazakhstan, as well as to study the recommendations of
   the leading representatives in the business community regarding the
   activities of the authorities in creating a favorable investment
   climate. Expert interviews with the Kazakhstan's entrepreneurs,
   representatives of Akimats, and representatives of the scientific
   community have been conducted during the study. The results of the
   expert survey allow to conclude that the Republic of Kazakhstan has
   developed a rather favorable investment climate in general, and the
   authorities have done significant work to create conditions for business
   development. However, according to the expert review, some problems in
   the implementation of investment projects by SMEs still remain.
   According to the experts, the most significant problems include the
   underdeveloped transport and logistics infrastructure, the lack of
   available production and office space, and difficulties with registering
   land, attracting foreign labor, as well as obtaining various permits
   required for doing business. As a result of the study, the
   recommendations have been made for eliminating the barriers that hinder
   the creation of a favorable investment climate and the successful
   development of SMEs in the Republic of Kazakhstan. According to the
   experts, the attention should be focused on creating and developing
   ready-made platforms for doing business for investors, improving
   transport and logistics infrastructure, speeding up the state property
   privatization, etc.},

Title = {Assessing the Market Risk on the Government Debt of Kazakhstan and
   Bulgaria in Conditions of Turbulence},
Journal = {RISKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The purpose of this publication is to quantify and compare the market
   risk on the external government debt of Kazakhstan and Bulgaria in the
   conditions of COVID-19, the emerging energy crisis, and the coup attempt
   in the first country. In particular, the authors invest the market risk
   of sovereign bonds issued on global financial markets. Market risk is
   assessed both as a single issue and at a portfolio level using the
   Value-at-risk approach. Sixteen samples with historical observations of
   all issues of Kazakhstan's and Bulgarian Sovereign Bonds issued on the
   international financial markets were formed. The duration method was
   used in the calculation of Delta normal bond VaR and CVaR. It was found
   that with the same credit rating, similar portfolio duration levels,
   similar GDP per capita, Debt (\% of GDP), and Debt Per Capita, the
   market risk on their portfolio differed significantly. The comparison of
   risk levels between the two portfolios was made by six indicators-two
   indicators measuring linearly the sensitivity of bond prices to changes
   in market interest rates (Weighted average Macaulay duration and
   Weighted average modified duration) and four downside indicators
   (Undiversified VaR, Diversified VaR, Undiversified CVaR, amd Diversified
   CVaR). The return/risk performance of both portfolios was assessed by
   the Sharpe ratio in three variants (SR Undiversified VaR, SR Diversified
   VaR, and SR Diversified CVaR). When evaluating the bond portfolio VaR
   and CVaR, a practical version of the Duration method was proposed, which
   allows the use of an unlimited number of assets, taking into account the
   correlations between yield returns and historical price volatility.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian leaders face a dilemma in choosing whether to fund higher
   education: risk promoting educated students who are more likely to
   protest, or increase human capital and promote economic growth? We argue
   that autocrats invest in higher education to gain the support of those

   Panel data analysis confirms this hypothesis, but offers limited insight
   into why. We examine the Kazakh case to better understand the causal
   mechanisms at play. The evidence is strongly suggestive that higher
   education can be an important part of the authoritarian toolbox.},

Title = {Informal politics and the uncertain context of transition: revisiting
   early stage non-democratic development in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},
Abstract = {This article examines the genesis and influence of informal politics on
   non-democratic outcomes in Central Asia. As opposed to current
   scholarship which explains the emergence of informal politics as a
   result of kinship-based cultural legacies, this work uses the broader
   analytical framework of neopatrimonialism to understand informal
   political phenomena while emphasizing the role of uncertainty and
   contingent actor choice in explaining its appearance. The article also
   assesses how informal political behaviour (patronage and patron-client
   relations) was used to consolidate authoritarianism. Using Kazakhstan's
   (1990-95) early transition period as a case study this article notes how
   three processes central to transition (institutional conflict, emerging
   pluralism, and electoral competition) elicited a degree of uncertainty
   which destabilized prior institutional equilibrium. The president of
   Kazakhstan applied informal forms of politics to manage this uncertainty
   to re-assert his power and consolidate his personal authoritarian rule
   at the expense of emerging democratic institutions. The article
   illustrates how the uncertain and contingent process of transition is
   instrumental to the emergence of informal politics and the durability of
   authoritarianism in Kazakhstan, and that informal political relations
   and behaviour are important to understanding non-democratic and
   democratic paths in former Soviet states.},

Title = {Reverse flow in academic mobility from core to periphery: motivations of
   international faculty working in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {369-386},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Through expanding flows of labor and knowledge on a global scale,
   academics are increasingly mobile as higher education institutions
   compete for talent that transcends borders. However, talent often flows
   from the periphery to the core as scholars seek out employment in
   recognized institutions of higher learning in developed economies. This
   study examines faculty mobility in a reverse direction: from the core to
   Kazakhstan, the largest country in Central Asia. What factors persuade
   faculty members to relocate to Kazakhstan for full-time employment? What
   types of individuals pursue this relocation? Through interviews with
   international faculty members based in Kazakhstan, the study identifies
   push factors that trigger departure from one's previous country of
   residence: job market, unsatisfactory work conditions, age, and marital
   status. Alternatively, Kazakhstan attracts scholars via pull factors
   that include salary, sense of adventure, and the opportunity to build
   new institutions and programs as well as conduct research. Unlike
   previous studies that highlight boundaryless mobility and individual
   agency, this study reveals constraints that mediate international
   faculty mobility. Furthermore, salary plays a limited role as a pull
   factor particularly among early career academics who are seeking
   research opportunities and meaningful contributions in building new
   academic programs and institutions.},

Abstract = {Information about road crash costs is a valuable input for road safety
   policy making and it is essential for conducting cost-benefit analysis
   of road safety interventions. This paper presents a methodology for
   assessing the socio-economic costs of road crashes as well as an
   estimate of the volume of these costs in Kazakhstan. Five costs
   components have been taken into account: medical costs, production loss,
   human costs, vehicle damage and administrative costs. A hybrid
   methodological approach has been used, which implies that three
   different types of methods have been applied to capture all costs: the
   human capital method (production loss), willingness to pay (human costs)
   and restitution costs method (other components). Input data were
   retrieved from existing databases from a variety of road safety
   stakeholders and other organizations. A household survey was conducted
   to collect additional information, including the willingness to pay for
   fatal crash risk reductions. Remaining data gaps have been bridged by
   using data from other countries. The socio-economic costs of road
   crashes in Kazakhstan are estimated at \$6.8 billion in 2012, which
   corresponds to 3.3\% of GDP. Human costs account for 81\% of the total
   costs, vehicle damage for 11\% and production loss for 6\%.
   Administrative and medical costs are relatively very small cost
   components. More than half of the costs is related to injuries, while
   fatalities account for about a third of the total costs and property
   damage only accounts for approximately 10\%. (C) 2021 International

Title = {Assessment of Green Practices in Residential Buildings: A Survey-Based
   Empirical Study of Residents in Kazakhstan},

Abstract = {In the lead-up to the Paris climate change conference, the majority of
   the UN Member States submitted their Intended Nationally Determined
   Contributions on carbon emissions reduction to be met by 2030.
   Kazakhstan is no exception. The government made pledges and, therefore,
   has to adapt its national policies and regulations to meet the set
   ambitious goals. In this regard, the role of residential building sector
   is of the utmost importance due to its significant share in the
   country's energy consumption and carbon emissions profile. Thus, this
   study presents the types of residential buildings available and assesses
   how far they are from meeting the green building (GB) indicators set in
   various certification schemes and standards. This would help in
   suggesting practical steps to improve the sustainability levels of the
   residential building stock of Kazakhstan. This study collected a robust
   set of data on existing residential buildings in Astana, chosen as a
   case study location, classified them and, based on a developed
   checklist, evaluated their performance compared to GB standards. The
   study has found that old buildings tend to have a rather poor level of
   sustainability, whereas the sustainability of new buildings depends on
   the class of the buildingsteadily increasing from economy to premium
   class in all categories of the checklist. A detailed analysis of the
   results has led to the development of recommendations on how each type
   of building should be improved to meet the GB standards.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the evolution of the East Central Eurasian energy
   triangle China-Kazakhstan-Russia. It treats in depth the behavior of
   Chinese national oil companies (NOCs) regarding foreign direct
   investment (FDI) in Kazakhstan and Russia. The first section sets out
   the framework of geo-economics in a complexity-science perspective, in
   particular the key analytical categories of the `emergent coherence'
   approach, and it defines a `hydrocarbon energy complex' (HEC). The
   second section analyzes the formation of the East Central Eurasian HEC
   by examining Chinese energy investment in Kazakhstan and Russia since
   1991, using the `emergent coherence' framework as explained. The third
   section examines the geo-economics of Sino-Russian competition for
   energy resources in Central Asia, specifically in Kazakhstan and
   Turkmenistan, over the same timeframe. The fourth section presents
   conclusions about changes over time in the behavior of Chinese NOCs
   regarding investment in Kazakhstan and Russia and cooperation with them
   in the energy sector. The fifth section, the conclusion, summarizes the
   findings, gives them geopolitical perspective, and concludes on the
   criteria determining the delimitation of the distinct chronological
   periods emerging from application of the `emergent coherence' framework.},

Title = {Informal learning through social media: exploring the experiences of
   teachers in virtual professional communities in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN EDUCATION},
Abstract = {As a source of social capital, teachers' professional networks have been
   linked in the research literature with professional learning. Social
   media platforms have increased teachers' professional networking
   opportunities, suggesting more space for informal learning. Capturing
   the experiences of 41 school teachers in Kazakhstan using thematic
   analysis of semi-structured interviews, the study provides evidence of
   teachers' use of social media within professional communities to obtain
   knowledge manifested in an overlapping mixture of news, information,
   opinion, experience and teaching resources. The study results provide a
   partial explanation for teachers' engagement in virtual professional
   communities in the context of informal learning. Highlighting the need
   for professional connectedness as part of a strong professional
   commitment to learning, the study points to the contextual factors such
   as the professional isolation of teachers in rural schools, the need for
   mentoring support, and the context of educational change. Equally, it
   stresses the role of teachers' self-efficacy to share knowledge, linking
   it with opportunities for informal learning of active and passive
   participants in virtual professional communities. Finally, the study's
   findings also point to the importance of face-to-face collaboration
   within and beyond schools to promote professional knowledge exchange
   within virtual professional communities.},

Abstract = {The actual revival of the natural sacred sites worships and the
   inclusiveness of its new elements is an ongoing dynamic process. It
   correlates with the updating of the narrative, which is related to these
   sacral sites.
   The article aims on identifying and analyzing the current practice of
   honoring of the natural sacred sites and the narratives associated with
   these sites. The focus of the study are the Ulytau worship natural sites
   and related narratives. The key study issues are: the prerequisites for
   contemporary revival of the natural sacred places veneration and
   attributed narratives; the reason for its updating demand; and the core
   nature of these processes.
   For a long period, the Ulytau region has been attracting the interests
   of historians and archaeologists, and a certain academic knowledge has
   been collected here. However,. the specific nature of the Ulytau
   cultural code formation, functioning and preservation of has been never
   a subject of an adequate studies. The article benefits from the works of
   Kazakh and Russian scientists, as well as fact-finding field surveys and
   in-depth interviews of the local inhabitants and sacred sites keepers of
   (baksy, shyrakshy and assistants). The findings were collected within
   the period of years 2016-2018.
   In the course of preparation of this article the authors used the
   retrospective and comparative-historical methods. The article presents
   an analysis of the current worship practice of the natural sacred sites

Title = {Political and Historical Determinants of the Differentiation of
   Entrepreneurial Ecosystems of Agritourism in Poland and Kazakhstan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {(1) Background: In the context of differences among countries developing
   pre-entrepreneurship ecosystems in relation to agritourism, the need to
   define the specific challenges and facilitators in the group of
   post-communist countries is recognised. Given that, we aim to examine
   the differences between the countries belonging to the former USSR and
   the satellite countries of the former USSR. (2) Methods: For the
   realisation of the intended objective, we analysed studies of the
   literature on the subject, in terms of the theoretical treatment of the
   entrepreneurial eco-system in the field of agritourism, and current
   legal acts. Our own observations from stays in the regions in question
   were also used, along with statistical methods concerning the density of
   the transport network, comparative analysis of historical and political
   conditions, and SWOT analysis. (3) Results: Substantial differences were
   found between the components of the agritourism entrepreneurship
   ecosystem in Poland and Kazakhstan, primarily related to the level of
   transport infrastructure density (satisfactory in West Pomeranian
   Voivodeship, insufficient in North Kazakhstan), tradition of individual
   farming (well established in Poland, poorly present in Kazakhstan),
   support for agritourism development by central and local authorities
   (relatively high in Poland, incidental and with a short history in
   Kazakhstan), and finally, differences in the target group of agritourism
   service recipients (stable in Poland, undefined in Kazakhstan). (4)
   Conclusions: The research leads to the conclusion of the heterogeneity
   of the determinants of the development of the agritourism
   entrepreneurship ecosystem in countries collectively defined as
   post-communist. There are clearly different challenges and facilitations
   resulting not so much from the past political system as from the
   ethnic-historical considerations, the position of agriculture in the
   economy, and the degree and effectiveness of the involvement of
   administrative authorities in the development of agritourism. The study
   leads to a recommendation on the need for more efficient targeting of
   agritourism consumers abroad.},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {Considering that today's youth are inadvertently exposed to violence in
   all forms of media and video games, research shows that this affects the
   psyche, subsequently manifesting in aggressive behaviour. This research
   paper examines how media violence, particularly in video games and
   movies, impacted youth behaviour during Uzbekistan's pandemic-imposed
   lockdown period in 2020. The research deploys a mixed-method approach by
   using quantitative online and offline surveys and data collected from
   educational institutions and companies to analyse the impact of media
   violence on youth who chose to play violent video games and watch
   violent movies during the pandemic. At the same time, the qualitative
   thematic analysis presents recommendations for preventing the adverse
   effects of violent video games and films on young people's behaviour.
   The research ends with suggestions on supporting young people and ways
   to protect them from falling into the vicious cycle of violence, which
   triggers aggression in their behaviour.},

   and third languages, identifying the level of activity and particular
   spheres of communication for L1, L2, L3 for informants with different
   sociodemographic characteristics as well as individual motivations when
   choosing, studying and using the second and third languages
   Results. Obtained records point out that the forms of interaction of the
   Kazakh, Russian and English languages are far from being similar.
   Kazakhs who do not know their native language, but only understand
   certain phrases make up 2.7\%. Statistical data analysis revealed that
   80.6\% of Kazakhs are fluent in Russian, 1.4\% of Kazakhs do not know
   Russian, 1.0\% of Kazakhs are able to understand certain phrases. The
   age groups of 21-25, 26-35, and 36-45 have the highest English speakers
   percentage.
   Conclusions. The Kazakh-Russian-English trilingualism is widespread
   among representatives of various social and professional groups of the
   oil industry, who speak their native Kazakh and Russian languages
   fluently, and also know how to communicate in English.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the potential of nine multipurpose tree species for
   afforestation of degraded land in the Khorezm region, Central Asia,
   particularly their suitability for biodrainage i.e., lowering the
   elevated groundwater table through the transpirative capacity of
   plantations. For this purpose water use (WU), water use efficiency (WUE)
   and tree physiological factors influencing transpiration were assessed
   during two consecutive years. Mean daily leaf transpiration differed
   significantly among the species and ranged during the seasons from
   4.5-5.2 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for Prunus armeniaca L. to 4.5-10 mmol(-2)
   s(-1) for Elaeagnus angustifolia L. WU differences were triggered by
   species physiological features such as capability of water uptake by
   roots. Transpiration rates and the length of fine roots correlated
   highly (r = 0.7). Correlations of leaf transpiration rates with leaf
   area were weaker (r = 0.6). No correlations were found between salt
   content in plants and water uptake under conditions of
   slight-to-moderate rootzone soil salinity. Values of WUE per root and
   shoot DM were similar averaging, respectively, 0.2 and 0.3 g DM g(-1)
   water for two-year-old trees, and decreased with age. In addition to WU
   characteristics, also salinity tolerance, growth rate and the ability to
   produce fodder and fuelwood must be considered during species selection.
   Regarding these features, the N-fixing E. angustifolia ranked the
   highest, combining high WU, fast growth and production of nutritious
   feed. Examined Populus spp. and Ulmus pumila L. ranked lower but still
   represented potential candidates for biodrainage purposes. Typical fruit
   species in the region such as P. armeniaca and Morus alba, showed low
   biodrainage potential.},

   Kazakhstan: A techno-economic assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Growth of the global population is directly associated with the increase
   in energy consumption. This pattern can be predominantly seen in
   emerging economies. However, coping with economic growth while pledging
   to combat global warming is not a dilemma in the Republic of Kazakhstan,
   which launched in 2012 a strategy plan determined to have a 50\% of its
   total energy demand supplied by renewables in 2050. A significant amount
   of energy consumption is generally attributed to lighting systems since
   developing countries are still utilizing non-efficient illuminants,
   including incandescent, tungsten halogen, and high-intensity discharge
   light bulbs. This paper presents the potential impact brought by
   switching current energy-intensive lighting technologies used in most of
   the territory of Kazakhstan to LED technology, scrutinizing three
   subsectors: residential, commercial/industrial and outdoor illumination,
   and considering the incentives of DAMU fund (available to develop green
   businesses) as well as realistic financial parameters. The study depicts
   a large margin of profit for the investors and resulted in an NPV equal
   to 412 bln, 81 bln, and 29.9 bln KZT for residential,
   commercial/industrial and outdoor sectors, respectively. The largest B-C
   ratio is found for outdoor facilities (21.8), followed by the
   residential sector (15.4) and the commercial sector (8.4).},

Title = {The neglected country(side): Earthquake risk perceptions and disaster
   risk reduction in post-Soviet rural Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {171-184},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While increasing resilience to earthquakes in the global South has
   become a major research and policy goal, the focus has largely been on
   rapidly expanding urban areas. Rural areas are often neglected despite
   the fact that rural residents make up a significant proportion of the
   population exposed to earthquakes in many low and middle-income
   countries. Central Asia is a case in point. Drawing on empirical
   research undertaken in the Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan, this
   paper explores local perceptions of and responses to earthquake hazard
   and risk among rural householders. The primary data are derived from a
   survey of 302 households conducted across six rural communities in South
   Kazakhstan oblast (now Turkistan oblast), supplemented by 10 focus group
   discussions with rural residents. The findings show little awareness of
   earthquakes or concern about the potential occurrence of a high
   magnitude earthquake in the future. This reflects, at least in part, a
   lack of direct experience of all but minor earthquakes. As a result, we
   see little evidence of the presence of a seismic culture. Only a small
   number of respondents had received guidance on how to prepare for, or
   respond to, earthquakes, and few householders had taken any action to
   reduce the risk faced. We reflect on the findings in the context of
   Kazakhstan's Soviet past and its transition to a post-Soviet future. We
   argue that acknowledging this past is essential to understanding local
   level decision-making and to informing future disaster risk reduction
   interventions in rural areas.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study documents the experiences of 38 Grade 5 students
   and their six female teachers from four state-maintained schools in
   Kazakhstan teaching/learning English during emergency remote teaching
   and learning (ERT\&L). It was guided by Kearney et al.'s (2012)
   framework that provides three dimensions that influence individuals'
   teaching and learning experience when using technological devices:
   personalisation, collaboration and authenticity. The data collected
   through online individual interviews and students' drawings suggest that
   the participants asserted their agentive reflexivity and critical
   awareness of the advantages and drawbacks of their ERT\&L experiences.
   Several teachers indicated that although ERT\&L helped them make
   financial and professional gains, they had difficulty assessing their
   students' progress online, and work overload had negative impacts on
   their well-being and quality of life. Many students criticised some
   English teaching practices during COVID-19, including the allocation of
   more homework, and lack of co-operative activities and individual
   attention. The study has pedagogical implications and provides further
   evidence of the need for stakeholders to take the well-being of teachers
   into account, promote collaboration between different social actors and
   provide teachers with proper training in the use of online platforms. It
   also stresses the importance of using participatory research methods
   involving children to capture their thoughts and interpretation of their
   emergency remote learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has emerged
   as the most devastating syndemic of the 21st century, with worrisome and
   sustained consequences for the entire society. Despite the relative
   success of vaccination programs, the global threat of the novel
   coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is still present and further efforts are needed
   for its containment and control. Essential for its control and
   containment is getting closer to understanding the actual extent of
   SARS-CoV-2 infections. Material and Methods: We present a model based on
   the mortality data of Kazakhstan for the estimation of the underlying
   epidemic dynamic-with both the lag time from infection to death and the
   infection fatality rate. For the estimation of the actual number of
   infected individuals in Kazakhstan, we used both back-casting and
   capture-recapture methods. Results: Our results suggest that despite the
   increased testing capabilities in Kazakhstan, official case reporting
   undercounts the number of infections by at least 60\%. Even though our
   count of deaths may be either over or underestimated, our methodology
   could be a more accurate approach for the following: the estimation of
   the actual magnitude of the pandemic; aiding the identification of
   different epidemiological values; and reducing data bias. Conclusions:
   For optimal epidemiological surveillance and control efforts, our study
   may lead to an increased awareness of the effect of COVID-19 in this
   region and globally, and aid in the implementation of more effective
   screening and diagnostic measures.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal assessment of agricultural virtual water and
   uncertainty analysis: The case of Kazakhstan (2000-2016)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {724},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {In this study, a fuzzy-vertex-based virtual-water analysis method (FVAM)
   is developed for assessing the virtual water content (VWC) of main
   agricultural products, imports, and exports at a national scale. FVAM
   has advantages in quantifying state-level VWC with a bottom-up approach
   and reflecting uncertain parameters based on vertex analysis technique.
   FVAM is applied to a real case of Kazakhstan in Central Asia. Results
   reveal that (i) the VWC of Kazakhstan's agricultural products is between
   55.61 and 83.98 billion m(3)/yr in 2000-2016, where wheat is the largest
   water consumer and the Kostanay state has the largest VWC; (ii)
   Kazakhstan is a net exporter of virtual water, most of which flows to
   neighboring countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan; (iii) uncertainties
   in crop coefficient (Kc), feed water requirement (FWR), drinking water
   requirement (DWR) and service water requirement (SWR) can affect the VWC
   assessment; (iv) the massive export of water-intensive products makes
   the water resources more severe in Kazakhstan, which further squeezes
   the local ecological water use. Therefore, reducing the export of
   virtual water should be the focus of future agricultural policies. The
   findings are useful for decision makers to optimize Kazakhstan's
   agricultural structure, mitigate the national water scarcity, and
   facilitate the regional sustainable development.<bold> </bold>},

Title = {Effects of tourism development on surface area of main lakes of
   Shchuchinsk-Burabay resort area, Kazakhstan},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {69-86},
Abstract = {Lake (or lacustrine) water is one of the most sensitive and vulnerable
   resources for many tourist destinations, whose attractiveness highly
   depends on the water quality and availability in the lakes. The
   Shchuchinsk-Burabay resort area, located in the Akmola region of the
   Northern Kazakhstan, is one of the most popular tourist destinations of
   the country, known for its attractive natural landscape and for its
   great number of lakes. However, during the last decades, these lakes
   have been facing environmental issues due to their overexploitation and
   increasing level of pollution. Thus, the aim of the current study is to
   examine the changes in surface area of these lakes during the last 30
   years by using GIS technologies, and the influence of tourism industry
   upon this phenomenon. Accommodation facilities (hotels, sanatoriums and
   guesthouses), as main tourism-related water consumers, have been
   targeted within our analysis. Results show that tourism is one of the
   factors responsible for surface area decline of the main lakes in the
   region, and its responsibility increases when combined with other
   factors. This study also formulates recommendations for water management
   policymakers in order to guarantee the sustainability of lake water as a
   key resource of the tourism industry in the region. (C) 2019 Varna

Abstract = {This article explores the current practice of motivating agricultural
   workers in post-socialist settings. In addition, it attempts to evaluate
   the different wage systems observed in reality and better understand
   under which conditions they are reformed. It does so by contrasting the
   experience of two extreme cases representing fast and slow reform
   advance, East Germany and North Kazakhstan. The primary data for the
   analysis comes from cross-sectional farm surveys conducted by various
   researchers in both countries. East German farmers quickly replaced the
   inherited Soviet-style piece rate payment system by simple time rate
   schemes, augmented by wage premia for certain performance parameters,
   especially in livestock. To the contrary, the piece rate approach
   persists in many farms in North Kazakhstan. Moreover, the latter rarely
   use non-wage incentives to motivate their workers. In Kazakhstan, farms
   using either mixed systems or pure piece rates were more productive than
   the reference group using pure time rates. Labour cost per worker were
   lowest for pure time rate systems in both countries, followed by mixed
   bonus systems, whereas pure piece rate systems implied the highest cost
   in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstani managers tend to move away from the Soviet
   piece rate system if external investors become engaged in farming
   operations.},

Abstract = {The article reports the results of an interview-based study exploring
   how international PhD holders re-integrate into the research environment
   in Kazakhstan. One of the main results consistent with prior studies is
   that returning scholars face poor access to international and domestic
   scholarly societies. Interaction with external peers is problematic due
   to insufficient funding available for conference participation. Lack of
   communication with the domestic scholarly community is related to its
   inaccessibility for junior researchers, as well as to its propensity to
   operate as an informal network of senior scholars controlling the
   protectionist distribution of funding and exerting influence on
   administrative and policy decision-making in academia. To counteract the
   informal networks, returning scholars get organized into alternative
   informal networks aimed at information exchange, mutual support and
   lobbying of interests. This transformative activity of junior scholars
   cannot be explained with the dominant structural theories in the
   existing research. An alternative Agency Theory interpretation is
   considered.},

   study of post-graduate students in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SECOND LANGUAGE WRITING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In an increasing number of post-graduate programmes in Kazakhstan,
   students may be expected to produce academic or professional texts in up
   to three languages-Kazakh, Russian, and English. While previous research
   has shown the benefits of genre-based approaches to English academic
   development, this study seeks to understand students' development of
   genre knowledge in multiple languages simultaneously. Using Tardy's
   (2009) four-part genre knowledge framework, a survey measuring
   self-reported genre knowledge in three languages was developed and
   administered to Master's and PhD students (n=283) at 6 Kazakhstani
   universities, followed by interviews of students (n=43), teachers (n=34)
   and administrators (n=30) on approaches to genre knowledge development.
   Survey data revealed students generally have higher genre knowledge in
   Russian, followed by Kazakh and English. Students have higher Formal
   knowledge than other types of genre knowledge across languages.
   Interview findings suggest students are primarily influenced by IELTS
   exam-based, Formal knowledge approaches to education in English. The
   results suggest a need for both explicit instruction in non-structural
   elements of genre knowledge in three languages, and expanded
   identification of the key components of genre knowledge in languages
   other than English.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is analysing the experince of
   Kazakhstan in implementing distance/online learning during pandemic. The
   COVID-19 pandemic has affected all areas of social and economic life,
   including education. More than 1.3 billion students worldwide have
   switched to online/distance learning. In Kazakhstan, more than 6 million
   active participants in the educational process are navigating this
   online migration. There is significant criticism of the process among
   the general population, demanding scholarly investigations into the
   government's actions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the re-organization of
   education in Kazakhstan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods to uncover
   this included an express survey of 31,300 households, in interviews with
   65 parents, 15 children, 9 school/college/university administration and
   teachers and 15 representatives of the Government of Kazakhstan, and in
   analyses of statistical and regulatory documents.
   Findings - This study finds that the government of Kazakhstan has faced
   significant issues in the transition to distance/online learning due to
   weak internet infrastructure and a lack of effective interaction with
   all stakeholders, as well as biased statistical and analytical
   information.
   Originality/value - The pandemic has functioned as a test of government
   readiness for crisis and has exposed several fault lines where official
   development policy has been ineffective. While the ``gap{''} between
   policy and outcome is often attributed to failures in local
   implementation, the unique factors at play here - an interested
   citizenry and committed teachers - show that considerably more work has
   to be put into bringing ``best practices{''} from developed countries to
   developing ones.},

Title = {Integrating development aid into social policy: Lessons on cooperation

Abstract = {In many low- and lower-middle-income countries, development aid accounts
   for a large share of social expenditures. However, its fragmentation is
   among the major challenges to the efficiency and sustainability of
   policy measures. In reaction to this challenge, the Sector-Wide Approach
   (SWAp) to development aid proposes pooling resources in order to improve
   cooperation and increase ownership by the recipient state. The SWAp to
   health care in Kyrgyzstan, which started in 2005, is treated as one of
   the major success stories in the expert community and the academic
   literature. To allow for systematic analysis of the many-fold principles
   incorporated into the SWAp blueprint, we re-conceptualise it as an
   ideal-type causal mechanism leading from improved cooperation to
   efficient aid implementation. Based on a case study of the second phase
   (2012-2018) of the SWAp to health care in Kyrgyzstan we highlight
   critical junctures in the implementation of a donor-supported social
   policy.},

Title = {Discourses of Russian-speaking youth in Nazarbayev's Kazakhstan: Soviet
   legacies and responses to nation-building},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-236},
Abstract = {Research into post-independence identity shifts among Kazakhstan's
   Russian-speaking minorities has outlined a number of possible pathways,
   such as diasporization, integrated national minority status and ethnic
   separatism. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with young people in
   Almaty and Karaganda, I examine how Russian-speaking minorities identify
   with the state and imagine their place in a `soft' or `hybrid'
   post-Soviet authoritarian system. What is found is that Russian-speaking
   minorities largely accept their status beneath the Kazakh `elder
   brother' and do not wish to identify as a `national minority'.
   Furthermore, they affirm passive loyalty to the political status quo
   while remaining disinterested in political representation.
   Russian-speaking minorities are also ambivalent towards Kazakh language
   promotion and anxious about the increasing presence of Kazakh-speakers
   in urban spaces. This article argues that two factors are central to
   these stances among Kazakhstan's Russian-speaking minorities: the
   persistence of Soviet legacies and the effects of state discourse and
   policy since 1991.},

Journal = {ETHNOS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},
Pages = {375-397},
Abstract = {This article traces the production and circulation of state officials'
   portraits in post-Soviet Kazakhstan, as visual artists engaged in the
   cultivation of an art market after the dismantling of socialist-era
   state sponsorship. I argue that these portraits of the president and
   other high-ranking officials should be considered as an instance of
   commercialisation of art. Portraiture invoked proximity of artists to
   their powerful sitters, government officials, and consequently made
   artists' work more attractive to a particular kind of domestic buyer.
   Furthermore, I argue that these practices of commodification enable an
   understanding of how socialist-era legacies of state sponsorship have
   converted into the logics of proximity to power. The Soviet-era
   personalistic connections to bureaucrats have transformed into the means
   for representation of artwork's market value in contemporary Kazakhstan.
   As such, Soviet legacies of clientelism have rendered state icons as
   significant authenticators of commercial value and therefore central to
   the emerging market.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the core forces and drivers of
   the creative transformation of a traditional industry through the
   assessment of the mares' milk industry (MMI). Using an exploratory
   single case study, this research reveals the main driver mechanisms and
   challenges of the creative transformation of a traditional industry
   using the case of the MMI in Kazakhstan. Grounded theory, along with
   in-depth interviews of 36 MMI business staff in Kazakhstan, has been
   used in this study. The research identifies the following four key
   driving factors for transforming a commodity-based traditional industry
   into a cultural creative emerging industry: National demand, ingenuity
   and creativity, affordance (support), and actors (attitudes, skills, and
   characteristics). This study also explores challenges, such as
   administrative negligence, the threat of losing authenticity, poor
   industry cooperation, and cultural branding. A sustainable
   transformation into a creative MMI requires the government to give its
   full attention to implementing existing-related policies, emphasizing
   the role of authenticity, stressing the importance of industry
   cooperation, and promoting iconic branding. The study findings will help
   policy makers, administrators, and related stakeholders to understand
   the transformation of the MMI when developing related policy, strategy,
   and sustainable development. The findings can also serve as guidelines
   for other traditional agricultural sectors that are undergoing
   transformation into creative industries.},

   strategy for secondary powers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {975+},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan has followed a foreign policy of multivector diplomacy since
   its independence from the former Soviet Union. While multivectorism was
   a strategy of necessity in its early years, it has evolved to empower
   Kazakhstan to effectively protect its independence and negotiate its
   relationship with the great powers on its borders and further afield.
   After the 2014 Russian seizure of Crimea it is noteworthy that
   Kazakhstan has maintained positive relations with Russia while asserting
   its sovereignty and independent foreign policy. In this article we
   investigate how Kazakhstan has negotiated the rise of China, taking
   advantage of the economic opportunities it presents. We trace the
   foreign policy of Kazakhstan from independence forward, examining its
   relationships with its Great Power neighbours and its role in
   international organizations and negotiations. We posit that
   multivectorism is similar to the strategy of omni-enmeshment and complex
   balancing seen in south-east Asia. Both are effective methods for
   secondary powers to protect their sovereignty and to coexist with Great
   Powers without becoming their client states. Kazakhstan's approach to
   foreign policy is an exemplar for secondary states. This article
   contributes to the literature on the strategic decision-making of
   secondary powers and to the theoretical analysis of the foreign policy
   of Kazakhstan during a critical moment of transition from the long-time
   rule of Nursultan Nazarbayev to the presidency of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.},

   were able to coexist together in both policy and practice. Drawing on
   fieldwork among a number of villages in South Kazakhstan, we argue that,
   together, the nomadic and Soviet pasts still constitute the core values
   at work in rural communities, influencing the structure of local power
   relations and the nature of group association and cooperative venture.
   Rather than disappearing, these values, if anything, are re-emerging as
   part of an attempt to legitimise Kazakh culture as the core identity of
   the modern nation state.},

   serves as a contested area divided between Russian and Kazakhstani
   nation-building projects. While keeping in mind the antagonistic
   politics of both states, this research rather focuses on the everyday
   practices and personal narratives of Russian speakers living in this
   area. With the help of empirical material collected during the
   interviews and dwelling alongside the participants, this article
   demonstrates how through symbolic practices and everyday life
   experiences Russian speakers differently construct their understanding

Title = {The shifting geopolitics of higher education: Inter/nationalizing elite
   universities in Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, and beyond},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {46-54},

Abstract = {This article examines recent higher education projects in two
   resource-rich, developmental states: Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. These
   projects are indicative of broader trend across Asia to move beyond
   previous national universities, toward a state-initiated model of the
   globally competitive university, which is designed to become an regional
   hub for elite education. Drawing on a range of qualitative methods, I
   consider the geopolitical context in which these projects have been
   conditioned and materialized, with a focus on how they are legitimated
   by policy-makers in the two case countries. By reframing discussions
   about the globalization of higher education in terms of a geopolitics of
   higher education, I argue that the cases of Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia
   are not exceptions set outside of the hegemonic liberal system, but that
   they are `mirrors' of recent internationalization agendas undertaken by
   elite Western universities. Through considering localized discourses of
   promoting knowledge-based economies, I consider how elites
   simultaneously work with and reconfigure globally-hegemonic discourses,
   and specifically how these elite university projects are part of broader
   authoritarian political configurations in Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia.

Abstract = {Competition is claimed to be beneficial in development projects
   promoting micro and small enterprise finance although there are still
   doubts as to whether these loans can be developed into a profitable
   business. Our research sheds new light on the question of how many MSE
   banking units should optimally be created and supported in a certain
   region. We employ a unique data set from the European Bank for
   Reconstruction and Development for Kazakhstan, and investigate which
   strategy contributes more to the overall success of the programme: a
   strategy of setting up several competing banks or a strategy of
   establishing regional monopolies. `Competition is the most important
   principle on which our strategy is based. As in any other market,
   effective competition provides incentives for banks to offer
   market-based and demand-oriented financial services. Competition
   encourages the development of better products and services at lower

Title = {Forced telecommuting during the COVID-19 lockdown: the impact on
   corporate culture in Spain and Kazakhstan},
Journal = {CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper studied organizational culture in two different
   countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, a stressful social and labor
   context that obliged entire working populations to telecommute from
   home. We considered how people have coped with this new scenario,
   bearing in mind that one of the most relevant aspects of organizational
   culture and climate is the face-to-face interactions that take place in
   offices. With telework, that important physical relationship disappears
   and, since body language has its own grammar, work-related messages
   logically become open to misunderstanding between leaders and
   subordinates, as well as among peers. Design/methodology/approach An
   anonymous questionnaire (in Spanish and Russian) was distributed through
   the LinkedIn social media platform. The study intended to capture
   responses from white-collar professionals with managerial profiles,
   including those occupying high and medium-level positions, consultants,
   section directors, and project managers across different industries in
   both the countries. We collected 142 responses from Spain and 115 from
   Kazakhstan, with a total of 257 valid responses. Principal component's
   analysis (PCA), to obtain factorial axis was applied. We then performed
   a factor analysis of those principal components using Coheris Analytics
   SPAD 9.1. Findings The first finding herein points to the fact that the
   same experience had different consequences in these two different
   places, which can be traced back to national-cultural values. Spain and
   Kazakhstan share some common values and, at the same time, are
   culturally opposite. People fear uncertainty and one of the best ways to
   avoid this feeling is to provide them with technical and emotional
   support to manage a situation. During the COVID-19 lockdown,
   professionals from both countries expected their bosses to be assertive,
   driven, attentive and encouraging. And it seems they got just that.
   Secondly, a robust structure is mandatory for feeling secure: workers
   reported devoting more hours to telecommuting at home and even felt that
   their jobs were invading their personal lives, but they handled it
   because they knew to whom they should report. Procedures, rules, and
   methods were clear enough to avoid uncertainty. They even invented new
   rituals, patterns and practices that helped to reinforce their sense of
   belonging to the team. On top of this, in their responses, they noted
   that leaders acted consistently, even admirably, during lockdown and,
   for this reason, they gained their subordinates' respect. Research
   limitations/implications Responses from female participants more than
   doubled those from males in this sample. Women are assumed to prefer
   flexible working conditions so that they can better take care of
   children and/or elderly or dependent persons, but this could just be a
   long-standing bias. On the other hand, the incorporation of women into
   professional life has feminized work environments, translating into more
   concern for workers' personal circumstances and more awareness of the
   human relationships therein. Thus, independent of the country studied,
   gender is another factor to consider for future research. Practical
   implications This article proposes further exploratory study of how
   organizational contexts are affected by unexpected, informal and even
   radical changes, as well as of organizations' ability to manage said
   changes by looking to their cultural values. Originality/value Facing a
   common enemy- the coronavirus- seems to have made workers more positive
   and less prone to complaining.
   Workers have been resolute and have tried their best not only in their
   individual work, but also with their co-workers and teams. The data
   suggests that, even when analyzing two diverse countries in terms of
   their cultural historical, and sociological contexts, companies'
   reactions impacted their employees somewhat similarly and engendered
   similar responses. At the same time, the reactions of Spanish and
   Kazakhstani professionals vary on certain aspects, and, surprisingly,
   converge in terms of avoiding uncertainty, which suggests a conservative
   reaction in both countries. This study concludes that structure (clarity
   of procedures, norms, patterns) and leaders' recognition of their
   employees' efforts to overcome uncertainty were of utmost importance.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the project Sacred Geography of Kazakhstan,
   launched in 2017 in Kazakhstan as part of the nationwide program Ruqani
   Zhangyru (Modernization of Spirituality). The officially stated goal of
   the project is to cultivate a sense of patriotism in the country's
   residents related to places and geographic sites that are important for
   the historical memory of independent Kazakhstan. The authors assume that
   the real goal of the project is national territorialization, or recoding
   of the semantics of space, by selecting, codifying, and articulating
   some symbols and practices, while leveling and ``forgetting{''} others.
   The analysis, which is based on expert interviews and official
   documents, shows that this postcolonial process fits into the tendency
   toward ethnonationalization of Kazakhstan, in which discourse on the
   civil nation continues to be reproduced at the official level, while
   real activity is more focused on reinforcing the idea of Kazakhstan as
   the state of the Kazakh nation. The institutionalization of organizing
   and recoding the sacred landscape involves a wide variety of groups and
   actors. These factors may explain the success of the project in
   comparison to other projects being implemented under the Ruciani
   Zhangyru program.},

Abstract = {In the era of globalization, the development of countries with a small
   open economy largely depends on the intensity of using various forms of
   international economic relations, among which the competitiveness of
   each country plays a special role. At the present stage of development,
   the problem of competitiveness is central to the economic policy of the
   state. Creating competitive advantages over an opponent becomes a
   strategic direction of the state and its bodies and applies to all
   levels of the hierarchy: products (goods and services), enterprises,
   industries, regions and the country as a whole, but the country's
   competitiveness is of particular importance. The competitiveness of the
   region is determined in comparison with other similar facilities. This
   characteristic refers to estimated indicators, therefore, it assumes,
   along with the subject and subject of the assessment, the presence of
   certain criteria. Evaluation criteria (goals) may be the market
   position, the pace of development, the ability to pay for the borrowed
   funds received, consumer properties in relation to the price of the

Abstract = {Norm contestation by local actors has emerged in recent years as an
   explanation for the failure of norm diffusion. This article contributes
   to the literature on norm contestation by analysing how norms diffused
   by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
   pertaining to election observation and free and fair voting are
   re-constituted and contested by domestic actors in Kazakhstan. The study
   contributes to the idea of constitutive localisation' by emphasising a
   more fundamental level of disagreement beyond just congruence between
   the diffused norm and local beliefs; by demonstrating contestation can
   occur in the later stages in the norm diffusion cycle; by focusing on
   the micro-politics of contestation by local actors involved in the
   implementation of diffused norms; and by revealing how norm contestation
   is not necessarily a process of emancipatory politics, but a strategic
   act to serve authoritarian consolidation. Utilising a four-fold
   framework, the analysis illustrates how norms, while initially accepted
   by Kazakhstani authorities, are reconstituted through political
   discourse and/or practice, creating the moment of contestation. While
   this contestation is instrumentalised by political elites for their own
   advantage, it also remains an important element of agency within a
   normative order which they had little previous control over.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to study the peculiarities of religious
   conversion and changes in religious consciousness on the example of
   women living in Kazakhstan. The following methods were used for the
   study: focus group and individual interview. In the focus group, a group
   discussion was conducted during which the attitude of the participants
   to religion and religious activities was clarified. The total number of
   study participants was ten. It was a homogeneous group of older women.
   Discussion in the focus group was conducted using the open method. The
   method of individual interview involves an individual expert review. As
   a result of the study, the following conclusions were made. The increase
   in the level of religiosity and religious identification are associated
   with ethnic origin (if Kazakh, then Muslim, if Russian, then
   Christian-Orthodox). The participants showed intolerance towards
   religious conversion. The novelty of the research is associated with the
   study of the phenomenon of religious conversion, which has undergone a
   certain historical evolution. The research interest is aroused by Kazakh
   society with a predominance of traditional Islamic culture, which often
   rejects religious conversion in relation to its followers. The
   researchers were interested in the process of transformation from a
   forcedly atheistic society to a secular society with a free choice of
   religion. Religious conversion in Kazakhstan led to the transformation
   of the post-Soviet reality, radically changing it in the form of
   `conversion of change'. This formulation of the question allows the
   authors to apply Western theories of religious conversion to Kazakh
   reality. The methodological basis of the research includes R. Stark and
   W.S. Bainbridge's theory of affiliation, as well as L.R. Rambo's model
   for conversion.},

Abstract = {Countries of the Middle East and Central Asia depend heavily on natural
   resources for their exports, income, and employment. This study is a
   preliminary investigation that explores the effect of natural resources
   on domestic investment in a sample of 12 highly resource-dependent
   countries in the Middle East and Central Asia from 2000 to 2019. The
   recently advanced cross-sectional dependent auto-regressive distributed
   lag (CS-ARDL) model and panel quantile regression are employed. The
   results validate the accelerator theory that an increase of the non-oil
   GDP growth rate has a robust positive impact on domestic investment,
   while natural resources crowd-out domestic investment. The long-run
   estimate of ICT reveals a significant positive impact, while corruption
   shows a significant negative effect. These findings urge sample
   resource-dependent countries to focus on developing ICT-based
   enterprises and control prevailing corruption levels. Moreover, adopting
   liberal trade policies can also enhance domestic investment
   opportunities.},

   the social and cultural determinants of help-seeking among Kyrgyz women
   who have experienced domestic violence. Results indicate that cultural
   traditions and social normsmost notably the social construction of
   marriage, the shame associated with divorce, and the status of
   daughters-in-law in Kyrgyz societyare used to justify domestic violence
   and prevent victims from seeking help. The proposed theory and results
   suggest that scholars, policymakers, and front-line contacts must
   emphasize dispelling myths, misconceptions, and traditional beliefs
   about gender and marriage to break the abusive dynamics and provide

Abstract = {The entry of non-mining companies into the world market raises the
   problems of strategic planning and company management especially
   significant in a market economy. The considered model of strategic
   planning and management is versatile and suitable to the development
   strategy of companies taking into account regional and national
   interests. The aim of the study is to develop recommendations for the
   application of modern methods of strategic management in the non-mining
   companies to determine the main routes for the development of this
   industry in a pandemic. The information base of current investigation
   includes legislative and other normative acts of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan, statistical data of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan
   on Statistics, analytical materials, materials of scientific economic
   literature and periodicals, materials of scientific and practical
   conferences, data of electronic resources, as well as financial
   statements of Top 40 foreign companies. Research methods. In this work,
   the following methods such as abstract-logical, economic-statistical,
   monographic, as well as methods of system analysis, economic comparison,
   expert assessments, economic and mathematical modeling were used.
   Conclusions: The main provisions and conclusions given in this work can
   be used in the development and implementation of strategic management
   policy and further planning of non-mining companies. In the process of
   analyzing the non-mining industry, a forecast was identified for the
   development of strategic planning for their further activities, since
   oil companies-subsoil users are basically important and active agents of
   economic and social development, receiving income as a result of the
   development and use of oil fields in Kazakhstan. Research out-comes:
   Using the provided statistical data on the indicators of non-mining
   companies, we analyzed the influence of some factors affecting the final
   results of companies' activities by creating a regression model, and
   also analyzed the impact of investments in fixed capital in the
   non-mining industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the pro-duction
   volume (goods and services) achieved by this industry.},

   In 2018, the President of Uzbekistan called for adoption of a revised

   modern realities. The article offers an overview of the draft Chapter on
   crimes against the peace and security of mankind, as proposed by the
   author in his capacity as a member of the Working Group for revision of
   the Criminal Code. It draws upon the best practices of a number of

Abstract = {After three decades of post-Soviet agrarian change, farming structures
   in Tajikistan remain dynamic. Despite a centralised reform agenda pushed
   forward by international donors, the local implementation of reforms has
   resulted in striking differences in agrarian structures across the
   country. This paper investigates Tajikistan's geography and agrarian
   political economy. We show that the unevenness of the Tajik state's
   power and autonomy vis-`a-vis societal actors has been important in
   bringing about stark differences (1) spatially, between regions, and (2)
   between policy design and selected statistical indicators on agrarian
   reform on the one hand, and the policies' sluggish implementation on the
   other.},

Title = {Actives, passives and power: heteronormative gender norms and their
   implications for intimate partner violence among men who have sex with
   men in Tajikistan},

Abstract = {Global research reveals that gender-role norms have a profound effect on
   socio- and psycho-sexual expression (e.g. sexual positioning) among gay
   and bisexual men, which in turn may affect mental health and sexual
   risks. However, little is known about these factors among gay and
   bisexual men in Muslim-majority countries such as Tajikistan. Using a
   combination of in-depth individual interviews and focus-group
   assessments, this exploratory, qualitative study examined how gender
   roles might function as a social determinant for the practice of sexual
   positioning, which in turn may influence intimate partner violence
   (IPV), sexual risk and relational power. Results suggest that being the
   `active' partner in sexual relationships closely aligns with the
   construct of hegemonic masculinity, affording actives more power in
   male-male relationships which may in some cases result in IPV directed
   against `passives'. Despite this imbalance, passives also hold power in
   some cases, such as easier access to public resources such as the police
   and gay and bisexual focused services. Further research should examine
   gender norms and sexual positioning relative to IPV and sexual risks
   among Muslim men in Tajikistan.},

Abstract = {The research reported in this paper explored the implementation of a
   language-in-education policy in post-Soviet Kazakhstan, also known as
   trilingual education reform. Drawing on interviews with teachers and
   school administrators, the paper comparatively examines how the teaching
   of Sciences through the medium of English was implemented across two
   different educational contexts in one country. The analysis shows that
   different processes were undertaken to involve teachers in the reform
   and get them to implement change. The network of elite Intellectual
   Schools approached language planning by exerting positive pressure,
   offering ongoing capacity building, emphasising core pedagogy, and
   providing opportunities for `learning in context,' whereas the policy in
   the context mainstream schools was characterised by excessive speed,
   fragmented solutions and the failure to provide micro-level policy
   actors with sufficient tools to implement change. The paper argues that
   piloting results should be carefully considered before scaling up the
   reform to a larger context. Finally, the paper suggests core premises of
   educational change should inform language planning and policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Despite the benefits associated with the free movement of people,
   governments often try to regulate urban immigration by constraining the
   agency of potential rural out-migrants in moving to cities and/or in
   expanding their agency to enable them to stay put. We apply an
   institutional framework centring on push-pull and retain-repel factors
   to migration intentions of potential migrants in northern Kazakhstan. We
   model the effects of these factors on migration intentions with Bayesian
   Networks and expand the baseline model with three policy scenarios. The
   results suggest that the effects of policies constraining urban
   in-migration, e.g. limiting access to affordable housing, are attenuated
   by social networks and reverse remittances. The supply of accessible and
   appropriate information on possible income and true housing costs in
   urban areas presents a promising road to reduce intentions of rural
   out-migration. Better schools and decentralised tertiary education can
   also reduce the migration intentions of rural residents.},

Abstract = {Usable water resource is limited, even though 71\% of world is covered
   by water. Therefore, enough conflicts to the usable water can be found
   throughout the world. Usable water for irrigation is a top priority,
   probably it would be seconding only to the drink water supply. However,
   prioritizing one usage over another is challenging to many stakeholders.
   Therefore, sustainable water usage is essential to avoid any conflicts
   among the stakeholders; nevertheless, highly challenging in the
   developing world. Therefore, this paper discusses the water saving
   irrigation practices and ways to use agriculture around the world,
   including Uzbekistan. Relying on the ancient irrigation technologies
   used by ancestors and also modern irrigation methods, different
   irrigation water management technologies are presented to apply for
   various weather conditions and water availability situations. Suitable
   irrigation practices are discussed based on the water needs especially
   the arid countries, such as Uzbekistan. The results of an experiment
   conducted for hilly areas of Uzbekistan using ``mulching{''}
   agro-technology is presented along with its suitability for Uzbekistan.
   Therefore, the expectations of sustainable water usage for irrigation is
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) is one of the leading congenital deformities
   among the world. Children born with CL/P experience problems with
   feeding, speech, hearing, and dentition. In developed countries, CL/P
   patients are receiving optimal health care involving multidisciplinary
   team approach and staged surgical operations, whereas in developing
   countries, there is severe shortage of both medical and financial
   sources. To overcome these limitations, humanitarian surgical missions
   are essential. The aim of this article is to share our experience of
   humanitarian surgical mission in Uzbekistan consisting of 6 consecutive
   visits between 2009 and 2014. The series of these humanitarian
   activities consisting of 6 consecutive visits was organized by the
   cooperation of Interplast Turkiye and governmental Turkish Coordination
   and Cooperation Agency. After initial evaluation, triage at the initial
   setting and prompt anesthesia evaluation among many more of them, 529
   patients mostly with cleft, craniofacial, or congenital deformities were
   operated. The success of this type of mission is not solely based on the
   expertise of the team members, but also meticulous planning, patient
   selection, good coordination with the local colleagues and
   communication. At this point, caregivers attending from a culturally
   close and similar language-spoken countries will certainly have more
   advantages in achieving a mission. Volunteer surgical missions for
   congenital deformities can be an important relief for this burden in
   developing countries. Nevertheless, training the native surgeons and
   supporting the plastic surgery foundations in these countries are as
   important as providing the necessary health care by such humanitarian
   missions.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Since irrigation water is assumedly the predominant factor determining
   crop yield, the difference in irrigation water availability across the
   administrative sub-districts of the Khorezm region, Central Asia, also
   inflicts an unequal distribution of agricultural revenues. Considering
   the national aim of a fair distribution and efficient use of resources,
   here we analyze the relationships between irrigation water access and
   rural welfare from 2000 to 2007 by descriptive statistics. Analyses
   revealed not only the general dependency of agricultural revenue on
   irrigation water availability, but also occurrence of low land
   productivity during water scarce years and, irrespective of the annual
   water availability, in some tail end regions each year. Furthermore,
   apart from irrigation water availability, land productivity was also
   impacted by soil quality, cropping structure, and type of land
   ownership. Fair distribution of water and land resources should also
   take into consideration population density. It is argued that an
   anticipated equal and efficient water allocation necessitates improved
   irrigation water conveyance, distribution, and application efficiency
   via best water management practices. Liberalization of markets,
   development of a market infrastructure and improvement in yields also
   contribute to increased land and water productivity.},

   that the destination image of Uzbekistan is dominated by heritage and
   reference to ancient cultural traditions of the region. However, the
   image represented through user generated content on Instagram is more
   diverse and to a larger extent depict the destination through natural
   heritage and experiences in the natural landscape. Furthermore,
   Uzbekistan is concurrently trying to create a post-Soviet identity
   through a focus on its history prior to the Soviet past, with focus on
   heritage of the Great Silk Road which highlight that destination image
   construction is related to geo-political processes in society which
   includes contestations of national identity.},

Abstract = {Background. The development of high-quality human capital is an
   important objective that involves value orientations, cultural
   dimensions and psychological characteristics activity. This article
   presents a cross-cultural comparison of value orientations and
   psychological parameters of activity among youth from Russia,
   Kazakhstan, and Latvia.
   Objective. The study addressed three questions: (1) Are there values and
   attitudes related to the readiness for activity among youth in the three
   countries? (2) Are there any differences between values and parameters
   of the psychological system of activity in the Russian, Kazakhstani and
   Latvian samples? (3) What values and attitudes predict the youth's
   readiness for activity in each country?
   Design. University students from Russia, Kazakhstan and Latvia were
   invited to participate in the study. The study sample was selected
   according to age, sex and period of living in the country. Value
   orientations, cultural dimensions and attitudes were measured by the
   Values Survey Module, World Values Survey questionnaire, The Subjective
   Evaluation of Basic Values Realisability. Personality Research Form,
   Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, Subjective
   Happiness Scale, Self-Organisation of Activity Questionnaire,
   Differential Test of Reflexivity, and Satisfaction with Life Scale
   questionnaires were applied to evaluate the psychological parameters of
   activity. To analyse the relationship between value orientations and
   psychological parameters of activity, we used analysis of variance,
   Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise linear regression.
   Results. The cross-cultural variance was established for most values and
   cultural dimensions in the Russian, Kazakhstani, and Latvian samples,
   but Personal readiness for activity only differed on the tendency level
   between the Kazakhstani and Latvian samples. Different values and
   attitudes accounted for near 57\% of the Personal readiness for activity
   index in Russia and Latvia, but just less than 29\% in Kazakhstan.
   Conclusion. The activity of university students from Russia depends on
   their need for achievement and level of happiness. In the Kazakhstani
   and Latvian samples, the most important factor was the quality of life
   enjoyment and satisfaction index.},

Title = {Does the adoption of customer and competitor orientations make small
   hospitality businesses more entrepreneurial? Evidence from Kazakhstan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-86},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the influence of customer and
   competitor orientations on the entrepreneurial orientation of small
   hospitality enterprises in Kazakhstan.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research uses quantitative data
   collected through a self-administered questionnaire from 318
   entrepreneurs who participated in the survey.
   Findings - The findings of the study demonstrated that there is a
   positive relationship between customer and competitor orientations and
   the entrepreneurial orientation of small hospitality businesses in
   Kazakhstan.
   Research limitations/implications - Future studies should also consider
   additional contingencies such as organizational learning capability and
   environmental dynamism. In addition, it is recommended that future
   studies look into the effect of customer and market orientations on
   small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) performance.
   Practical implications - The findings of the study showed that
   hospitality in small businesses needs to embrace a new way of thinking
   and adopt a more strategic approach to their entrepreneurial activities
   through proactively responding to constantly changing customer needs and
   competitors' moves.
   Originality/value - This study offers insights into the relationship
   between strategy and entrepreneurship in the context of small
   hospitality businesses. In particular, it develops an understanding
   about the factors that stimulate small hospitality businesses'
   entrepreneurial orientations in a dynamic and competitive environment
   marked by the growing pressure of continuously changing consumer habits
   and direct competition both from SME counterparts and large enterprises.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how secondary school textbooks enact gender in
   post-Soviet Kazakhstan. As a `gender paradox', with universal literacy
   and yet a higher representation of women at the tertiary level
   co-existing with multi-sectoral gaps at the expense of women, Kazakhstan
   offers an interesting context to empirically investigate the taken for
   granted relationship between education, gender equality and sustainable
   development. Poststructuralist discursive analysis is complemented with
   non-discursive methods to illuminate how textbooks entrench gender power
   relations, construct dominant masculinities and enact emphasised
   femininities, producing gender hierarchies and naturalising gendered
   national belonging. Possibilities for transforming gender relations in
   and through education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Agricultural production in southern Kazakhstan has experienced
   significant economic difficulty since the 1980s, accelerating agronomic
   problems including the salinization of irrigated fields. A thorough
   understanding of the up-to-date situation of soil salinization and its
   effects on cropping systems is necessary in order to establish
   sustainable agricultural systems with avoiding land degradation for the
   region. This study examined the relationships between soil salinity,
   crop yield and affecting factors including local terrain for two farms.
   Both farms are characterised by a gentle slope, flat area and localised
   depressions. Most of the paddy fields showed wash-out of salts during
   the irrigation period except in waterlogged fields situated in
   depressions. Rice yield was adversely affected by the remaining soil
   salinity, deep ponding water and insufficient drainage capacity in the
   lower part of the irrigation system. Salt accumulation in the upland
   fields appeared to increase with cropping years, and was associated with
   groundwater depth that became shallower at the lower parts of the
   irrigation systems, adversely affecting the crop growth in most fields.
   Since the cropping patterns had recently changed in the region, each
   pattern was compared against the recommendation of this study. Most
   patterns were concluded to be potentially effective for preventing soil
   salinization if conducted under an optimum economic and social system.

Title = {Effects of training duration and the role of gender on farm
   participation in water user associations in Southern Tajikistan:
   Implications for irrigation management},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {216},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This paper examines whether longer training increases farm participation
   in community-managed water user associations, in a context where
   assignment to training duration was not randomized and none of these
   institutions existed before training began. We also examine whether
   participation is affected when farm managers migrate and leave farm
   operations to other workers, in a context where only managers have been
   directly trained, almost all managers are male, and females are
   increasingly operating farms. We collected microdata from 1855 farms in
   Southern Tajikistan, where farm managers in 40 subdistricts received
   longer training, while those in the other 40 received shorter training.
   These `treatment' and `control' subdistricts were selected by
   constructing propensity scores and matching without replacement to
   address observable selection effects that may affect assignment to
   training duration. Farms were then selected from a census using a
   stratified random sampling process. A difference-in-difference technique
   with right-hand-side covariates is employed, where both sets of data
   were collected after training was completed. This choice of econometric
   methods controls against farm-level selection effects, but introduces a
   potential bias due to measurement error. Longer training has a causal
   effect on increasing participation in WUAs. Results also demonstrate
   that when male workers not directly trained operate farms, participation
   is not affected; however, participation is negatively affected when
   female workers operate farms. These results provide evidence for
   designing irrigation management programs to target female workers
   directly, in order to strengthen institutions whose success depends on
   active farm participation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether the level of academics' societal
   engagement (ASE) is higher or lower at universities with leading
   research university (LRU) status compared with institutions at lower
   status levels within vertically stratified systems. In a theory-based
   purposeful sampling, we studied the correlation of LRU-status and ASE in
   Canada and Germany (intra-academic competition-based status model) and
   Kazakhstan and Russia (state-assigned status model). In Canada and
   Germany, universities have self-organized LRU-status groupings, such as
   the U15. In Kazakhstan and Russia, the National Universities' LRU-status
   was assigned by the state. In Russia and Germany, Excellence Initiatives
   blur status-assignation models. Survey data is provided by the
   cross-country study ``Academic Profession in Knowledge Society
   (APIKS){''}. We find that techno-commercial ASE is only positively
   correlated with LRU-status in countries with state-assigned status
   groupings. Dissemination ASE is not correlated to LRU-status. Negative
   correlations between dissemination ASE and LRU-status are found in
   Canada. The results show that societal recognition (captured by
   industry, ministry, etc. grants) and LRU-status run in parallel in
   Russia and in Kazakhstan. In comparison with Russia, societal
   recognition is a distinct mechanism in Germany, which is not triggered
   by LRU-status. In Canada, ASE is mainly correlated with individual
   (status) determinants.},

Title = {Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development in a Resource-Abundant
   Country: Challenges of Wind Power Generation in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent years, the environmental effects of energy production have
   increasingly entered into the foreground of the sustainable development
   agenda. Hydrocarbon-abundant countries are blamed to become the largest
   emitters of greenhouse gases, trace metals, and other pollutants due to
   extensive use of oil, gas, and coal in energy production. Combustion of
   fossil fuels for heat and power generation is reported to be among the
   major reasons for progressing climate change globally. The United
   Nations and other international actors have called on national
   governments to substantially increase the share of renewable energy, but
   the main point is how to incentivize the resource-rich countries to
   shift to greener technologies. For the example of Kazakhstan, whose
   energy sector is centered on coal, this paper discusses the challenges
   and prospects of wind power as both an environmentally friendly and
   efficient option to support a transition of a resource-rich country to a
   green economy and a sustainable energy future. Forty-two locations
   across the country have been assessed on the parameters of average
   annual wind speed, wind availability, and four types of potential for
   wind power production: gross, technical, economic, and emissions
   reduction. Some of the key findings are that at the height below 50 m
   above ground level, wind power production is economically viable in
   electricity-deficientt southern territories, particularly, in Djungar,
   Saryzhas, Zhuzimdyk, and Taraz. In western, central, and northern parts
   of Kazakhstan, at a height above 50 m, the most promising areas for wind
   power production are Caspian, Northwestern, Central, and Tarbagatay
   corridors. The paper identifies the areas with the highest emission
   reduction potential and elaborates the policies to encourage the
   selection of wind farm locations based on their economic
   potential-environmental effect ratio. The approach allows assessing the
   opportunities, which decentralized wind energy systems offer to
   transition away from a dependence on fossil fuels and to enable
   sustainable economic growth.},

Abstract = {This enquiry addresses production and employment effects, which emanate
   from the extractive industries of Kazakhstan. To this end, the study
   employs static input-output models (IOMs) of Kazakhstan for the years
   2007, 2010, 2012 and 2017 and dynamic nonlinear autoregressive
   distributed lag (NARDL) models for the period 1995-2018. IOMs show that
   extractives in Kazakhstan exhibit relatively strong links to domestic
   manufacturing. NARDL estimators reveal a positive relationship between
   commodity revenues and manufacturing value added in the commodity
   revenue boom phase and a high level of resilience of Kazakh
   manufacturing to the downward movements of the commodity revenues.
   Commodity revenues have a statistically significant positive impact on
   the aggregate employment rate. The study does not detect asymmetries
   concerning the job creation effects of the manufacturing sector.},

   we find weak statistical evidence of CSR engagement among the farms

Abstract = {Administrative reform is a key element of postsocialist transformations.
   There were three rounds of New Public Management-inspired administrative
   reform in Kazakhstan, yet they did not lead to substantial increases in
   the quality of governance. This lack of progress is partially the result
   of a lack of attention to the issues of administrative culture in the
   blueprints of administrative reform. This article explores elements of
   administrative culture in Kazakhstan such as power distance, sub-ethnic
   groups (Zhuz), and teams of civil servants. The analysis is based on the
   outcomes of bivariate statistical tests and a multiple regression. The
   article shows that the prevalence of teams and ethnic groups has an
   impact on civil servants' perceptions of the effectiveness of
   administrative reform. The study also suggests that the civil service in
   Kazakhstan is characterized by a high power distance, which may
   undermine the principles of New Public Management.},

   to have been rewarded' with prestigiously located housing.},

Title = {Prevalence and socio-economic factors determining use of modern

   demographic and health survey},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {56-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of modern
   contraceptive use (MCU), and to identify socio-economic factors that are
   associated with MCU among married men in Kyrgyzstan.
   Study design: A cross-sectional study based on the 2012 Kyrgyzstan
   Demographic and Health Survey data.
   Methods: This study used data from 460 married men aged 20-49 years.
   Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-squared test and logistic
   regression were used to estimate the prevalence of MCU, and to define
   factors that influence MCU among married men in Kyrgyzstan.
   Results: The prevalence of MCU among married men aged 20-49 years was
   22.2\%. Men in the richer quintile were less likely to use modern
   contraceptives than men in the poorest quintile (adjusted odds ratio
   {[}aOR] 0.267, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.100-0.715). Men with
   three living children had higher odds of MCU than men with no children
   or one child (aOR 3.534, 95\% CI 1.221-10.229). Men who were unemployed
   were more likely to use modern contraceptives than men who were employed
   as manual labourers (aOR 4.511, 95\% CI 1.104-18.442).
   Conclusion: Top priority should be given to strengthening family
   planning communication programmes among married men and male education.
   There is a need to pay attention to the socio-economic determinants of
   MCU among men in the development of family planning programmes. Emphasis
   should be placed on increasing MCU among men with high socio-economic
   status. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by

Abstract = {Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) have different titles, goals and rules, but
   they share the underlying objective of helping governments deal with the
   problems created by large and variable revenues (mainly from energy or
   other commodity related sectors). In Kazakhstan, such a fund (the
   National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK)) was established in
   2000. This fund operates as both a stabilisation and a savings fund. The
   first test for the NFRK was 2007-2009 financial crisis, where the NFRK
   ``saved{''} the economy and guarantied its speedy recovery. The paper
   analyses the NFRK's operation up to 2007 and during the crisis years
   2007-9, before drawing conclusions and implications for the future.
   Between 2001 and 2007 the NFRK conservatively accumulated assets, which
   proved to be useful in limiting the impact of the post-2007 crisis.
   However, the pre-2007 experience indicated structural weaknesses
   associated with discretionary executive authority and non-transparency.
   The paper concludes by observing that this history has created
   significant challenges for the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The given article presents the results of studying the system of Muslim
   education in Kazakhstan in the context of the anti-religious policy of
   the Soviet state and the struggle against ethno-confessional educational
   institutions in 1920s. The authors explore the features of state policy
   in the field of Muslim education, its impact on the quantitative growth
   of Muslim schools in the first half of the 1920s and their almost
   complete elimination by the end of the decade applying the methods of
   discursive analysis of previously unused archival sources and regulatory
   documents. The article considers the main methods of counteraction of
   the Soviet party and state bodies to the creation and expansion of the
   network of Muslim educational institutions, the teaching of the Muslim
   faith in Soviet schools.
   Based on the results of the study, it was possible to establish that the
   loyal policy of the Soviet state in relation to Islamic education in
   1917-1926 was due to the political tasks of strengthening the power of
   the Bolsheviks in the region. Its consequence was the growth of the
   Muslim movement in the republic, and the network of ethno-confessional
   educational institutions that had been formed before October 1917 not
   only grew in number, but also successfully competed with Soviet schools
   both in material and organizational terms. With the strengthening of the
   power of the Soviets and with the beginning of the formation of a
   totalitarian system in the country in the late 1920s, the struggle of
   the Soviet state with Islamic religious institutions acquired a tough
   and uncompromising character. Mass liquidation of Muslim religious
   worship objects began in the republic, mektebs and madrasahs were
   closed. Such a policy caused the natural resistance of Muslims,
   suppressed by the authorities with administrative and repressive
   measures.},

Abstract = {Stalin's collectivization campaigns and the associated famine killed
   millions in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, yet the two countries commemorate
   the events quite differently. In Ukraine, the Holodomor (death by
   hunger) occupies a prominent place in the public sphere and is
   remembered most frequently as a genocidal policy against the Ukrainian
   nation. In Kazakhstan, the famine takes up little space in the public
   arena, and officials remain reluctant to call it a genocide. This
   article explores these differences using two models explaining variation
   in the politics of memory: one emphasizing the instrumental calculations
   of political elites and the other emphasizing the historical and
   cultural constraints that frame contemporary debates. These two models
   complement each other rather than compete. The contest over the famine
   in Ukraine was in part a consequence of eastern and western Ukraine's
   differing histories, but it intensified when governing politicians
   deployed the memory of the famine instrumentally in the 2000s. In
   Kazakhstan, political calculations led the regime to emphasize unity and
   stability over divisive debates about the past, but historical factors
   made depoliticizing the famine feasible.},

   resistance to curriculum change in English language teaching and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE},
Abstract = {This qualitative research study sought to understand teachers'
   resistance to English language educational change in Kyrgyzstan. The
   participants were six English teachers working in both rural and urban
   public schools in Kyrgyzstan. Analysis of non-participant observation
   and post-observation interviews revealed that, despite changes in
   English objectives following changes in socio-economic and political
   context after the demise of the Soviet Union, the lock-in practices in
   English language teaching still persist in Kyrgyzstan. This is because
   educational reforms have occurred only at a structural level {[}e.g. the
   National Curriculum Framework (NCF), State Standards and publishing new
   textbooks] and have lacked planned capacity building-through targeted
   professional support and adequate teaching and learning resources-to
   bring the envisioned curriculum change to the classrooms. The findings
   indicate that the intended change has not yielded the much-desired
   outcomes because each element at every educational level is linked
   ceremonially and loosely, and is decoupled, which provides insights
   about teachers' resistance to curriculum change.},

   experiences with online teaching and learning during the COVID-19
   lockdown. In this paper, qualitative pedagogical research in the local
   conditions of the three mentioned universities is used, with the
   processing of answers of selected students who were interviewed as an
   available sample. The students were also asked to describe their
   impressions of this situation from their social and personal points of
   view. The focus is on the positive and negative aspects, boundaries, and
   problems of online university teaching during the pandemic situation, as
   well as changes in the personal life of the students. The aim of this
   introductory small-scale study is to provide a basis for future research
   on the impact that the COVID-19 situation has had on the educational
   process at the above-mentioned universities, as well as to assist
   educational providers in foreseeing and eliminating the possible
   problems of lecturers when establishing an online educational
   environment. Some conclusions are drawn from the interviews that offer
   potential for further research in educational science, because many
   difficulties from the students' point of view are related to their
   social status, lack of social contact, technical problems with Internet
   connections, the carrying out of lectures and the exams of students. The
   students' answers are categorized, and each category is described.},

Abstract = {Purpose. The research purpose is to develop a geomechanical model for
   ensuring the safety of mining operations by de-termining the optimal
   slope angles and probabilistic assessment of the stability of the
   open-pit walls.Methods. Three-dimensional geomechanical models for
   surface mining of deposits have been developed based on calcula-tions of
   the stability factor (safety factor - SF) of the open-pit walls in the
   Rocscience program to determine the rock mass stress-strain state at the
   end of mining using the finite element method. The geological wireframe
   model (GWM) has been built on the basis of the available geological
   sections, horizon plans and the results of the engineering-geological
   surveys using the Surpac geoinformation system. Findings. Strength
   reduction factor (SRF) has been determined taking into account the
   physical-mechanical properties of rocks that constitute the near-wall
   mass. An assessment of the stability of walls according to the selected
   geological sections is given, taking into account the projected contour
   of the Severny Katpar open-pit walls. The calculation of the projected
   contour stability of the open-pit walls by several different methods has
   revealed that the open-pit walls are generally stable. The open -pit
   parameters at the end of mining have been determined.Originality. For
   the first time, it has been determined that in the Southern and
   South-Western area of the Severny Katpar open-pit wall in the horizons
   +700...+400, there is a decrease in SF from 1.18 to 1.41 due to the
   predominant occurrence of siltstones and tectonic disturbances of the
   walls.Practical implications. The mathematical calculation results of
   the stability of the projected contour walls in the Severny Katpar open
   pit have been generalized. In addition, a geological and structural
   wire-frame model of the deposit has been de-veloped, which makes it
   possible to ensure the safety of mining operations in the open pit.},

Abstract = {Conspicuous pseudo-leisure consumption is a nowadays whip of modern
   post-Soviet societies, what was overcame by developed countries with a
   hard work. This phenomenon prevents for economical subjects to exist in
   balance with disposable level of incomes in boarders of unstable system
   of resource - oriented developing economies. The worst thing in this
   situation is not this phenomenon by itself, but an affliction attitude
   for it from the side of citizens and state in general. Sightless and
   incorrect following the traditions, which are perverted with modern
   realities, pushes people to unreasonable consumption of leisure goods
   and this fact makes them ``hunted{''} into some credit regards and
   future adversities. This problem is related to a small experience of
   citizens in these states about living in immature capitalistic society
   and Kazakhstan is not an exception as well. However, if republic takes
   course for moving into the tops of mostly developed world counties, it
   will be necessary to adopt them a habit to move for a wealth and
   prosperity, as fast as it possible, because such approach is based on
   the principals of developed states in aspect of quality of living. For
   realization of this point it is very important to keep a high level of
   consumption culture, prevent its negative exertions in aspect of
   consumption of different imported goods, what pushes population into
   banking debts. This fact spoils all indexes of living qualities and
   total situation in financial sphere of state's life, what explodes by
   decreasing confidence of banks to unreasonable and unreliable subjects
   for potential lending.},

Abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that personal values of
   Self-Transcendence are a positive predictor of environmentalism, and
   Self-Enhancement values are a negative one, these results are not
   conclusive for all cultural contexts. Regarding political ideologies,
   research concludes that liberals tend to be more concerned about the
   environment than conservatives. However, this two-dimensional take on
   political ideologies does not grasp the diversity of political views,
   which could be achieved by focusing on political values. In this
   research, we studied the role of personal and political values in
   predicting environmental attitudes and behavior in Kazakhstan, a
   developing country in Central Asia. Using an online survey (n = 305), we
   found that Security was a strong predictor of both environmental concern
   and New Environmental Paradigm (NEP), overshadowing the effect of
   traditionally accepted value dimensions of Self-Transcendence and
   Self-Enhancement. While Self-Direction positively predicted
   environmental concern, Universalism and Benevolence were positive
   predictors of NEP. Among political values, Civil Liberties predicted NEP
   positively, and had no significant effect on environmental concern,
   while Free Enterprise predicted environmental concern negatively, and
   had no significant effect on NEP. Environmental concern was a strong
   predictor of all pro-environmental behaviors included in the study
   (littering, recycling, environmental citizenship, and community action),
   fully mediating the effect of NEP. Based on personal and political
   values, three profiles of Kazakhstanis who engaged differently in
   pro-environmental behavior were identified.},

Abstract = {The primary goal of the article is to understand the political and
   socio-economic incentives for government agencies to adopt various
   collaborative strategies in promoting current public sector reforms in
   Kazakhstan. In particular, paying special attention to the recent
   diffusion of various official blog platforms, public discussion, and
   civic tracking systems, it aims to identify typical drivers and barriers
   that policymakers and other interested stakeholders face today in
   advancing technology-driven government. The key findings of the research
   suggest that the development of official e-collaborative platforms
   provides new promising opportunities to promote mutually beneficial
   cooperation between government and citizens, and to boost public sector
   innovations. However, the further sustainable development of the
   movement, not only as a technological tool of public sector reforms, but
   also more as a new philosophy of governance, would require the further
   harmonization of regulation policies at all institutional levels, the
   transformation of the traditional public mindset, and, most importantly,
   the promotion of more genuine grass-root trends in government. In this
   regard, the results of the research could conceptually be used to test
   further the limits of the modern theory of network governance in an
   unusual institutional context of digital centralization. Points for
   practitioners The observation and analysis of practical aspects in the
   operation of various collaborative projects, which is presented in this
   article in an explicitly illustrative manner, could be interesting for
   e-government policymakers and practitioners, as well as for all those
   who try to understand the phenomenon as an ongoing political and
   socio-economic process.},

Abstract = {This study, carried out in tailings from two sediment-hosted stratiform
   copper deposits in the Lublin-Glogow Copper District in Poland
   (Kupferschiefer-type deposit) and Zhezkazgan (cupriferous sandstone-type
   deposit) in Kazakhstan, analysed the mineralogy of copper, zinc, and
   lead minerals as related to metal accumulation in sediments. Microscopic
   study in reflected light and SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron
   Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometer) analysis, as well as chemical
   diversity in the used INAA (Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis),
   ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma), and AAS (Atomic Absorption
   Spectroscopy) methods in 35 samples from Kazakhstan and 35 from Poland
   were examined due to their diversity. In both tailing deposits in
   Kazakhstan and Poland, heavy fractions were dominated by copper
   sulphides: chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), bornite (Cu5FeS4). and chalcocite
   (Cu2S). Moreover, sphalerite, galena, and cerussite have been recognized
   as a carriers of Zn and Pb. Their geochemistry was dominated by Cu,
   showing a mean content of 2500 ppm, in both Poland and Kazakhstan. Zinc
   and lead also occurred, showing a content of approximately 200 ppm and
   500 ppm in Poland, and 1500 ppm Zn and 2500 ppm Pb in Kazakhstan,
   respectively. Grain size analysis indicated that the dominant grain size
   in both districts corresponded to the silt and fine sands fractions.
   Copper, zinc and lead sulphides accumulated in fine fractions in
   tailings from Kazakhstan (in sandstones and quartz grains), and mainly
   in coarse fractions in Poland (within carbonates, sandstones, and black
   shales). Mineralogical and geochemical features should be taken into
   consideration when assessing potential metal sources of technogenic
   materials.},

Title = {Student voice in Lesson Study as a space for EFL teachers' learning: a
   case study in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR LESSON AND LEARNING STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-166},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report the findings from a case
   study of an action research project in the context of a secondary school
   in Kazakhstan where, for the first time in their teaching practice,
   three English as a Foreign Language teachers introduced student voice
   (Flutter and Rudduck, 2004) into their practice within the Lesson Study
   (LS) framework. The research aimed at conceptualizing Student Voice
   Space in LS as one of the valuable factors capable of triggering
   situations of disjuncture (disorienting dilemma, disruption) for
   teachers which could potentially lead to teacher's transformative
   learning, educational beliefs change and improved practice.
   Design/methodology/approach The study adopts the qualitative research
   design and follows narrative inquiry methodology (Lyons and LaBoskey,
   2002) with a series of narrative interviews (Bauer, 1996) as the main
   method of data collection within a single case study (Bassey, 1999) of
   an action research project. The data were analyzed as text following a
   general inductive approach (Thomas, 2003) where emerging themes were
   identified by means of data reduction. Findings The findings suggest
   that listening to student voice triggers teachers' going through certain
   stages of Mezirow's transformative learning theory including critical
   assessment of own assumptions, testing new options for behavior and
   reflecting critically on the teaching practice. Therefore, the authors
   suggest that Student Voice Space in LS is one of the important factors
   capable of triggering the teacher's transformative learning. Moreover,
   it has an enormous potential not only to bring about positive changes in
   teachers' practice but also challenge the ossified teachers' educational
   beliefs, and thus, potentially, pave the way for a gradual change from
   ``inappropriate beliefs{''} (Mayrhofer, 2019), or subconscious
   assumptions that lie in the core of teachers' folk pedagogies (Torff,
   1999), or taken-for-granted frames of reference (Mezirow, 2000) into
   true, justified or informed educational beliefs. Originality/value
   Carried out in the largely overlooked by the academic literature context
   of the Reform at Scale (Wilson et al., 2013) in Kazakhstan and building
   on the original combination of theoretical lenses, the research
   contributes to the academic literature aiming at illuminating ``the
   black box of teachers' learning{''} in Lesson Study (in Widjaja et al.,
   2017, p.358) since it is one of the rare studies attempting to connect
   teacher learning, student voice and Lesson Study (Warwick et al., 2019).
   Additionally, approaching teacher learning in Lesson Study from the
   transformative learning perspective combined with the literature on
   teachers' educational beliefs and student voice, this study contributes
   to the further development of a shared vocabulary for discussing teacher
   learning in Lesson Study.},

Abstract = {This study presents the results of a seasonal municipal solid waste
   composition campaign, that took place over the period of September 2017
   to June 2018 in the capital city of Kazakhstan, Astana. Four sampling
   campaigns were conducted in order to identify the seasonal variation of
   municipal solid waste composition, recyclables and energy potential
   materials, such as combustible fraction, useful for the evaluation of
   waste-to-energy potential. The combustible fraction was analysed for
   thermal fuel properties, such as proximate and elemental analyses and
   gross calorific value. The results over the four different seasons
   showed that the average recyclable fraction of municipal solid waste on
   a wet basis of 33.3 wt.\% and combustibles fraction was 8.3 wt.\%. The
   largest fraction was the organics (47.2 wt.\%), followed by plastic
   (15.4 wt.\%) and paper (12.5 wt.\%). Small seasonal variations were
   observed for organics, paper, plastic and glass fractions. The highest
   values were found in summer for the organic waste, in spring for paper
   and plastic and autumn for glass. The recyclables fraction showed an
   absolute seasonal variation of 5.7\% with a peak in the winter season
   (35.4\%) and the combustibles fraction showed a seasonal variation
   between 8.3 wt.\% to 9.4 wt.\%. Finally, the average calorific value of
   the combustible fraction was estimated to be 21.6 MJ kg(-1) on a dry
   basis.},

   The Case of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {The paper aims to assess the relationship between Azerbaijani and
   Kazakhstani exchange rates and crude oil prices volatility. The study
   applies the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. The paper
   concentrates on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, the post-Soviet countries
   considered as some of the most oil-dependent countries in the Caspian
   Sea region. The impulse response functions suggest that the rise of
   crude oil prices is associated with the exchange rates decrease and thus
   with an Azerbaijani manat and Kazakhstani tenge appreciation against the
   U.S. dollar. Moreover, the results suggest that an oil price increase
   leads to the rise of Azerbaijani international reserves. However, the
   results are insignificant for the Kazakhstani foreign exchange reserves.
   Additionally, the study reveals a negative and significant relationship
   between crude oil prices and USD/KZT in both pre-crisis and the COVID-19
   crisis periods. We reveal that the correlation has been stronger during
   the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relationship is not significant in
   the case of the Azerbaijani manat. The USD/AZN exchange rate has been
   stable since 2017, and the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has not
   caused a change in the exchange rate and a weakening of the Azerbaijani
   currency, despite significant drops in crude oil prices.},

Title = {Benefit and risk evaluation of inland nuclear generation investment in
   Kazakhstan combined with an analytical MGT method},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Purpose In the process of building the ``Belt and Road{''} and ``Bright
   Road{''} community of interests between China and Kazakhstan, this paper
   proposes the construction of an inland nuclear power plant in
   Kazakhstan. Considering the uncertainty of investment in nuclear power
   generation, the authors propose the MGT (Monte-Carlo and Gaussian Radial
   Basis with Tensor factorization) utility evaluation model to evaluate
   the risk of investment in nuclear power in Kazakhstan and provide a
   relevant reference for decision making on inland nuclear investment in
   Kazakhstan. Design/methodology/approach Based on real options portfolio
   combined with a weighted utility function, this study takes into account
   the uncertainties associated with nuclear power investments through a
   minimum variance Monte Carlo approach, proposes a noise-enhancing
   process combined with geometric Brownian motion in solving complex
   conditions, and incorporates a measure of investment flexibility and
   strategic value in the investment, and then uses a deep noise reduction
   encoder to learn the initial values for potential features of cost and
   investment effectiveness. A Gaussian radial basis function used to
   construct a weighted utility function for each uncertainty, generate a
   minimization of the objective function for the tensor decomposition, and
   then optimize the objective loss function for the tensor decomposition,
   find the corresponding weights, and perform noise reduction to
   generalize the nonlinear problem to evaluate the effectiveness of
   nuclear power investment. Finally, the two dimensions of cost and risk
   (estimation of investment value and measurement of investment risk) are
   applied and simulated through actual data in Kazakhstan. Findings The
   authors assess the core indicators of Kazakhstan's nuclear power plants
   throughout their construction and operating cycles, based on data
   relating to a cluster of nuclear power plants of 10 different
   technologies. The authors compared it with several popular methods for
   evaluating the benefits of nuclear power generation and conducted
   subsequent sensitivity analyses of key indicators. Experimental results
   on the dataset show that the MGT method outperforms the other four
   methods and that changes in nuclear investment returns are more
   sensitive to changes in costs while operating cash flows from nuclear
   power are certainly an effective way to drive investment reform in
   inland nuclear power generation in Kazakhstan at current levels of
   investment costs. Research limitations/implications Future research
   could consider exploring other excellent methods to improve the accuracy
   of the investment prediction further using sparseness and noise
   interference. Also consider collecting some expert advice and providing
   more appropriate specific suggestions, which will facilitate the
   application in practice. Practical implications The Novel Coronavirus
   epidemic has plunged the global economy into a deep recession, the
   tension between China and the US has made the energy cooperation road
   unusually tortuous, Kazakhstan in Central Asia has natural geographical
   and resource advantages, so China-Kazakhstan energy cooperation as a new
   era of opportunity, providing a strong guarantee for China's political
   and economic stability. The basic idea of building large-scale nuclear
   power plants in Balkhash and Aktau is put forward, considering the
   development strategy of building Kazakhstan into a regional
   international energy base. This work will be a good inspiration for the
   investment of nuclear generation.
   Originality/value This study solves the problem of increasing noise by
   combining Monte Carlo simulation with geometric Brownian motion under
   complex conditions, adds the measure of investment flexibility and
   strategic value, constructs the utility function of noise reduction
   weight based on Gaussian radial basis function and extends the nonlinear
   problem to the evaluation of nuclear power investment benefit.},

Abstract = {The artists of the Sixtiers generation in Soviet Kazakhstan have
   typically been understood as the creators of an authentic Kazakh style.
   This article demonstrates that a web of constructed vectors helped
   consolidate art as `Kazakh' in the 1960s and early 1970s. I argue that
   the Sixtiers mined the history of nomadic populations in Central Asia
   for site-specific cultural forms as a means to connect with an expanding
   art world and the global context of decolonialization. Neither wholly
   official nor countercultural, the Sixtiers produced a cultural milieu
   that stretched the limits of the sayable in late Soviet socialism and
   defined the margins of modernity with which Kazakh artists continue to
   contend.},

Title = {Analysis of the stress deformed state of rocks around the haulage
   roadway of the Beskempir field (Kazakhstan)},
Journal = {MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {28-36},
Abstract = {Purpose. To perform research and detailed analysis of the stress
   deformed state of rocks around the haulage roadway based on the
   numerical modeling with the purpose to select the rational type and
   design of the haulage roadway support at the Beskempir field.
   Methods. A comprehensive research method has been used: review and
   generalization of references related to the study of the stress deformed
   state of a rock mass, improvement of the walling technology, in-situ and
   laboratory tests in the research and testing of rock samples strength;
   application of mathematical statistics and processing of experimental
   data using software products. The numerical modeling of the stress
   deformed state was done using the Examine 2D application with due
   account for the shape of broken rocks area, which is a 138.138.138 m
   regular triangle. Barton's Q-system was used to the RQD assessment.
   Findings. The numerical modeling of the stress deformed state of rocks
   in the tectonic fault zone of the haulage roadway at +230 m was
   performed, and the rock mass deformation zones were defined around the
   mine contours. The charts showing displacement of roof rocks and walls
   of the haulage roadway were built, where it was established that the
   maximum displacement was manifest over the tectonic fault zone. The
   following zones were identified: the rock mass instability zones, the
   rock mass instability zones with due account for its fracturing, the
   zones of stable and unstable rock masses of the haulage roadway. It was
   established that 41.6\% of the working with the fault zone is unstable,
   and 58\% of it is a more stable part. It is proposed to divide the
   haulage roadway into three sections depending on the rock stability with
   a certain type of support.
   Originality. Based on the study of the stress deformed state of the rock
   mass in the conditions of the Beskempir field, sitespecific unstable
   sections were identified. They ensured the selection of the support
   design with adjustable resistance.
   Practical implications. The application of support with adjustable
   resistance depending on the rock mass stability ensures minimization of
   costs for roadway support, maintenance of extensive sections of the
   working as well as enhanced mining safety in specific mining and
   geological conditions of the Beskempir field.},

Title = {Evaluating policy success of emissions trading schemes in emerging
   economies: comparing the experiences of Korea and Kazakhstan},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {577-592},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Emissions trading schemes have been increasing in popularity as a
   market-based instrument to meet CO2 reduction commitments. In this
   paper, we examine the emission trading schemes (ETS) of Kazakhstan and
   Korea, two emerging economies. We do so by using a policy success
   typology, which includes programme, process, political, temporal,
   distributional and capacity dimensions, and operationalizing criteria
   that the Partnership for Market Readiness and International Carbon
   Action Partnership have identified as key to effective ETS scheme
   design. We find that these criteria, or ETS success dimensions, align
   well with a typology of policy success. Using indicators developed to
   evaluate each ETS success dimension, we identify the positive and
   negative attributes of both Kazakhstan's and Korea's ETS and provide a
   qualitative ranking for each ETS success dimension. This evaluation and
   ranking allows us to identify necessary conditions for policy success in
   emerging market ETS: consultation with stakeholders in both the design
   and implementation stages; development of human and institutional
   home-grown capacity; mechanisms to solve illiquidity issues using market
   interventions; development of legitimacy from the perspective of
   business over time; implementation of policies that are complementary to
   an ETS; and flexibility to enable firms to manage periods of low
   revenues. Our findings provide important lessons for emerging economies
   planning to implement their own ETS, which may be more relevant than
   experiences from developed nations' ETS. Key policy insights
   ETS success requires more than political will and reaching programme
   goals. Identifying and involving key business and public stakeholders is
   necessary for ETS success. Capacity building within the public and
   private sectors should be implemented from the design stage of an ETS.
   In emerging economies, where increases in energy prices could lead to
   social unrest, complementary policies are necessary to ensure cost
   pass-through. Liquidity problems likely be experienced during the
   initial stages of an ETS need to be addressed.},

Pages = {141-154},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article provides a full description of the state policy
   of the Republic of Kazakhstan on employment and adaptation of
   repatriates (oralmans) and identify problematic issues in this field. We
   paid attention to the main problems of repatriates in the homeland and
   analyzed the influence of oralmans on the internal labor migration in
   Kazakhstan.
   OBJECTIVE: This is the first independent study that investigates the
   Kazakh people who have returned from abroad, who form part of the
   population of internal labor migration.
   METHODS: Various study methods were used, including analysis and
   synthesis, comparison and observation.
   RESULTS: The authors analyzed historical aspects of the formation Kazakh
   diaspora and irredenta abroad, as well as provide information about the
   return of oralmans to the homeland. Furthermore, we separately examined
   the problems that oralmans face after returning to their homeland, and
   tried to identify the cause of each problem. The main problem was
   unemployment among oralmans. Because of the lack of a permanent job,
   oralmans often become subjects of internal labor migration.
   CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed various statistical data in terms of the
   numbers, formations, and dispositions of the oralmans. We furthermore
   analyzed the measures implemented by the state to solve existing
   problems. In the concluding part of the article, the authors give
   concrete recommendations on howto prevent the participation of oralmans
   in internal labor migration.},

   in 2017. Hosting recognized expo bring hundreds of millions of dollars
   and extensive international exposure of the host nation's culture and
   economy. The present study analyzes how the attitudes of local citizens,
   in particular, patriotism, cosmopolitanism, and satisfaction, affect the
   international economic integration of Kazakhstani economy. The current
   study uses a quantitative survey method. Construct measures for this
   research were derived from existing literature. Data from 428
   questionnaires were used for confirmatory factor analysis and regression
   model to test hypothesized relationships. The results showed the
   significant positive relationship between patriotism and satisfaction
   and cosmopolitanism and satisfaction.
   The study contributes to the existing literature on event marketing and
   international exhibitions in the context of transitional economies as
   well as the impact of patriotism and cosmopolitanism on visitor
   satisfaction. The study has implications for practitioners in tourism,
   hospitality, exhibitions, and service industries. The present research
   suggests that patriotic and cosmopolitan attitudes of Kazakhstan
   citizens can contribute to the development of international

Abstract = {The methodology and results of a cost-benefit analysis of air quality
   control during oil production in the Caspian Region in Kazakhstan are
   presented. The benefits are defined as the decrease in health costs from
   reduced air pollution. The health costs are the income losses which
   depend on the attributes of illness (duration and number of symptoms)
   and on respondents' characteristics such as age, education, and gender.
   The results are obtained by comparing two cities, one with a high rate
   of pollution due to oil extraction, Atyrau, and the other, Astana,
   without. The incremental health costs for Atyrau caused by the oil
   production industry are estimated to be at least 5.1 million USD per
   year. The annual benefits of investments into abatement technologies are
   at least five times higher than the virtual annual abatement costs of
   about 0.46 million USD. (c) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The current article deals with the production of knowledge on late
   socialism and its dismantling in Soviet Central Asia (Kazakhstan) and
   Mongolia. Starting with deconstructing conventional debates on the
   nature of Soviet socialism in international and national
   historiographies it bridges them with the popular narratives on the
   causes of socialism's dismantling. Based on oral sources mainly recorded
   in the genres of oral history and life story the research shows the
   gradual replacement of the quest for social equality by nation building
   and ethnicity narratives in Kazakhstan and Mongolia in the 1980-90s and
   after 2000. Pointing out the complexity of social composition in the two
   republics the article attempts to compare the Kazakhstani and Mongolia's
   elite's status vis-a-vis Moscow and the population's attitudes towards
   it that formed the course of the perestroika reform. The analysis of the
   main popular narratives shows their long-lasting acuteness and potential
   for reproduction not only in the republics under study, but also
   internationally. The article underlines interconnectivity of the
   discursive fields in the West and in the second world's peripheries such
   as Central Asia, calling for multidisciplinary approach and
   contextualisation in regional studies.},

Abstract = {Since gaining independence after the dissolution of the USSR, the
   education system in Kazakhstan has undergone significant reforms. The
   retention of highly qualified teachers is crucial for the successful
   progress of the education sphere. However, employing the majority of the
   workforce (26.5\%, almost one million people), education is one of the
   lowest paying sectors. Low pay causes a lack of popularity of the
   teaching profession among youth; results in an aging and highly
   feminized workforce; and harms prestige, status and esteem of teachers,
   thus intensifying turnover and making retention of qualified teachers
   difficult. This study proposes the use of three-tiered temporal,
   regional, and gender payroll data to analyze the prestige, status, and
   esteem of the teaching profession in Kazakhstan. It argues that although
   improving a social package is important, fundamental reforms of the
   education payment system could be the most effective measure to improve
   the prestige and status of teachers.},

   this article argues that Nur Otan, the political party of the President
   of Kazakhstan, acts as a formal institution to counter the instability
   generated by informal networks competing for access to political and
   economic resources. This is achieved by consolidating the political
   parties associated with these networks into Nur Otan and the
   synchronisation of the party and the state apparatus. However, the
   extent to which Nur Otan can provide this stabilising function in the
   long term is dependent upon regime dynamics.},

Abstract = {With the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the education system
   of the whole world got affected severely. With a deep concern for
   safeguarding the little ones, the educational institutions were shut
   down by the respective local governments of almost every country. This
   situation persuaded an inordinate transformation in the
   teaching-learning pattern and led to the massive involvement of
   ICT-based tools with the shift from offline to online mode of teaching.
   The efforts were made to cope with the situation and uphold the learning
   standards of the little ones. In this paper, the impact of the distance
   or online teaching-learning pedagogy adopted by the schools during the
   pandemic has been studied. The study has been done in reference to the
   two countries - Kyrgyzstan and India and for the session 2020-21. The
   study has been done with the help of the three prime stakeholders of the
   school education system, viz. students, teachers, and the parents of the
   school-going children. The study included the conduct of a survey using
   tools like oral questions, interviews, questionnaires, etc. The results
   of both countries are also compared.},

Abstract = {For linguistic minorities, language-in-education policy strongly
   influences perceptions of educational quality. Ranging from
   minority-language instruction to dominant-language instruction, the
   latter is often justified by officials by parental preference and its
   supposed educational and employment benefits. This chapter investigates
   these claims via two extreme cases, the Kyrgyz and Yughur minority
   nationalities of west China, who have experienced minority-language and
   dominant-language education, respectively. Using educational and
   occupational statistics and qualitative data on community perspectives,
   we present evidence that both communities desire first language
   maintenance and Chinese proficiency, finding little difference between
   models in educational attainment and occupational outcomes. However, the
   minority-language model is associated with low Chinese proficiency, and
   the dominant-language model with Yughur language loss, with clear
   implications for the recent introduction of experimental ``bilingual
   education,{''} a dominant-language model taught by bilingual teachers,
   among Kyrgyz. The chapter concludes by cautioning against both
   monolingual approaches, calling for the investigation of alternative
   language-in-education models, such as dual language maintenance
   bilingual education, as a means to promote quality minority education
   through balanced learning of both minority languages and the national
   language. The chapter ends with an argument for increased minority
   community involvement in decisions affecting their children's schooling
   in dialogue with researchers and policymakers.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, a growing body of literature has investigated the
   promotion of good governance, rule of law, democracy and human rights in
   Central Asia through funding from the European Union (EU). Most of this
   research has taken an EU-centric approach and is concerned with the
   supply side of external democratization. As a result, little is known
   about how EU projects are implemented on the ground and what EU-funded
   civil society organizations consider to be their priorities. This
   article investigates the agency of such organizations in Kyrgyzstan by
   focusing on their contribution to one particular EU instrument: the
   Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP), and its
   programme: Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism (STRIVE).
   The findings offer new insights into the processes of adaptation,
   reinterpretation and contestation through which EU-funded organizations
   exercise ownership while engaging in the prevention of violent extremism
   (PVE).},

Journal = {INNOVATION IN LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING},
Abstract = {This qualitative study explores the English learning experiences of 30
   Grade 5 students from three mainstream schools in Kazakhstan during the
   Covid-19 pandemic. It was informed by Benson et al.'s (2011)
   four-dimensional model of language learning beyond the classroom: (a)
   location (physical vs. virtual), (b) formality (formal vs. informal
   agents), (c) locus of control (other-directed vs. self-directed goals)
   and (d) pedagogy. Data were collected through online individual
   interviews and students' drawings. The data suggest that the
   participants' English teachers used mainly Zoom and WhatsApp platforms
   for delivering the online classes. The participants were critical of
   their English teachers' practices, particularly, the overuse of
   WhatsApp, the scarcity of co-operative activities and delays in
   responding to inquiries. Consequently, 16 participants (53\%) were
   receiving face-to-face and virtual private tutoring in English (PT-E).
   Although face-to-face PT-E may be unsafe during the pandemic, PT-E was a
   parental strategy to free themselves from the burden of tracking their
   children's progress. The participants acted agentively, not only
   reflecting on the disadvantages of online education but also on its
   benefits, including its being more convenient and able to help them
   improve their self-reliance and technology skills. The pedagogical
   implications and areas for further research are suggested.},

   rural-urban disparities in Georgia and Kazakhstan. The study contributes
   to an improved understanding of the structural-territorial foundations
   of inequalities in higher education access and charts future directions

Abstract = {This article examines the prevalence and associated multilevel risk and
   protective factors of intimate and nonintimate partner violence among a
   sample of 249 HIV-positive women in Kazakhstan. We found high prevalence
   of both lifetime intimate partner violence (52\%) and nonintimate
   partner violence (30\%). Together, nearly 60\% experienced at least one
   incident of violence by either an intimate or nonintimate partner
   (gender-based violence {[}GBV]). In the multivariate analyses, we found
   associations between several individual, interpersonal, and
   socio-structural risk factors and GBV. Findings provide direction for
   practice, policy, and future research to address the intersection of GBV
   and HIV in Kazakhstan.},

Title = {A strategic approach to selecting policy mechanisms for addressing coal
   mine methane emissions: A case study on Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {185-192},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Coal production globally is projected to grow in the foreseeable future.
   Countries with heavy reliance on coal could reduce methane and other
   emissions through the capture and utilization of coal mine methane (CMM)
   in the short and medium term, while they pursue structural and long-term
   economic changes. Several countries have successfully implemented
   policies to promote CMM capture and utilization; however, some countries
   still struggle to implement projects. This paper outlines key factors to
   consider in adapting policies for CMM mitigation. The authors propose an
   approach for selecting adequate mechanisms for stimulating CMM
   mitigation that involves reviewing global best practices and
   categorizing them functionally either as mechanisms needed to improve
   the underlying conditions or as CMM-specific policies. It is important
   to understand local policy frameworks and to consider whether it is more
   feasible to improve underlying policy conditions or to provide targeted
   incentives as an interim measure.
   Using Kazakhstan as a case study, the authors demonstrate how
   policymakers could assess the overall policy framework to find the most
   promising options to facilitate CMM projects. Kazakhstan's emissions
   from underground coal mines have been increasing both in total and per
   tonne of coal production, while overall production has been declining.
   CMM mitigation presents an opportunity for the country to reduce its
   greenhouse gas emissions in the near and medium term, while the
   government pursues sustainable development goals. Analysis shows that
   policymakers in Kazakhstan can leverage existing policies to stimulate
   utilization by extending feed in tariffs to cover CMM and by developing
   working methodologies for companies to obtain emission reduction credits
   from CMM projects.},

   using more U.S. government sources. The Moscow Times, on the other hand,
   treated protesters in an unfavorable manner, and in some cases appeared
   to identify with the Russian government and the incumbents in these
   three countries. Finally, the two newspapers stressed more on the
   internal causes than the external causes of these political movements,
   but The Moscow Times stressed more on external attributions than The New
   York Times, an indication of its concern over Russian interests.},

Abstract = {The prospects and trends for the development of border regions of the
   former Soviet Union have become one of the profound research areas in
   the field of economic geography recently. In the conditions of planned
   economy in the Republics of the USSR, a vertical system of industrial
   complexes was formed, with the focus on performing national economic
   tasks. There have been some significant changes in the border regions of
   independent post-Soviet States in the process of transition to the
   market economy model. The analysis of the industrial and territorial
   structure is done on the example of Russia and Kazakhstan. The formation
   of a common market on the basis of the Eurasian Economic Union allowed
   the border regions to make the most of their competitive advantage in
   attracting investments. The unique geographical particularity of the
   research object is manifested in the fact that there are no analogues of
   the longest land border in the world as between Russia and Kazakhstan.
   The new forms of production organisation are implemented in the border
   regions of the studied countries over more than 7,000 km. More than a
   quarter of a century later, transformation processes are clearly
   observed in the mining and manufacturing industries, agriculture,
   transport and services. As a result, the ``regional asymmetry{''} of
   industrial development can be observed when manufacturing regions with
   high added value become the ``cores{''} of economic development of
   cross-border relations between Russia and Kazakhstan.},

Title = {The spatiotemporal dynamics of translingual practices and agency: A
   three-year longitudinal study of a migrant youth from Uzbekistan to
   South Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUALISM},
Abstract = {With the large influx of Russian-speaking migrant workers and their
   children to South Korea, there is a growing need to explore the language
   and literacy practices of emerging multilingual learners. Specifically,
   as the Korean language is predominantly used in South Korean contexts,
   including school, Russian-speaking children face enormous linguistic and
   academic challenges and demonstrate different language practices in and
   out of school contexts. Drawing upon the conceptual frameworks of
   translingualism and agency, this three-year longitudinal case study
   attempts to investigate how and for what purposes an emergent
   multilingual youth executes his agency to engage in translingual
   practices within and across different contexts (in and out of school,
   and in an after-school program called Translingual Writing Program) and
   how his participation in translingual practices influences how he
   exercises his agency as a language learner. This study employs multiple
   sources of data to build a multifaceted perspective on an emerging
   multilingual youth's translingual practices and agency across multiple
   contexts over the course of three years. The findings suggest that the
   youth's engagement in translingual practices became more agentive and
   active under circumstances in which his multilingual beliefs and
   competence were valued, and where a relatively large number of resources
   were available.},

   impacts of the multi-sectoral, transboundary mega projects of the BRI on
   tourism development in the destination. In addressing this gap in
   research on attitudes to tourism development in this wider regional
   context, the study confirms the utility of SET as an explanatory
   framework in benchmarking stakeholders' attitudes towards the
   implications of the BRI for tourism development. The findings suggest
   that while there is a strong support for the economic value of China's
   BRI for the sector, there are some concerns that it may undermine local

Abstract = {This article deals with the problem of training modern-type education
   managers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Having gained independence, the
   country has consistently implemented a course for accelerated
   development and integration into the global community, which requires
   skilled managers in key sectors, especially in the field of education,
   since it is this sector that determines the quality of human capital
   and, therefore, the competitive position of the economy as a whole.
   Based on the analysis of international and local experience, it was
   concluded that there are seven main subcompetences (strategic,
   communicative, organizational, psychological, pedagogical,
   entrepreneurial, and political) that constitute the content of the
   managerial competence of a modern manager in the field of education. A
   conclusion was made that the formation of this competence should take
   place at the level of Master's programs, since holders of postgraduate
   degrees form the managerial staff of the education system. A modular
   educational program for Master's students majoring in Pedagogy and
   Psychology was developed and tested at S. Toraighyrov Pavlodar State
   University in 2016-2018. Before the start of this program, as well as
   after its completion, a survey was conducted among Master's students in
   this program (n = 27) to determine how they assess their level of the
   abovementioned subcompetences development. Analysis of the results was
   carried out using the paired sample t-test. The results confirmed the
   effectiveness of the developed program in six of the seven areas, but
   also indicated the need for further work in this direction.},

Abstract = {Entertainment-based events are often held in malls across Kazakhstan and
   United Arab Emirates (UAE), but its crowd pulling power and influence on
   retail sales were seldom estimated or reported. This study addresses
   this void by comparing the impact of such event on the level of visitors
   and retail sales among tenants in MEGA Mall, Kazakhstan and lbn Battuta
   Mall in Dubai, UAE. Data from different store categories in both
   countries revealed that entertainment-based events do increased the
   level of store visitors (during the day of the event) compared to the
   previous weekdays and weekend. Similarly, increased in sales were
   evidenced among mall's tenants in Kazakhstan and UAE (during day of the
   event). Evidence also suggested that anchor tenants (hypermarkets) are
   more likely to see sales increased from such event in both countries. In
   contrast, luxury stores benefited the least from the entertainment-based
   event in both countries. Overall, this study suggested that the hedonic
   value of entertainment-based event works well for family- and
   children-oriented businesses. Recommendations for future are presented.},

Abstract = {This case study analyzes the demographic shifts that resulted from the

   ensued. Contrary to the promise of national emancipation of the local
   population (Kazakhs) through economic development as the pinnacle of
   Soviet nationality policy, the economic authorities in Moscow continued
   to prioritize industrialization over indigenization. They opted to
   import a large labor force from the Slavic and Caucasian republics of
   the USSR rather than training an indigenous proletariat. This policy
   escalated socioeconomic frustrations of the Kazakh population that
   eventually erupted in interethnic strife amid the general rise of
   nationalism in 1989. Violent labor conflicts persist in the region, now
   much more ethnically homogeneous, up to the present, which demonstrates
   that the Soviet-era conflict was a result not just of interethnic
   animosity but the contradictory nature of the Soviet project in general.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore the extent and nature of corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) reporting practices in the banking sector of
   Kazakhstan and investigates the effects of board characteristics on CSR
   disclosures in the given emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach
   Data on CSR disclosures were manually collected from annual reports of
   all commercial banks listed in the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) for
   the period 2010-2016. Financial data were obtained from audited
   financial statements available on bank websites and the Web page of the
   National Bank of Kazakhstan. Findings The empirical results reveal that
   board gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR reposting, while
   board size and board independence have no impact on the level of CSR
   disclosures. Furthermore, the results show that bank size and bank age
   are significant factors in the dissemination of CSR disclosures.
   Additionally, the findings suggest that banks with a share of foreign
   ownership disclose more extensive and transparent information on CSR
   activities than banks owned by local investors and state-owned banks.
   Originality/value The study provides evidence on the relationship
   between corporate governance and the level of CSR in the context of an
   emerging economy such as Kazakhstan, representing the Central Asian
   region. The study contributes to the current literature by focusing on
   the banking sector of Kazakhstan as a research context due to its
   substantial representation in the capital market of the given emerging
   economy.},

Abstract = {The article considers the problems arising in the implementation of
   energy-saving technologies in the housing and communal services sector
   of Kazakhstan, including the example of specific situations. Despite the
   global trend of energy saving and increasing the energy efficiency of
   production and service provision, there is almost no introduction of
   energy-saving technologies by utility companies in Kazakhstan. After
   reviewing the experience of the previous 10 years and the unsuccessful
   attempts of Western manufacturers to enter this market, we identified
   the reasons for this situation, namely, the need to identify the exact
   institutional need for implementation with reference to the Kazakhstan
   regulatory framework, the need to consider the financial effect of the
   projects, not according to the prices of the producing countries (which
   are usually Western countries, where utility bills are much higher) but
   the Kazakhstan energy prices and/or tariffs for the necessary resources,
   as well as the necessity to calculate the economic and/or social
   effectiveness of the project. The authors present the results of the
   analysis of public utilities of Kazakhstan as DMUs (decision-making
   units). Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was chosen as the method of
   analysis, which allows for a nonparametric evaluation of economic agents
   by several input and output parameters. The authors also propose aspects
   of technical policy aimed at the development of energy conservation in
   Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {In previous years, the evolution of nation-building politics in the

   culture is becoming the basis for mutually agreed development of
   ethnocultural and civic identity as its own elements. In the system of
   common Kazakhstani culture, the civil and ethnocultural models of the
   nation are the poles or attractors of the process of self-organization
   of a single nationwide Kazakhstan identity. The optimal identity
   politics in the nation-building risk management in the conditions of
   modern Kazakhstan is to adopt the point of view of the whole set of
   identification models and to maintain the dynamic balance of conflicting
   identities through the mechanism of mutual checks and balances.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {110},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, Uzbekistan is
   challenged to consolidate its efforts and identify and introduce
   suitable agricultural policies to ease the threat of advancing land,
   water and ecosystem deterioration. On the one hand, irrigated cotton
   production provides income, food and energy sources for a large part of
   the rural households, which accounts for about 70\% of the total
   population. On the other hand, this sector is considered a major driver
   of the on-going environmental degradation. Due to this dual nature, an
   integrated approach is needed that allows the analyses of the cotton
   sector at different stages and, consequently, deriving comprehensive
   options for action. The findings of the economic based value chain
   analysis and ecologically-oriented water footprint analysis on regional
   level were complemented with the findings of an input-output model on
   national level. This combination gave an added value for better-informed
   decision-making to reach land, water and ecosystem sustainability,
   compared to the individual results of each approach. The synergy of
   approaches pointed at various options for actions, such as to (i)
   promote the shift of water use from the high water consuming
   agricultural sector to a less water consuming cotton processing sector,
   (ii) increase overall water use efficiency by expanding the highly water
   productive industrial sectors and concurrently decreasing sectors with
   inefficient water use, and (iii) reduce agricultural water use by
   improving irrigation and conveyance efficiencies. The findings showed
   that increasing water use efficiency, manufacturing products with higher
   value added and raising water users' awareness of the real value of
   water are essential for providing water security in Uzbekistan. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Determining the difference in perception of risk between experts, or
   more educated professionals, and laypeople is important so that a
   potential hazard can be effectively communicated to the public. Many
   surveys have been conducted to better understand the difference between
   expert and public opinions, and often laypeople exhibit higher
   perceptions of risk to hazards in comparison to experts. This is
   especially true when health risk is due to radiation, nuclear power, and
   nuclear waste. This article focuses on one section of a risk perception
   survey given to two groups of individuals with a more specialized
   education (scientists and physicians) and laypeople (villagers) in the
   Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan. All of these groups live near the
   former Soviet nuclear test site. Originally, it was expected that the
   scientists and physicians would have similar perceptions of radiation
   risk, while the public perceptions would be higher, but this was not
   always the case. For example, when perceptions of risk pertain to the
   health impacts of nuclear testing or the dose-response nature of
   radiation exposure, the physicians tend to agree with the laypeople, not
   the scientists. The villagers are always the most risk-averse group,
   followed by the physicians and then the scientists. These differences
   are likely due to different frames of reference for each of the
   populations.},

Title = {Consumer Rights in the Republic of Kazakhstan and Their Legal
   Regulation: Transformation in the Context of Global Experience},
Journal = {PUBLIC INTEGRITY},
Abstract = {The relevance of improving consumer protection legislation is due to
   many economic and legal factors, starting with the conceptualization of
   common concepts. Against the background of recent political and legal
   initiatives in the field of consumer protection, this issue has become
   particularly important for the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK). In this
   study, a retrospective analysis of consumer protection regulation was
   carried out. Global trends in legal regulation of consumer protection in
   the RK are considered in the light of their implementation in
   Kazakhstani legislation. The research implies to consider the trends in
   changing the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the field of
   consumer rights regulation from the point of view of the reception of
   world experience. In the study, the analysis of consumer rights
   protection in the multifaceted system of legal protection models is
   carried out and their classification is derived. As a result of a
   comprehensive analysis, it was concluded that it is expedient to
   implement the norms of international law, European law into the national
   legislation of Kazakhstan, modernized in 2020, taking into account the
   proven examples of global legal mechanisms and practices for protecting
   consumer rights.},

Abstract = {This paper describes and analyses the geography and structure of the
   neighborhood residential preferences and residential satisfaction of the
   inhabitants of the medium-sized, post-Soviet city of Ust'-Kamenogorsk,
   Kazakhstan (population ca. 300,000). It is based on a questionnaire
   survey (N = 1516 + 320) conducted by the author in cooperation with the
   statistical authority of the Eastern Kazakhstan oblast'. At the
   aggregate level, the evidence that is presented suggests distinct
   preference patterns, and that the main focus of preference is on the
   city center. The geography of residential satisfaction is different.
   Differences in satisfaction have been found between residents of housing
   built by former high-priority enterprises and those occupying most of
   the remainder of the housing stock. These differences underscore the
   pervasive and continuing importance of the legacy of Soviet economic and
   territorial planning, and the still rather limited changes that the
   marketization of the economy has been able to produce. {[}Key words:

Abstract = {Many countries offer government scholarships for international higher
   education and expect the recipients to contribute to national
   development. While there are many benefits from these scholarship
   programmes, they have been criticized as expensive. We examine the
   perceived contribution of Kazakhstan's two government scholarship alumni
   to the development of the nation. Drawing on Kirkpatrick's model of
   evaluation, we explore the influence of government scholarships on
   Bolashak and Nazarbayev University alumni and their contribution at
   organizational and societal levels. Our findings show that both groups
   of alumni play important roles in developing local talent and
   contributing to the improvement of systems, practices, and policies
   within their workplaces and to wider socio-economic changes. Alumni are
   fostering social developments bringing attention to issues of
   environmental protection and political engagement. However, our findings
   also illustrate that underdeveloped industries, limited job
   opportunities in some fields, low salaries, bureaucratic management
   culture, and resistance to change limit alumni contributions. We argue
   that the problem is at the system level and that the national economy is
   lagging in human capital development. Our findings emphasize the
   critical importance of developing the economy in tandem with education
   and human capital development to reap greater benefits from the
   knowledge of international education graduates.},

Abstract = {It is very important to study the demographic and migration processes in
   the country when forming the labor potential of rural areas. Using these
   indicators affecting the labor potential, we calculated the parameters
   of linear trend models, checking their adequacy of the constructed
   models, calculated the determination coefficients, and built
   confidential intervals for the forecasts. In order to present a
   quantitative model expressing the general tendency of the time series
   change over time, we used the analytical alignment of the time series.
   In this case, the actual levels were replaced by levels calculated on
   the basis of certain data. As a result, we got the result of a change in
   time of the studied indicators in a positive direction. Obtained
   results: outflow of external and internal migration is the reason for
   the decline of labor potential in the country, but in general does not
   affect the efficiency of labor potential of the village; indicators of
   the population in general, i.e., the population of cities and villages,
   internal and external migration with natural population growth are quite
   close to one, what means that their forecast changes are insignificant
   and do not undergo significant changes in the future. Finally, with a
   95\% probability, we can expect that in 2020 - 2021, the indicators
   under consideration will not take values less than the lower limits of
   confidence forecast intervals and not greater than their upper limits.
   Obtain results are very important for development of a strategy for the
   effective use of labor potential.},

Abstract = {This paper reflects on urban cultural development in a post-Soviet
   context. Most literature on arts and the city focuses either on Western
   cities, often recovering from post-industrial decline, or emerging
   global cities. However, post-socialist cities have remained
   under-investigated. The paper argues that the existing accounts of urban
   cultural development often underestimate the impact of national policy
   frameworks and historical trajectories. In post-Soviet countries, these
   national dynamics-often responding to broader diplomatic and cultural
   shifts-need to be considered. The paper uses the case study of
   Kazakhstan and its two major cities Almaty and Astana (recently renamed
   Nur-Sultan) to explore the role of path dependence and national policy
   in urban cultural development. It concludes by arguing for integrating a
   complexity perspective into the study of arts and the city, looking at
   macro policy and infrastructural changes, meso local urban responses,
   and micro dynamics of collaboration and work amongst creative and
   cultural practitioners in cities.},

Title = {The Role of Homogeneity and Heterogeneity Among Resource Users on Water
   Governance: Lessons Learnt from an Economic Field Experiment on
   Irrigation in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY},

Abstract = {The governance of common-pool resources, such as irrigation systems, is
   a highly debated topic in research. Numerous studies suggest that actors
   can successfully manage these resources through cooperation, especially
   in hybrid governance structures, if they are able to design and enforce
   their own rules. Thereby, certain factors, such as the composition of a
   group of resource users, influence the likelihood of cooperation and the
   performance of self-managed resource systems. This study employed an
   economic framed field experiment to compare the effects of externally
   imposed and self-set rules of water distribution on homogeneous and
   heterogeneous groups of irrigation users who differ in their economic
   endowment. The experiment was conducted with 20 farmers in an Uzbek
   community. Furthermore, questionnaires, group discussions and interviews
   complemented the analytical method. The results show that groups,
   homogeneous in their economic endowment are more inclined to comply with
   self-designed rules than groups that are economically heterogeneous.
   Thus, homogenous groups achieve a better performance in terms of
   resource maintenance and water harvest under self-governance. However,
   water distribution was more equal and the illegal activities decreased
   in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups with self-implemented
   rules. It was found that trust was a crucial factor regarding both
   greater individual rule adherence and more cooperative behavior within
   homogeneous entities compared to heterogeneous groups of irrigation
   users. Finally, the results support the argument that economic
   heterogeneity among resource users lowers the likeliness of cooperation
   in self-governed common-pool resource systems.},

Title = {GHG Emissions Assessment as Part of MSW Green Cluster Design: Case of

Abstract = {The increasing pressure on the environment and the exhaustion of
   non-renewable natural resources has led to the emergence of a new type
   of clusters - green clusters. In green clusters, the purpose of
   combining entities into a cluster is not only to increase their
   competitiveness, but also to increase the efficiency of using natural
   resources and reduce the impact on the environment. Companies of various
   types of activities get united into green clusters; this article
   considers green clusters in the field of municipal solid waste (MSW)
   management. The authors described two green clusters in project in the
   field of MSW management in two large cities - Yekaterinburg (Russia) and
   Almaty (Kazakhstan). The main difference between these clusters is the
   ratio between waste management practices. Further, using the IPCC
   methodology for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the authors
   analysed GHG emissions per tonne of MSW in both clusters. The
   calculations have shown that the green cluster of Yekaterinburg is more
   stable and efficient - the carbon content of 1 tonne of processed MSW in
   Yekaterinburg is 22.4 \% lower than it is in Almaty (329.5 kg
   CO(2)eq/tonne of MSW in Yekaterinburg and 424.1 kg CO(2)eq/tonne of MSW
   in Almaty). To reduce the MSW green clusters' climatic impact, it is
   necessary to organize a full-fledged separate collection of different
   types of waste at the household level; to stimulate waste recycling
   activities; to reduce the use of non-recyclable packaging, including the
   implementation of extended producer responsibility; to reduce energy
   utilization, especially at the waste incineration plants; to stimulate
   the use of organic waste shredders. The practical examples discussed in
   this article and the conclusions obtained can be useful to decision
   makers regarding the design and development of green clusters in the
   field of MSW management in large cities. The study relies on the
   research data of the project `Enhancement of the State Regulation Policy
   for Intensifying Clusterization of Industrial Regions' supported by the
   Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Approaches to the organization of management of environmental protection
   within the framework of introduction of Smart City technologies are
   reviewed in this article. For this purpose, a retrospective analysis of
   transformation of the Smart City notion has been carried out and basic
   characteristics of a modern smart city interpretation have been
   distinguished: the use of information technology in all functional areas
   of the city ecosystem, active involvement of residents in the processes
   of city management through organization of a system of user services,
   commitment to sustainable development of a city to the benefit of future
   generations. In the research process the key factors of the environment
   pollution in cities were reviewed having identified systemic challenges
   in the environmental field, which can be solved by introduction of the
   Smart City technology. For each environmental factor promising
   technologies of the Smart City system and effects that may be reached by
   means of their introduction are provided. Analysis of the existing
   technological solutions of the Smart City made it possible to identify
   the complex nature of environmental problems of cities, the solution of
   which requires introduction of smart technologies in all the spheres of
   functioning of the city. In the practical part of the article smart
   city's technology development and implementation experience is
   presented, aimed at environmental protection in the cities of Russia and
   Kazakhstan. The empirical basis of the analysis is constituted by the
   results of the studies carried out within the framework of the research
   work ``Enhancement of the State Regulation Policy of Accelerated
   Clustering of the Industrial Regions{''} implemented on the grounds of

Title = {Ecological State Assessment of Urban Green Spaces Based on Remote

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {83-92},
Abstract = {The rapid pace of urban development triggers complex problems mostly
   related to urban environment pollution, and shortcomings of city's
   improvement. The modern city is characterized by the highest man-made
   pressure on the natural environment, the main problems being
   overcrowding, lack of open-access green areas, as well as the decrease
   of vegetation areas, fact that does not create comfortable living
   conditions for urban residents. At present, remote sensing methods are
   some of the priority tools used in vegetation state assessment,
   particularly, the calculation of vegetation index (NDVI). But often,
   obtaining the necessary information is limited only to the analysis of
   satellite data, without geobotanical field surveys, which considerably
   increase the reliability of the detected results. In addition, the
   definition of dependencies when using an integrated approach of
   different man-affected surfaces with a different type of overgrowth
   within the city remains insufficiently studied. The purpose of this
   study is to assess the ecological condition of the green area (parks and
   squares) in Aktobe city. A comprehensive processing of satellite images
   including the calculation of NDVI index, mapping of green areas and data
   statistical analysis, was carried out. We learned that the average value
   of NDVI for green spaces in Aktobe ranges from 0,11 mu m to 0,47 mu m,
   which allows for the categorization of planted areas by levels of
   photosynthetic activity, from ``unsatisfactory{''} to ``good{''}, yet,
   with 59\% of them in an unsatisfactory condition. This means that the
   city is underdeveloped in terms of modern landscape and infrastructure.
   The obtained results make it possible to assess the current situation,
   determine the dynamics of urban green spaces and optimize spatial
   planning measures for green space management.},

   A Study of Aksu-Jabagly World Heritage Site, Kazakhstan},

Abstract = {The political environment of a tourism destination is the most important
   element in planning, implementing, and controlling sustainable tourism
   development. The political environment refers to the coordination and
   cooperation among many participants to formulate and apply tourism
   policies. In our study the term political environment refers to
   political power, leadership, structures, mechanisms, and strategies, or
   policies for the implementation of sustainable tourism development. The
   main purpose of this article is to, through the example of Aksu-Jabagly
   natural heritage site in Kazakhstan, study how the negative political
   environment (NPE) of a tourism destination inhibits the implementation
   of sustainable tourism development in Kazakhstan. This study draws on
   in-depth interviews with local residents who are considered as one of
   the key stakeholders in the tourism industry. In our research, we
   conducted a questionnaire survey of 222 representative households from
   the neighboring village of Aksu-Jabagly, a natural world heritage site.
   Results show that because of negative political environments, the
   residents highly perceive the negative economic and environmental
   impacts of tourism development. Although the residents highly evaluated
   tourism's positive sociocultural impacts, its relevance to other
   indicators was relatively weak. The residents are dissatisfied with
   tourism development, and their participation level in tourism was low.
   The results also reveal that highly perceived negative economic and
   negative environmental impacts of tourism are the main cause of
   residents' dissatisfaction with tourism development and residents' lack
   of participation in tourism.},

Abstract = {How do we account for multinational energy companies that are able to
   operate in ``risky{''} political environments? While traditional risk
   indices may tell us why a country is considered a difficult operating
   environment, they tell us very little about why some multinationals are
   neverthelessly able to operate successfully in such countries over long
   periods of time. In fact, risk indices by their very nature make
   ``success{''} almost impossible to capture due to their sole focus on
   country behavior. In reality, when a multinational energy company enters
   into a given country, the firm establishes relationships with a series
   of stakeholders, not a single ``host country{''} entity; further, the
   behaviors of those stakeholders (good or bad) do not exist in a vacuum,
   but rather are largely influenced by the multinational's own behavior.
   In other words, the risk is in the relationship between the firm and the
   country's stakeholders. This article argues that success is therefore a
   function of the firm's ability to manage relationships among a variety
   of stakeholders within a given country. A case study of Cameco, a
   Canadian-based uranium mining multinational which has been operating in
   the politically ``risky{''} country of Kazakhstan for two decades, bears
   this out. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article compares how the global policy of deinstitutionalisation
   (DI) of child welfare travelled, was translated and institutionalised in
   two post-Soviet countries - Russia and Kazakhstan. These countries share
   a Soviet legacy of child-welfare systems dominated by residential care
   and have recently introduced similar DI reforms based on the global
   child rights framework. However, despite similar institutional legacies
   and post-Soviet conditions, the DI reforms have produced different
   outcomes in terms of the scope and pace of the institutionalisation of
   DI policy. In Russia, the DI of child welfare has been a fast-moving and
   sweeping reform, while in Kazakhstan, the implementation of DI has been
   an incremental and gradual process. We argue that the
   institutionalisation of the DI policy in two post-Soviet contexts was an
   outcome of the interplay between structural factors and the agency of
   policy actors who translated global DI ideology into domestic policy
   discourses. Yet, they were `sold' with quite different discursive frames
   - one nationalist, another one trans-nationalist - in these two
   countries. We claim that the geopolitical position of a country is also
   a significant factor for framing and thus, in the end, in how
   child-welfare systems have been reformed.},

Abstract = {The paper features a brief review of the history of Russia's
   colonization of Kazakhstan in the nineteenth century. During this
   period, Russia was engaged in colonial activities in Asia. After
   conquering the Kazakh lands, Russia launched a policy of russification
   and started to force a new sociopolitical model upon the Kazakhs. The
   research investigates the status of the Kazakh population in Russia and
   that of the people who were forced to move to China. The research also
   reviews the attempts of Kazakhs to regain their independence through
   rebellions, which were suppressed violently by imperial armed forces.
   The authors analyzed the works of East Kazakhstani poets in the context
   of the sociocultural processes of that age. The poetic works best
   reflect the mood of the nation and its attitude to the new policy. The
   poems of Arimzhan Zhanuzakuli, Argynbek Apashbayuli, and Nogaybay
   Suleymenuli discover and contemplate the themes that reflect the
   political and social controversies of the age of economic, political,
   and cultural expansion into the country (the theme of disappointment
   with the past and fear of the future) and unite the poets into the
   ``times of tribulation{''} literary trend. The works of the ``times of
   tribulation{''} poets gave impetus to the national rebirth of Kazakhs
   and the return of independence and the possibility to choose their own
   policy. Due to the subjects addressed in their works, many poets were
   subject to purges. Nowadays, the Kazakhs have their own independent
   state of Kazakhstan, which became possible thanks to the national idea
   that was formed in the works of nineteenth-century poets.},

Title = {Adapting Agricultural Water Use to Climate Change in a Post-Soviet

Abstract = {The convergence of climate change and post-Soviet socio-economic and
   institutional transformations has been underexplored so far, as have the
   consequences of such convergence on crop agriculture in Central Asia.
   This paper provides a place-based analysis of constraints and
   opportunities for adaptation to climate change, with a specific focus on
   water use, in two districts in southeast Kazakhstan. Data were collected
   by 2 multi-stakeholder participatory workshops, 21 semi-structured
   in-depth interviews, and secondary statistical data. The present-day
   agricultural system is characterised by enduring Soviet-era management
   structures, but without state inputs that previously sustained
   agricultural productivity. Low margins of profitability on many
   privatised farms mean that attempts to implement integrated water
   management have produced water users associations unable to maintain and
   upgrade a deteriorating irrigation infrastructure. Although actors
   engage in tactical adaptation measures, necessary structural adaptation
   of the irrigation system remains difficult without significant public or
   private investments. Market-based water management models have been
   translated ambiguously to this region, which fails to encourage
   efficient water use and hinders adaptation to water stress. In addition,
   a mutual interdependence of informal networks and formal institutions
   characterises both state governance and everyday life in Kazakhstan.
   Such interdependence simultaneously facilitates operational and tactical
   adaptation, but hinders structural adaptation, as informal networks
   exist as a parallel system that achieves substantive outcomes while
   perpetuating the inertia and incapacity of the state bureaucracy. This
   article has relevance for critical understanding of integrated water
   management in practice and adaptation to climate change in post-Soviet
   institutional settings more broadly.},

Abstract = {The impacts of tourism and reactions of local residents toward tourism

   explores the perceptions of Turkestan (Kazakhstan) residents about
   economic, socio-cultural, and environmental impacts of tourism and their
   support attitudes toward tourism development. Findings underline that
   perceptions of social and environmental impacts were not clear and
   support to tourism development is basically related to economic issues,
   indicating that if the locals are economically active in the tourism
   sector, they would support more. The study has importance since it

Abstract = {Purpose - Since its independence, Kazakhstan has been improving its
   corporate governance system according to recommendations of
   international organizations. It was promised that the adoption of
   shareholder primacy approach would have a positive impact on its
   financial market growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   quantitatively analyse whether Kazakhstani corporate governance is
   moving towards a shareholder primacy corporate governance approach and
   its impact on financial market growth.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper will conduct a quantitative
   analysis. Firstly, the changes in corporate governance that occurred
   between 1991 and 2017 will be analysed using 52 corporate governance
   variables. Thus, a questionnaire will be used to collect data. When the
   questionnaire is completed, all data will be converted into numbers.
   Then, multiple liner regression will be used to estimate the impact of
   change in corporate governance.
   Findings - The paper finds that Kazakhstan is successfully adopting
   shareholder-friendly corporate governance standards and so-called
   convergence has also occurred. Moreover, it is suggested that reforms in
   Kazakhstani corporate governance system have not yet brought the desired
   result of prosperous financial market and high flows of foreign
   investments.
   Originality/value - Analysis specifically considers the changes in
   Kazakhstani corporate governance system and uses quantitative methods,
   whereas there is a lack (if not complete absence) of quantitative
   studies regarding Kazakhstani corporate governance.},

   Independent contemporary artists of the post-Soviet period form new
   artistic movements, such as Punk Shamanism in Kazakhstan, to produce
   alternative truth and authentic discourses on nation and its history.
   This production is juxtaposed to the production of state-sponsored
   artists and writers. The article focuses on this struggle for defining
   the nation and claiming power in the discursive realm. It contributes to
   further conceptualization of the power of contemporary artists and
   non-state-sponsored cultural elites to participate in the processes of
   alternative and powerful discourses on nation and national imagination
   that become successful domestically and abroad. Through the discussion
   and production of Punk Shamanism - a new wave of cultural production
   identified with the search for lost memory and cultural codes, the
   article demonstrates how this cultural struggle developed in post-1991
   Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Microfinance is seen as an important vehicle for developing small
   businesses in developing and transitional economies despite the relative
   absence of supporting research. We use mixed methods to offer a nuanced
   empirical exploration of the relationship between microfinance and
   everyday entrepreneurial practice(s) in Kazakhstan. As in many
   transitional contexts, `unbankable' borrowers here operate in a vibrant
   informal sector, face high degrees of uncertainty, and retain a strong
   distrust of a corrupt/predatory state. Our data-based methodology for
   analysing borrowers' diverse relationships with microfinance
   organisations (MFOs) generates insights into their multiple pathways to
   business development. Both `outreac\textbackslash{}h' and
   `commercialised' MFOs sustain micro-flows of resources that are critical
   for everyday entrepreneurs who need to finance ongoing consumption and
   contingencies whilst also (and by) building up their small businesses.
   Microfinance use did not promote formalisation or impersonalised banking
   relationships. Instead, MFOs focused primarily on repayment, clients'
   businesses remained partially formalised or unregistered across all
   stages of growth and the lending relationships preferred by Private MFOs
   and borrowers were highly personalised. Consequently, we call for
   assumptions about how microfinance can (and should) drive small business
   development need to be rethought for transitional contexts.},

Abstract = {This report presents a summary of the 2011 and 2012 excavations of the

   city of Taraz, located near the southern border with Uzbekistan, is one
   of the most significant historic settlements in Kazakhstan, and the
   investigations in the central market place have started to reveal the
   composition of the medieval city. Despite frequent mentions in Arabic
   and Chinese written sources, the form and evolution of this important
   Silk Road city remains poorly understood. These excavations, which
   identified a series of buildings including a bathhouse and a fire
   shrine, are the first for almost 50 years and include the first C-14
   radiocarbon date from the city. In addition, this is one of the first
   detailed accounts in English of an urban excavation in Kazakhstan. (C)

Journal = {ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION},

Pages = {691-731},
Abstract = {This study compares the individual, household and location
   characteristics of private employees, the self-employed, the unemployed
   and the economically inactive in Kazakhstan making use of a 1996 World
   Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey. The purpose is to understand
   whether the process of transition has determined a selection of workers
   exiting the state sector and entering the three relatively new `pools'
   of private employees, self-employed and unemployed. An `occupational
   choice' model is used to explore the determinants of sector
   participation. It is found that income opportunities are similar between
   the private and self-employment sectors, that the private sector is not
   necessarily the workers' first choice and that non-income determinants
   including local economic and labour market conditions and household
   related factors explain better than income the choice of the working
   sector. Self-employment seems to be a key sector in understanding the
   mechanisms of sector choice and the reallocation of labour. Unemployment
   appears as a choice of last resort and made by truly `rationed'
   individuals. JEL classification: J22, J23, J24, P20.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the June 2010 violence in southern Kyrgyzstan, much
   scholarly attention has focused on its causes. However, observers have
   taken little notice of the fact that while such urban areas as Osh,
   Jalal-Abad, and Bazar-Korgon were caught up in violence, some towns in
   southern Kyrgyzstan that were close to the conflict sites and had
   considerable conflict potential had managed to avoid the violence. Thus,
   while the question, ``What were the causes of the June 2010
   violence?{''} is important, we have few answers to the question, ``Why
   did the conflict break out in some places but not others with similar
   conflict potential?{''} Located in the theoretical literature on ``the
   local turn{''} within peacekeeping studies, this article is based on
   extensive empirical fieldwork to explore the local and micro-level
   dimensions of peacekeeping. It seeks to understand why and how local
   leaders and residents in some places in southern Kyrgyzstan managed to
   prevent the deadly clashes associated with Osh, Jalal-Abad, and
   Bazar-Korgon. The main focus of the project is on Aravan, a town with a
   mixed ethnic population where residents managed to avert interethnic
   clashes during the June 2010 unrest. The answers to the question of why
   violence did not occur can yield important lessons for conflict
   management not only for southern Kyrgyzstan, but also for the entire
   Central Asian region.},

Title = {Agricultural Policies and Technical Efficiency of Wheat Production in
   Kazakhstan and Russia: Evidence from a Stochastic Frontier Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND APPLIED ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {We utilize a unique primary data set of farms in Russia and Kazakhstan
   to investigate the link between policy reforms and technical efficiency.
   These countries have heavily subsidized their domestic agricultural
   production over the last decade, with a total of around USD 76 billion
   USD and USD 11.5 billion USD in government funding directed towards the
   agricultural sectors in Russia and Kazakhstan, respectively. Results of
   a stochastic frontier analysis make evident that variable inputs, such
   as fertilizer, have a relatively large influence on wheat production
   compared to land. Nearly every fifth farm has a technical efficiency
   level lower than 60\%, suggesting significant unrealized production
   potential. While our analysis shows a negative relation between
   subsidies and efficiency, other factors, such as farmer's education,
   cooperative and agroholding membership, and participation in insurance
   programs, are positively related to farm efficiency. The results imply
   that the governments and policymakers could mobilize the unutilized
   wheat production potential by improving the farmer education system,
   fostering cooperation among farms, and developing functioning farm
   insurance schemes.},

Title = {Challenges for the sustainable use of water and land resources under a
   changing climate and increasing salinization in the Jizzakh irrigation
   zone of Uzbekistan},

Abstract = {Jizzakh Province in Uzbekistan is one of the largest irrigated areas in
   Central Asia without natural drainage. In combination with aridity,
   climate change and extensive irrigation practices, this has led to the
   widespread salinization of agricultural land. The aim of this study was
   to identify opportunities to improve the reclamation status of the
   irrigated area and how best to effectively use the water resources in
   Jizzakh Province based on investigations conducted between 1995 and
   2016. A database of field measurements of groundwater levels,
   mineralization and soil salinity conducted by the provincial
   Hydro-Geological Reclamation Expeditions was used in the study. The
   total groundwater mineralization was determined using a portable
   electric conductometer (Progress 1T) and the chloride concentration was
   determined using the Mohr method. The soil salinity analyses were
   conducted by applying two different methods: (1) the extraction and
   assessment of the soluble salt content, and (2) using an SM-138
   conductivity sensor applied to a 1:1 mixture of soil sample and water.
   The analyses of the monitoring results and the salt balance in the
   ``irrigation water-soil-drainage water{''} system clearly demonstrated
   that the condition of the irrigated land in the province was not
   significantly improved. Under these conditions, the stability of crop
   yields is achieved mainly through the use of large volumes of
   fertilizer. However, excess amounts of mineral fertilizers can also
   cause the salinization of soils. The average groundwater salinization
   value in most of the irrigated land (75.3\%) fluctuated between 1.1 and
   5.0 g/L, while the values were less than 1.0 g/L in 13.1\% of the land
   and in the range of 5.1-10.0 g/L in 10.5\% of the land. During the
   period of 1995-2016 the salinization level of the irrigated land in
   Jizzakh Province increased slightly and the area could be divided into
   the following classes: no salinity (17.7\% of the total area), low
   salinity (51.3\%), moderate salinity (29.0\%), and high salinity
   (2.0\%). Detailed studies of the salt balance in irrigated land, the
   impact of climate change, increased fertilizer use, and repeated
   remediation leaching on the groundwater level and mineralization should
   be conducted in the future, due to the possibility of accelerated
   salinization, fertility decline, and reduced yields of agricultural
   crops.},

   Associations in the Republic of Tajikistan},
Journal = {WATER},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Development initiatives often cite Water Users' Associations (WUAs) as
   fundamental to water governance reform or the broad process of
   decentralizing responsibilities for management, supply and delivery. But
   the label of ``WUA{''} indicates little about those who take on these
   duties as association members, suggesting all who use water in pursuit
   of life or livelihood are eligible to participate and benefit through
   collective action. Grounded in the belief that participatory projects
   can equitably empower and distribute resources, the enthusiastic
   introduction of WUAs continues despite critique that anticipated
   outcomes are overstated. Since borders opened to neoliberal development
   institutions in the 1990s, WUAs have been created throughout post-Soviet
   Central Asia. Yet, there has been limited reflection on how
   associations' design and operation interact with physical or social
   structures to effect resource access across diverse groups. Drawing on
   fieldwork in Tajikistan, I demonstrate how WUAs reproduce exclusionary
   outcomes by requiring members to possess farmland in turn threatening
   rural food security. Held by a minority, farmland dedicated to
   commercial production stands in contrast to ubiquitous kitchen gardens,
   where crops sown for self-consumption form a buffer against hunger in
   the wake of labor migration and income inconsistency. Households'
   inability to become members undermines their claim to water and voice in
   decision-making, ultimately constraining access to irrigation and a
   robust harvest.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to study debt sustainability of countries
   with a resource-based economy on the example of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Macroeconomic indicators and data on external and internal public debt
   of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation for the period
   from 2007 to 2019 were analyzed using quantitative, qualitative,
   comparative, descriptive and graphical methods. Based on the collected
   data, the indicators were calculated, analyzed and compared, taking into
   account the threshold values, using The Debt Sustainability Framework
   for Low-Income Countries of the International Monetary Fund and the
   World Bank.
   Findings
   The results of the study showed that the indicators of the public debt
   of both the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, during
   the period covered by the study, were in the zone of reduced risk and
   were stable. In addition, the study revealed a slight shift in the
   structure of the public debt of the Republic of Kazakhstan toward a
   decrease in the share of domestic borrowing (from 67\% to 55\%), whereas
   in the structure of the Russian public debt, the share of domestic
   borrowing increased significantly (from 52\% to 74\%).
   Originality/value
   The results of this study can be applied by scientists to analyze the
   sustainability of public debt in various countries and regions, as well
   as by officials to determine the fiscal and budgetary policies of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, as well as other
   states.},

Abstract = {An entrepreneurial ecosystem's role in emergent organisations'
   environments is crucial. This research presents a dynamic view of
   entrepreneurial ecosystems by exploring an external shock faced by a
   migrant woman entrepreneur in Kazakhstan. By examining the pre-shock,
   shock, and post-shock phases, we reveal how the external shock altered
   the balance of elements in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and how
   uncertainties related to such an exogeneous shock can be overcome in
   cooperation with other ecosystem actors. By focusing on a migrant woman
   entrepreneur, we demonstrate that the opportunity presented by an
   external shock is exploited through the unique competitive advantage of
   each ecosystem's actor, manifesting in complementarity among the actors,
   whereas the aim of attaining the envisioned joint value proposition acts
   as a cohering tool among the entrepreneurial ecosystem's elements. In
   addition, complementarity and coherence among an entrepreneurial
   ecosystem's elements co-create ecosystem resilience and generate
   additional opportunities that entrepreneurs might exploit.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that ambivalent gender attitudes are
   associated with attitudes toward homosexuals. However, most of these
   studies have primarily considered ambivalent attitudes toward women and

   connection between ambivalent attitudes toward men and women and
   attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women in countries with
   conservative sexual legislation. In the first study, participants were
   residents of Russia (N = 163) and Kazakhstan (N = 194), while the second
   study used residents of Russia (N = 496) and Belarus (N = 123). Results
   indicated that benevolent attitudes predicted attitudes toward gays and
   lesbians better than the hostile ones. At the same time, attitudes
   toward men and women similarly predicted attitudes toward gays and
   lesbians. These patterns were manifested among different components of
   attitudes toward homosexuals. The results are discussed within the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {123-134},
Abstract = {The energy demands of the construction sector are expected to multiply
   over the next decade, driven by population growth, rising incomes,
   accelerating urbanization and changes in consumption patterns. This
   process is also dramatically affected by the depletion of fossil
   resources and high specific energy consumption for heating buildings.
   Under these conditions, it is necessary to develop comprehensive energy
   efficiency measures in these areas to meet the energy demands of
   residential, commercial and administrative buildings. In this work,
   using the methods of degree-day, multicriteria optimization and
   regression analysis, the optimal combinations of factors for an
   unventilated Trombe wall are determined: the orientation of the
   building, the thermal support of the translucent enclosure of the
   unventilated Trombe wall and the ratio of the surface of the
   unventilated Trombe wall to the surface of the building facade. The
   calculations were performed for three levels of thermal protection for
   buildings in the climatic conditions of the city of Tashkent
   (Uzbekistan). A typical one-storey three-room house was chosen as the
   object. As the calculation results show, within the considered range of
   values, the relative dominances of the factors are as follows:
   orientation -5.37\%; thermal support of translucent barriers -72.95\%;
   and area ratio -21.68\%. Using the optimal values, the specific energy
   consumption of buildings for heating can be reduced from an average of
   12.9-14.8\% to 52.6-65.3\%. Additionally, the CO2 emissions are reduced
   from 5621.8 kg to 12435.5 kg per year. The discounted payback period,
   depending on the investment, ranges from 18.7 to 40.9 years. Regression
   equations are proposed for three levels of thermal protection of the
   considered object, making it possible to determine the specific energy
   consumption for heating.},

Title = {Do Hybrid Legal Systems Matter in Foreign Legal-Aid Programmes? Some
   Philosophical Aspects of Legal Aid in Uzbekistan as Provided by the

Abstract = {Since the fall of socialism in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union,
   and some states of Southeast Asia, the international financial
   institutions and individual donor states have initiated wide-scale
   legal-aid programmes to assist these states in their transition from
   socialism to a market economy. Whereas the aid from financial
   institutions vis-a-vis recipient states is often agreed upon specific
   conditionalities, the donor states design their foreign legal aid
   according to individual preferences, although sometimes with references
   to universal goals. Currently, various donor states provide legal aid to
   Uzbekistan. Given the fact that Uzbekistan is the former Soviet Republic
   that still bears multiple traces of a socialist legal system and
   additionally integrates indigenous informal law, this research provides
   an analysis of how different donor states base their legal-aid
   activities on entirely different philosophies and levels of gravity, and
   how receptive the hybrid structure of Uzbekistan's law is towards such
   aid.},

Abstract = {The study of hydrogeological structures and the establishment of the
   relation between surface river water and groundwater. The processes of
   underground recharging of rivers during the low water season contribute
   to the preservation of the natural balance of ecosystems, ensuring the
   normal state of the vegetation cover of the adjacent territories, biota
   survival and reproduction. The interrelation between surface and
   groundwater of different geomorphological regions is shown; these
   regions are represented by mountain, piedmont and flat relief.
   Regularities in the groundwater formation and the influence of relation
   to river systems surface runoff on them have been established. Such a
   relation helps to maintain the ecosystem ecological stability in arid
   climate conditions, by redistributing the water runoff of
   hydrogeological systems with the aquifers of river valleys alluvial
   deposits. During this period the preservation of water exchange between
   the groundwater aquifers of river valleys alluvial deposits and
   overlying water-bearing formations makes it possible to maintain a
   stable state of the surrounding natural environment due to water
   exchange. A flow diagram of the interrelation between the individual
   elements of the water balance of the active water exchange zone
   (precipitation, water infiltration in the aeration zone, firstly from
   the surface of the aquifers, sloping on-site and groundwater runoff
   etc.) is presented for illustrative purposes in this work. Separately, a
   methodology is given for studying and carrying out quantitative
   assessment of the interrelation between river and groundwater in the
   features of the of groundwater runoff formation.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {One of the lingering legacies of the Cold War was the enormous nuclear
   arsenals amassed by the two superpowers. When one of them, the Soviet
   Union, disintegrated in 1991, its nearly 30,000 nuclear weapons were
   located on the territory of not one but four newly sovereign states:
   Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. Although
   command-and-control of Soviet strategic missiles was centralized in
   Moscow, the specter of the single largest wave of horizontal nuclear
   proliferation loomed after 1991. By 1994, however, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
   and Ukraine had decided to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
   (NPT) as non-nuclear weapons states and to give up the missiles on their
   soil. Drawing on previously untapped archival records, this article
   reconstructs the divergent paths of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine
   toward relinquishing their armaments. A combination of domestic and
   international political factors contributed to the resolution of the
   problem. Among the various contributing factors, the NPT stands out as a
   salient force that provided normative framing and guided deliberations
   on post-Soviet nuclear disarmament.},

Title = {Middle- and secondary-school students' STEM career interest and its

Journal = {SCIENCE EDUCATION},

Volume = {107},

Abstract = {Despite pervasive educational efforts, student interest in STEM careers
   continues to decline in many countries. The present study seeks to
   better understand this phenomenon by examining how internal factors
   (gender) and external factors (school grades, grade level, family size)
   relate to Kazakh students' STEM career interests. To this end, a newly
   developed instrument (STEM Career Interest Survey) based on social
   cognitive career theory was used to assess interest in STEM careers
   among middle- and secondary students in Kazakhstan. The survey was
   completed by a sample of 396 Kazakh students in grades 7 to 12. Our
   statistical analyses revealed that (1) female students were generally
   less interested in STEM careers than male students; (2) students with
   higher grades in physics classes were significantly more interested in
   STEM careers than low-performing students; (3) students at higher grade
   levels were generally more interested in STEM careers than those in
   lower grade levels; (4) the number of siblings was positively associated
   with student interest in mathematics careers; and, (5) family support
   and role models were significantly correlated with student STEM career
   interest. Our findings suggest that student development of interest in
   STEM careers constitutes an epigenetic phenomenon that involves complex
   interactions between internal factors (e.g., self-efficacy) and external
   factors (e.g., gender stereotypes). Based on this, it is argued that the
   promotion of student interest in STEM careers is a multifaceted problem
   whose resolution requires, among other things, dispelling stereotypes in
   students' sociocultural context through systematic renegotiation of
   traditional gender-technology relations characteristic of a country's
   culture.},

   2010 to 2015. The number of indexed multidisciplinary and medical

   this can be due to the adoption of the new Law on Science in that year.
   Several regulatory legal acts have been issued in recent years aimed at
   improving the quality of local journals and the international
   recognition of academic degrees and titles. Publication activity of
   scientific authors from Kazakhstan was found to be higher than that from
   other countries in the Central Asian region. However, there are still
   many unresolved issues related to the English language barrier, lack of
   indexing status of local journals, and poor topical education on science
   writing and editing. As such, the number of articles published in
   `predatory' journals remains sizable, and there are concerns over
   authors' negligence and plagiarism. The global solution to the discussed
   problems may be achieved by educating researchers, authors, reviewers,

Abstract = {Constant environmental degradation and increased frequency and severity
   of natural disasters have been evident over the past few decades
   worldwide. As such, scientific tools to predict and assess risks keep
   being developed. Assessing disaster risk is an important task in
   supporting the transition to a sustainable society. However, as
   disasters and systems become more complex, disaster models combining
   diverse aspects including climatic, social, economic, and environmental
   factors are necessary. For this study, we set a model using the concept
   of risk by identifying hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. Here, the
   vulnerability was classified into two domains, sensitivity and adaptive
   capacity, and two spheres, natural/built environment and human
   environment. Also, we stressed that controllable geo-spatial indicators
   should be included in risk assessments to effectively reduce risk and
   implement adequate spatio-temporal actions. The approach of this study
   was applied to Kazakhstan and South Korea as a pilot study to develop
   Agricultural Drought Risk Index (ADRI) and maps. As a result, the
   agricultural drought risk could be analyzed for South Korea and
   Kazakhstan. In addition, we performed additional spatial analyses at a
   reasonable scale for practical use. It was concluded that prioritizing
   risk areas at administrative and site level could contribute in decision
   and policy-making for risk reduction. Furthermore, spatial data
   availability and quality were found to be significant in assessing
   disaster risk.},

Abstract = {The results of ecological monitoring of the status of springs in Western
   Kazakhstan are presented: three of these springs are located in the
   Atyrau region and twelve are located in the Western Kazakhstan Region.
   The following properties of spring water samples were determined in
   accordance with water quality hygiene standards of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan (RK) and the Russian Federation (RF): temperature, pH, debit,
   turbidity, total hardness, permanganate index, solid residue, total
   spring mineralization, content of dissolved oxygen, cations (ammonium,
   calcium, magnesium, sodium, and pot assium), anions (nitrites, nitrates,
   carbonates, hydrocarbonates, chlorides, sulphates, and polyphosphates),
   heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, iron, chrome, manganese,
   cobalt, and nickel), petrochemicals, and phenols. The microbiological
   indicators of the waters (total microbial number, total coliform
   bacteria, and thermotolerant coliform bacteria) and spring bacterial
   contamination factors were determined. All springs were found to have
   small debits except the Tilepbulak spring in the Atyrausk region, which
   was a semi-debit. The water of almost all springs studied was neutral
   except the Ainabulak spring in the Western Kazakhstan region, the water
   of which was weakly acidic and did not meet the standard indicators of
   the RF and RK. The sprigs studied differed by their hydrochemical
   indicators. The water in most of the springs and did not meet the
   hygienic standards of the RF and RK. In all the springs of the Atyraus
   region, the contents of iron, chrome, manganese, nickel, and phenol
   exceeded the hygienic standards. In the water of Ashituzbulak spring,
   the content of petrochemicals slightly exceeded accepted standards. High
   iron concentrations were found in two springs of the Western Kazakhstan
   region (Taskal-5, Serebryakov). The chrome concentration was high in six
   springs (Taskal-5, Krasnenkoye, Tsiganovo-2 (Yegendibulak), Bol'shaia
   Itchka, Ainabulak, Serebryakov). The manganese content was high in two
   springs (Taskal-1, Serebryakov). The nickel content high was in four
   springs (Taskal-5, Krasnenkoye, Bol'shaia Itchka, Ainabulak,
   Serebryakov). The phenol content was high in five springs (Taskal-5,
   Krasnenkoye, Tsiganovo-2 (Yegendibulak), Bol'shaya Itchka, Ainabulak).
   In the springs of the Atyraus and Western Kazakhstan regions, no
   deviations from the hygienic standards were found. The instability of
   microbiological indicators of the water was due to the fact that most of
   the springs studied were located near human settlements and actively
   used for domestic purposes and consumption by farm animals. This paper
   suggests practical recommendations for the rational use of springs in
   Western Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the delegation of economic policy implementation
   in non-democratic settings. It draws on a dataset of statutory and
   administrative regulation created between 1991 and 2011 in Kazakhstan in
   order to investigate economic effects of bureaucratic discretion. The
   examination of regional and temporal variation in the number and detail
   of economic regulations shows that while regulatory intervention does
   not have a discernible effect on economic performance, statutory
   constraints on bureaucratic discretion have a positive effect. This
   finding supports the notion that in the absence of societal
   accountability, statutory constraint on the administrative apparatus
   leads to a more stable business climate and better economic performance.
   The paper explicates the ways in which theories of delegation apply to
   autocracies and broadens our understanding of political control over
   economic policy implementation.},

Title = {Investigating the energy transition to a coal free residential sector in
   Kazakhstan using a regionally disaggregated energy systems model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {196},
Pages = {1532-1548},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Problems with unsustainable use of energy by households and lack of
   access to energy infrastructure require effective actions from the
   policy makers. Energy system models can usefully analyze future
   residential sector energy pathways ``within{''} the full energy system.
   However, few energy system models have been developed with disaggregated
   sub-national regional detail, building type and urban/rural divisions.
   This paper addresses this key gap. Disaggregating the residential sector
   by building categories allows improved representation of the range of
   energy transition options across building categories. We incorporated a
   novel detailed building stock module into a 16-region TIMES energy
   systems model for Kazakhstan, using statistical data on the housing
   stock and building energy audit reports. We then explore the
   introduction of a coal ban and use scenario analysis to identify the
   most cost-effective heating technologies for the different regions and
   different building types. Implications of the residential sector
   policies to the supply side energy infrastructure were also quantified.
   The energy transition (from solid fuels to cleaner alternatives) is
   rarely achievable without Government intervention, therefore scenarios
   with ban on coal use and clean energy technology subsidies (micro-CHP,
   heat pumps and solar space heaters) have been investigated in this
   study. The results indicate that in rural areas networked gas (for
   detached households) and district heating (for flats) are more
   economically viable substitutes to coal, even with subsidies offered for
   clean technologies. In the scenario with the constraint on gas network
   expansion and clean technology subsidies, there is a wide utilization of
   heat pumps in detached rural houses. Subsidies for retrofit measures are
   effective with wide utilization, especially in the areas affected by the
   coal ban, with up to 76\% reduction of the useful energy demand. The
   total amount of allocated subsidies for clean technologies amounted for
   up to 32\% and 8\% of the current state social and health care
   expenditures. A coal ban in the residential sector is estimated to
   achieve emissions reductions for PM2.5 and CO of 92\% and 95\%,
   respectively (compared to the base year level), even accounting for
   emissions from the supply side (power plants, heat plants). (C). 2018

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID LAND},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Fossil energy is the material basis of human survival, economic
   development and social progress. The relationship between energy
   consumption and economic growth is becoming increasingly close. However,
   energy consumption is the major source of greenhouse gases, which can
   significantly affect the balance of the global ecosystem. It has become
   the common goal of countries worldwide to address climate change, reduce
   carbon dioxide emissions, and implement sustainable development
   strategies. In this study, we applied an approximate relationship
   analysis, a decoupling relationship analysis, and a trend analysis to
   explore the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth
   using data from Kazakhstan for the period of 1993-2010. The results
   demonstrated: (1) the total energy consumption and GDP in Kazakhstan
   showed a ``U{''}-type curve from 1993 to 2010. This curve was observed
   because 1993-1999 was a period during which Kazakhstan transitioned from
   a republic to an independent country and experienced a difficult
   transition from a planned to a market economy. Then, the economic system
   became more stable and the industrial production increased rapidly
   because of the effective financial, monetary and industrial policy
   support from 2000 to 2010. (2) The relationships between energy
   consumption and carbon emissions, economic growth and energy exports
   were linked; the carbon emissions were mainly derived from energy
   consumption, and the dependence of economic growth on energy exports
   gradually increased from 1993 to 2010. Before 2000, the relationship
   between energy consumption and economic growth was in a recessional
   decoupling state because of the economic recession. After 2000, this
   relationship was in strong and weak decoupling states because the
   international crude oil prices rose and energy exports increased greatly
   year by year. (3) It is forecasted that Kazakhstan cannot achieve its
   goal of energy consumption by 2020. Therefore, a low-carbon economy is
   the best strategic choice to address climate change from a global
   perspective in Kazakhstan. Thus, we proposed strategies including the
   improvement of the energy consumption structure, the development of new
   energy and renewable energy, the use of cleaner production technologies,
   the adjustment and optimization of the industrial structure, and the
   expansion of forest areas.},

Abstract = {In this ethnographic study, I explore the experiences of academic
   mothers who are international faculty in a highly internationalized

   observations, interviews, and auto-ethnography, I analyze how
   international female faculty perform their work and function within
   their family roles in the context of ambiguous overlapping cultural
   norms about gender roles and motherhood responsibilities. This study
   reveals that the participants could successfully combine and
   simultaneously enjoy their work and family lives. Moreover, these women
   could shape the emerging organizational culture of this relatively new
   higher educational institution in ways that are supportive of female
   faculty and student mothers. I use the cultural brokerage theory to
   explain the agentic capacity of female faculty and the way in which the
   theory may extend the previously used feminist performativity theory as
   a lens through which to investigate the transformative capacity of women

Title = {Mechanisms for Forming IT-clusters as ``Growth Poles{''} in Regions of
   Kazakhstan on the Way to ``Industry 4.0{''}},
Journal = {ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {212-224},
Abstract = {The main prerequisite for successful innovative development is the
   natural course of modernization of world industries, currently
   characterized by the transition to ``Industry 4.0{''}, where the main
   driver is information technology (including digital). With regard to the
   Kazakhstan economy, the emphasis is increased according to the Message
   of the President of Khazakhstan Nazarbayev N.A. to the people of
   Kazakhstan ``The Third Modernization of Kazakhstan: Global
   Competitiveness{''}, dated 31.01.2017. He delivered ``the first priority
   - accelerated technological modernization of the economy{''}. At the
   same time, an important aspect of accelerated technological
   modernization is the provision that it is important ``to cultivate new
   industries that are created with the use of digital technology{''}. The
   purpose for the article is to develop scientific and practical
   recommendations and effective organizational and economic mechanisms to
   form IT-clusters in the regions of Kazakhstan on the way to ``Industry
   4.0{''}. Within the framework of the set goal the following main
   objectives are addressed: research the concept of ``growth poles{''} and
   the possibility of its use in the formation of an IT-cluster; study the
   effect of local factors on the IT-cluster formation; present
   organizational and economic mechanisms to form IT-clusters amid the
   transition to ``Industry 4.0{''}. The fundamental difference between the
   ideas of this research from the existing similar ones lies in the fact
   that we formulate and propose scientific provisions concerning the
   formation of IT-clusters in Kazakhstan, expand the existing knowledge
   about the development of digital technology, green information and
   communication technology and the introduction of breakthrough smart
   projects in IT. The proposed scientific research applies general
   research methods which help explore and organize the available data
   through theoretical and practical analysis. In particular, the article
   implies the application of the following general research methods:
   generalization (establishing common properties and characteristics of
   clusters; any features can be identified (abstract-general) or
   essential); system analysis (study based on review of clusters as an
   integral set of elements in the set of relations and connections between
   them); simulation. The article proposes the mechanisms to form
   IT-clusters as growth poles in the medium and long term, taking into
   account the requirements of the four-stage model of IT-cluster formation
   and development (a strictly defined sequence).},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Solid waste management is one of the main problems in large cities. The
   determination of the quantitative and qualitative composition of
   municipal solid waste is necessary for proper planning in the processing
   of such waste. This article presents the results of studies of the
   morphological composition, physico-chemical parameters and energetical
   potential of municipal solid waste (MSW) from the landfill of the city
   of Shymkent. Waste samples were taken from 10 different points of the
   landfill. The volume-mass parameters of the samples and their average
   density were determined. The combined waste samples mainly consisted of
   food waste, paper and cardboard, polymers and plastic, glass, metal,
   textiles, wood, leather, bones and rubber. Most of the waste, more than
   30\%, contains plastic products. The moisture of the combustible
   fraction of the samples is low and varies from 0.3\% to 2.3\%. The
   average ash content of the combustible fraction of the samples was
   determined and its average value is 18.4\%. The yield of the volatile
   substances was determined and the average value per dry state is 78.7\%.
   To determine the energetical potential of municipal solid waste, the
   gross calorific value was determined and the net calorific value was
   calculated, the average value of which is 24.15 MJ/kg. This shows the
   possibility of using solid waste as an energy source.},

Abstract = {The rural out-migration of young people leads to problems such as
   ``brain drain{''} and the overageing of the rural population. The
   purpose of this paper is to study return migration motives among
   students originating from rural areas. The case study relates to the
   province of Akmola, northern Kazakhstan. Based on data collected from
   college and university students (n = 357), a binary logistic regression
   model is used to identify rural return motives. Noneconomic and economic
   motives are equally important in forming a return intention. Our
   findings do not suggest that particularly underperforming students
   intend to return. As expected, compared with those in major cities,
   students who study in a regional town intend to return more often. We
   also found a large difference in return intentions along ethnic lines.
   Students of non-Kazakh decent are much more likely to return than ethnic
   Kazakhs, and the two ethnic groups have quite distinct motives
   indicating signs of ethnic discrimination against non-Kazakhs in the job
   market.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the experience in reforming the education system in
   the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan in order to
   identify the requirements for the federal state standards of general
   education in Russia and the state compulsory standard of general
   secondary education in Kazakhstan, ensuring the preservation of the
   national interests of these countries developing in the context of
   expanding educational globalization. The following tasks have been
   solved: analyze the historical experience of the development of the
   Federal state educational standards and the State compulsory standard of
   general secondary education in Kazakhstan; evaluate the results of the
   introduction in Russia - the Unified state exam, and in Kazakhstan - the
   Unified national testing; determine the feasibility of introducing such
   definitions as ``Mandatory minimum{''}, ``requirements for the level of
   training of graduates (students){''}, ``basic curriculum{''},
   ``educational program of an educational organization{''}, ``system of
   gauges{''}, ``standard of the school subject{''}, ``school
   component{''}, ``a mandatory part of the main educational program{''},
   etc.; to identify the main directions of further development of the
   Federal state educational standards and the State compulsory standard of
   general secondary education in Kazakhstan. Based on the analysis of the
   Law of the Russian Federation ``On education{''}, Concept of federal
   components of the state educational standard of primary general, basic
   general and secondary (complete) general education, Federal Law ``On
   education in the Russian Federation{''}, General concept of federal
   components of the state educational standard of primary general, basic
   general and secondary (complete) general education and others, as well
   as the relevant policy documents of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the
   authors propose to the public to answer the following questions: ``Do
   modern secondary schools need state standards in the ideas about them
   that have accumulated in our countries over the past decades?{''}; ``On
   the presence of content (in its classical sense ``what to learn{''}) in
   the standard{''}. What should be included in the text of the new
   standards will be possible to determine only on the basis of a
   comprehensive discussion of this issue in society and among the

Title = {Improving the effectiveness of senior graders' education based on the
   development of mathematical intuition and logic: Kazakhstan's experience},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Mathematical learning in many developing nations is below average due to
   which students face difficulties in solving the equations and problems
   of mathematics as a result of limited understanding of the main concepts
   and reliance upon intuition as well as memorization. This study is
   focused on analyzing the effectiveness of senior graders' education
   based on the development of mathematical intuition and logic in the
   context of Kazakhstan's educational system. The quantitative research
   method and primary data sources were used for this research with a 147
   sample size, which was selected by using a random strategy of sampling.
   With the use of IBM SPSS STATISTICS for data analysis, it was concluded
   that mathematical intuition and logic have a positive influence on the
   effectiveness of a student's education. Effective strategies, such as
   rote learning instructions, problem-based learning, RME approach,
   mathematical reasoning, etc., are essential for enhancing the
   capabilities of studies in learning mathematics. It is found that there
   is a significant and positive association between student effectiveness
   and the logical reasoning abilities of students. Additionally, a
   positive and moderate relationship is noticed between the critical
   thinking of students, problem-solving abilities of students, and student
   effectiveness. Nevertheless, the main limitation of this study is that
   with small sample size, the findings of the study cannot be generalized;
   therefore, a large sample size would increase the reliability of the
   results in the future research. However, in the context of Kazakhstan,
   this study potentially contributes to the existing literature by
   presenting conclusive findings in the context of mathematical logic and
   intuition and student effectiveness.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate sustainable trade between China and

   the importer and exporter relative to the distance to other trading
   partners, rather than the absolute distance, significantly negatively
   impacts trade volumes. Other factors, such as the structure and
   availability of free trade zones and unobservable factors related to the
   characteristics of the checkpoints, also affect trade volumes. To obtain
   these results, we derive an extended gravity model that considers
   spatial effects and specific features of the trade between China and
   Kazakhstan. Thus, we contribute to the fundamental foundations of
   gravity models.},

Abstract = {Based on essence of the stakeholder and resource dependence theories,
   this study examines relationships between corporate board
   characteristics and sustainability reporting (SR) in oil, gas and mining
   companies in Kazakhstan. All data on board characteristics and SR were
   collected manually from annual reports, investment memorandums,
   sustainability reports, and corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   reports, while financial data were extracted from. financial statements
   of the companies. The results show that board characteristics such as
   board size and gender diversity are the most important factors in
   determining the scope and quality of sustainability information. The
   findings of the study will be useful for investors, policy makers,
   regulators and practitioners, as they suggest that effective board
   characteristics could improve corporate governance (CG) practices,
   which, in turn, could lead to more transparent and better corporate
   reporting practices in emerging economies generally and the 15 former
   USSR countries specifically. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of the impact factors in energy-related CO2
   emissions serves as an important guide for reducing carbon emissions and
   building an environmentally-friendly society. This paper aims to use
   LMDI method and a modified STIRPAT model to research the conventional
   energy-related CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan after the collapse of the
   Soviet Union. The results show that the trajectory of CO2 emissions
   displayed U-shaped curve from 1992 to 2013. Based on the extended Kaya
   identity and additive LMDI method, we decomposed total CO2 emissions
   into four influencing factors. Of those, the economic active effect is
   the most influential factor driving CO2 emissions, which produced 110.86
   Mt CO2 emissions, with a contribution rate of 43.92\%. The second
   driving factor is the population effect, which led to 11.87 Mt CO2
   emissions with a contribution rate of 4.7\%. On the contrary, the energy
   intensity effect is the most inhibiting factor, which caused-110.90 Mt
   CO2 emissions with a contribution rate of-43.94\%, followed by the
   energy carbon structure effect resulting in-18.76 Mt CO2 emissions with
   a contribution rate of-7.43\%. In order to provide an in-depth
   examination of the change response between energy-related CO2 emissions
   and each impact factor, we construct a modified STIRPAT model based on
   ridge regression estimation. The results indicate that for every 1\%
   increase in population size, economic activity, energy intensity and
   energy carbon structure, there is a subsequent increase in CO2 emissions
   of 3.13\%, 0.41\%, 0.30\% and 0.63\%, respectively.},

   whether the classic centre of gravity test may be the appropriate way to
   determine the subject-matter question when the Common Foreign and

Year = {2022},
Volume = {64},

Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Purpose In the Kazakhstani context, the instrumentalization of the
   Muftiate as a social engineering tool is particularly pertinent, as it
   stands out as a unique channel for the political, moral and cultural
   shaping of Muslims. This study aims to outline the role of the Muftiate,
   its historical background and recent restructuring process. It focuses
   on the ideological practices and religious discourses of the Muftiate.
   Design/methodology/approach In Kazakhstan, as a result of reforms in the
   religious sphere, which were started in 2011, the scope of activity of
   the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Kazakhstan (the Muftiate) has
   entered a new phase and become an important ideological tool within
   national policy. It has emerged as a civil society institution that will
   centralize the process of Islamization and instrumentalize the
   importance of Islam to create a new fantasy of unity and solidarity.
   Findings Thus, it discusses how Muftiate fabricates the correct forms of
   action and the correct form of thought. The theory of ``ideological
   state apparatuses{''} (ISA) of the French philosopher Louis Althusser
   should be considered as a theoretical framework of this study. This
   approach not only gives a theoretical definition of the Muftiate but
   also allows us to determine its position in society and outline three
   different dimensions of the practice that it performs. Originality/value
   The study demonstrates how the Muftiate as an ISA actualizes various
   concepts, ideas, beliefs or images in which Muslims live their imaginary
   relations to the real world and transforms Muslim individuals into
   ideological subjects, thus enabling them to become apparently free
   bearers of the ideology.},

Abstract = {Following the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Belarus and Kazakhstan appear caught
   in an alliance security dilemma characterised by intra-alliance threat
   and entrapment, as both are potential targets of militarised hybrid
   warfare by their vastly more powerful ally, Russia. Despite having
   sought foreign policy flexibility between the two increasingly opposed
   geopolitical camps of the West and Russia, Minsk and Nur-Sultan appear
   drawn further towards Moscow. Utilising their pre- and post-2014
   national security documents, reinforced by an examination of their
   rhetoric and policies, this essay demonstrates how both countries
   reassessed their security environment in the wake of the annexation of
   Crimea and the initial war in the Donbas region.},

Abstract = {The research studies different regulations and aspects of management of
   the Institute of Muslim clergy in Kazakhstan during the two eras: the
   period of the existence of the Russian Empire and the former USSR. The
   main tendencies and changes of the policies towards the Institute of
   Muslim clergy on the territory of Kazakhstan have been analysed and
   compared. Two main institutions of Muslim clergy became a focus of
   study: The Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly (OMDS in Russian) and the
   Spiritual Board of Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (SADUM in
   Russian). The study has three main goals: to investigate the main
   regulations of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union towards Muslim
   community and Muslim authorities in Kazakhstan; to observe how these
   regulations have changed over time and to find out the positive and
   negative implications of these regulations for Muslim community. The
   comprehensive literature search has been implemented together with the
   comparative historical review of the published literature and considered
   as appropriate methods to address the above-mentioned goals. The
   research found out that processes happening over that period of time
   were not homogeneous, but rather carried chaotic and fluctuating
   character. It was argued that the modern Spiritual Board of Muslims of
   Kazakhstan (DUMK in Russian) is a successor of OMDS and SADUM. Despite
   widespread opinions that the Russian rule and its constant persecution
   of Muslims had only negative impacts, it was claimed that it had a
   significance role in the development of institutionalization of the
   Muslim clergy in Kazakhstan. Moreover, it was revealed that there are
   some parallels and similarities between the approach of OMDS and the
   Russian Empire respectively in requirements for Muslim clergy and the
   approach of modern Kazakhstan government and DUMK.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The exponential population growth in urban areas makes existing solid
   waste management policies and strategies challenging. The situation
   becomes more strenuous in fast-growing cities where increasing waste
   production can hardly be met by the capacity of existing facilities.
   Practices like waste prevention, recycling, reuse, and recovery are
   fundamental elements needed for the reduction of solid waste disposed in
   landfills, especially in fast-growing cities where more sustainable
   management practices need to be adopted. This study investigated the
   behavioral attitudes of citizens of the capital of Kazakhstan,
   Nur-Sultan (former Astana), towards household solid waste disposal and
   separation at the source. The survey was conducted through stratified
   random sampling during April and July of 2018 with the participation of
   3281 respondents. It is the first attempt, to our knowledge, of
   assessing recycling trends in Kazakhstan from the household perspective.
   The results showed that 24\% of respondents were already sorting
   household solid waste despite the absence of a separation system at the
   source. The study further demonstrated that separation at source could
   be effective if the local authorities were to introduce sound public
   awareness campaigns and install recycling bins in close proximity to
   residential buildings.},

Abstract = {The paper examines Kazakhstan's decision to join the Bologna Process
   (BP), its implementation, and its impact on the higher education system
   in the country. Many post-Soviet countries have joined the BP, while
   many developing countries are also aligning their higher education
   systems with it. A diverse body of literature attempts to address the
   questions as to why do countries engage in policy borrowing and what
   makes it successful. Through our in-depth primary case study of
   Kazakhstan and a comparative assessment of similar cases in the
   post-Soviet space researched by other scholars, we make twofold
   contribution to this literature. First, we argue that governments often
   borrow policies with less clearer objectives, making it difficult to
   evaluate `success' or `failure' of the policy transfer. Second,
   differentiating between the success of policy transfer itself and the
   achievement of its perceived or real goals, we contend that the success
   of policy transfer is not a guarantee for the achievement of policies'
   original objectives which may be disappointing for both exporting and
   importing parties. In that, wide-ranging socio-political institutional
   differences explain the varied rationales and outcomes.},

Title = {Harvest failures, temporary export restrictions and global food
   security: the example of limited grain exports from Russia, Ukraine and
   Kazakhstan},
Journal = {FOOD SECURITY},

Abstract = {Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (RUK) are major players in the
   international grain markets and their exports help to improve global
   grain availability and hence food security. However, during the last
   decade the availability of RUK grain exports was repeatedly diminished
   by harvest failures and further reduced by the introduction of export
   restrictions. By simulating a reoccurrence of the 2010 RUK harvest
   situation this paper assesses the impact of grain harvest failures and
   subsequent temporary export restrictions (bans, quotas, taxes) on
   national and international food security, specifically quantifying the
   effects on agricultural market prices and quantities. For the analysis
   AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand
   model, has been employed. Simulation results highlight the importance of
   RUK's grain production for world markets and global food security,
   indicating substantial price increases due to limited grain exports from
   RUK. Moreover, scenario results illustrate that temporary RUK export
   restrictions can considerably aggravate the situation on world grain
   markets, with particularly adverse effects for grain net importing
   countries. At the same time, results show that for a country like
   Ukraine, i.e. a country usually exporting large shares of its total
   grain production, the introduction of export restrictions could
   potentially result in decreases of domestic consumer prices to a level
   even below a situation with normal weather conditions. The results put
   international trade policy into focus and underline the necessity of
   greater cooperation on the part of exporting countries in order to avoid
   importing countries being denied necessary grain supplies.},

Abstract = {Many countries have been experiencing a crisis in their pension systems
   for fiscal and demographic reasons. Voluntary pension funds are a way
   out of the crisis. The depth of the problem lies in the study of social
   and economic-mathematical aspects in making economic decisions on
   implementing voluntary contributions. The authors studied sustainable
   development, considering the assessment of the causal relationship
   between factors in the development of voluntary pension insurance in the
   Republic of Kazakhstan. The article analyzes pension system models and
   studies the experience of the OECD countries. The results of the
   analysis highlight the most important factors affecting the development
   of pension systems with an emphasis on voluntary pension insurance
   mechanisms. The authors propose a conservative, economic, extended
   economic, and extended intermediate solution for building a set of
   cause-and-effect models for the development of voluntary pension
   insurance in the Republic of Kazakhstan based on a survey of a
   representative sample of citizens in the Republic of Kazakhstan using

Title = {Assessment of Regional and Sectoral Parameters of Energy Supply in the
   Context of Effective Implementation of Kazakhstan's Energy Policy},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The development of global and regional energy markets is one of the most
   important problems of the current state of global economic relations and
   is one of the highest-priority areas in the formation of national and
   regional strategies for the socio-economic development of any country.
   The role of energy supply is focused on monitoring and compliance with
   standards. However, in recent years, the importance of energy supply to
   the housing stock has increased significantly, which has led to an
   expansion of the role of management within the framework of the risk
   management function. Kazakhstan has a Unified electric power system,
   which is represented by a set of power stations, transmission lines, and
   substations that provide reliable and high-quality energy supply to
   consumers. Currently, the main task within the framework of the priority
   of the development of Kazakhstan's energy sector is to build up the
   energy base and provide the growing needs of the population and the
   economy with the necessary energy resources based on the development of
   modern energy complexes and alternative energy sources in conjunction
   with the implemented and planned macroprojects. Since the current
   economic development of Kazakhstan is closely interrelated with the
   realization of energy resources and their effective use, it acts as one
   of the fundamental levers for the development of the national economy.
   According to our research goal, it is necessary to consider sustainable
   energy supply in the country based on the analysis and assessment of
   energy consumption volumes and the impact of the country's regional and
   sectoral policies on their use. The author's approach to the
   distribution of countries by MNC has been developed and estimates of
   regression parameters, correlation coefficients, and elasticity
   coefficients. When constructing the author's approach, the countries of
   Europe and Central Asia were studied and a sample of estimates was
   carried out, which has statistically significant effects on the
   formation of energy consumption volumes in the Republic of Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {The present paper provides a detailed analysis of the current situation
   on municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Kazakhstan with focus on
   the two major cities, Astana and Almaty, the current and former capital
   of the country. Untill recently, ninety-seven percent of the MSW was
   disposed in open dumps and substandard authorized landfills.
   Ninety-three percent of the 4530 municipal waste disposal landfills were
   not permitted, while from the 307 authorized waste disposal facilities,
   only the one in the city of Astana was designed in accordance with
   international standards (2015). Core legislation, current management
   policy, existing and planned facilities and infrastructure, as well as
   solid waste quantity and composition are discussed. The analysis is
   complemented by the implementation of a decision support software tool,
   which provides insights in waste management needs and evaluates the
   alternative waste management plans. Six alternative scenarios were
   evaluated, and the results obtained demonstrate that the optimum
   scenario is separation at source for both biowaste, which is composted
   and packaging waste processed via the materials recovery facility.
   Regarding the residual waste, the optimum scenario for Astana is
   mechanical biological treatment (MBT)-composting-recyclables and
   waste-to-energy for the refuse-derived fuel (RDF). For Almaty, 80\% of
   the waste should be processed through MBT-composting-recyclables, and
   20\% via incineration and RDF. The results obtained can contribute to
   solid waste management planning in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian
   countries.},

Abstract = {One of the priority directions of administrative reforms that take place
   in the Republic of Kazakhstan is the enhancement of civil service
   effectiveness. And, the success of reforms will mostly be determined by
   the condition of civil service, which depends on the performance of
   civil servants. Taking into consideration the importance of motivated
   and satisfied employees on their commitment, this study was aimed to
   identify the relationship between motivation and job satisfaction on
   employees' commitment and studying the mediating role of job
   satisfaction on the relationship of civil servants' motivation and
   organizational commitment in the central and local executive bodies in
   Kazakhstan. In total, 1205 civil servants from 5 ministries and 4
   regional administration completed a questionnaire adapted from previous
   studies. The results show significant relationships exist between work
   motivation dimensions and organizational commitment as well as work
   motivation and job satisfaction. Moreover, the study found the mediating
   effect of job satisfaction on the hypothesized relationships. This paper
   contributes to the existing human resources literature on employees'
   commitment and guides management on how to improved employees' job
   satisfaction and employee's commitment.},

Abstract = {The penal legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan includes a number of
   crimes against the peace and security of mankind. Among these are most
   of the traditional ``core{''} crimes under international law-genocide,
   war crimes, and the crime of aggression-as well as some other crimes.
   Crimes against humanity are not included in the Criminal Code so far but
   some of their definitional features are shared by so-called ``extremist
   crimes{''}. In addition to other customary crimes against the peace and
   security of mankind-such as deliberately attacking internationally
   protected persons and organizations and abusing internationally
   protected emblems-the Code also includes more novel crimes, such as
   participation in foreign armed conflicts. This paper analyses the
   relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan in the light of
   corresponding treaty-based and customary rules of international law, and
   suggests further improvements to be made to the Code.},

Abstract = {With the growth of English medium instruction (EMI) on a global level,
   the number of multilingual students writing their master's theses in
   English is increasing. However, research on students' experiences of
   writing them in English in non-English speaking contexts is scarce. This
   paper reports on the challenges and strategic learning efforts of eight
   Kazakhstani students while working on their master's thesis projects in
   a Kazakhstani EMI university. The qualitative data collected from a
   written narrative and three subsequent semi-structured interviews
   revealed that almost all the participants had a clear preference for a
   directive supervision style, whereby supervisors give stage-by-stage
   guidance. The result was a clash of expectations, miscommunication and
   confusion between supervisors and supervisees in some cases, especially
   since most supervisors come from English-speaking countries. Two
   participants, however, favoured a laissez-faire supervisory style where
   the supervisor orchestrated their supervisees' learning efforts
   implicitly by giving them room to work independently. All participants
   also articulated certain effective strategies to confront the diverse
   challenges associated with constructing a new identity for themselves as
   researchers, time management, and `imposter syndrome'. From this
   qualitative study, practical recommendations for developing the
   effectiveness (quality) of master's thesis supervision in EMI
   universities are made.},

Abstract = {Purpose is prediction of the prospective areas within the Syrymbet
   deposit basing on the systematization and complement-ing of the
   ore-controlling factors of ore localization and predictive-prospecting
   criteria.Methods. The methodology of carrying out the research in terms
   of the indicated problem involves complex application of empiric,
   theoretical, and logical techniques of a general-purpose method of
   scientific knowledge. To model the ore bodies and distribution of ore
   content in them in the 3D format, the computer modelling (GIS-Micromine)
   methods were used; 2D model-ling of a temperature field of the
   ore-bearing Syrymbet mass involved methods of mathematical modelling
   (Maple 10). The main conclusions were drawn by means of analysis and
   synthesis of the results obtained by the indicated methods.Findings. The
   ore-controlling factors of the localization of rare metal ores were
   systematized and complemented by syn-thesizing the results of the
   analysis of 3D models of the deposit under consideration with the
   visualization of ore component contents within the ore bodies and their
   2D sections in terms of the survey profiles where spatial distribution
   of tin content in the vertical section of this deposit was obtained. The
   factors were also updated by analyzing the thermodynamic conditions of
   the formation of ore stockworks where temperature conditions of the
   enclosing media in the area of ore formation were consid-ered along with
   the intervals of the ore deposition temperatures.Originality. The
   results of scientific studies (computer and mathematical modelling)
   based on the empiric geological data helped solve not only the problems
   of ore formation theory but also the practical tasks concerning the
   improvement of methods for predicting the prospective areas within the
   deposit.Practical implications. The methodology of scientific study
   dealing with systematization of ore-controlling factors can be also used
   for other endogenous ore objects.},

Title = {The circular economy approach to evaluating end-of-life cost
   alternatives of solar PV panels: The case of Burnoye-1, Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The circular economy concept resonates as a new approach to optimize
   limited resource usage and reduce waste generation. However, the most
   solar PV power plant analyses do not consider the sustainable disposal
   of used systems at the end of life (EoL) or at the time for potential
   refurbishment. The 50 MWp Burnoye-1 solar power plant in the Jambyl
   region in Kazakhstan was modeled using the RETScreen Expert platform to
   determine how the circular economy concept may increase its
   environmental benefits and impact the levelized cost of produced
   electricity. Results proved that recycling Burnoye-1's photovoltaic
   panels at EoL would increase the project's Net Present profit by almost
   0.373 million USD, marginally raising its Benefit-cost and internal rate
   of return (IRR) on equity by much less than 1\% each, with respect to
   the non-recycling baseline. However, a significant impact on the 25-year
   lifetime GHG emissions is achieved when PV recycling is considered.
   Recycling the PV panels in Burnoye-1 at the EoL would add an extra 76.5
   ktCO(2e) emissions reduction, representing an increase of 8.7\% in its
   avoided lifetime GHG emissions. Furthermore, PV recycling may generate
   local jobs benefitting the neighboring communities. Thus, this study
   demonstrates that the circular economy approach is viable in Kazakhstan
   and will help the country meet its goal of becoming carbon neutral by
   2060.},

Title = {Research on the Coordination between Agricultural Production and

   Objective Weighting Method},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In the context of sustainable development, agricultural production and
   environmental protection are inseparable, and environmental quality
   directly affects regional agricultural production safety. Kazakhstan is
   the largest food producer and exporter in Central Asia, and the quality
   of its agricultural environment is of great significance to
   international food security. This study focuses on the rationality of
   the entropy weight, factor weight, and CRITIC weight in the agricultural
   environmental evaluation within the common objective weight method, and
   comprehensively evaluates the coordination of environmental protection
   and agricultural production in Kazakhstan. The results show that (1)
   CRITIC weights are the most stable, followed by factor weights, while
   entropy weighting is the most unstable; objective weighting methods have
   their limitations and must be related to actual conditions and
   subjective experience. (2) The level of environmental protection and the
   degree of coordination are most problematic near the Aral Sea, followed
   by the remaining western region; the results reveal that these
   evaluation indexs are also insufficient at Kostany and Karagandy in the
   central region; this is caused by historical issues, climate change,
   natural conditions, and agricultural management patterns. Investment in
   environmental protection and agricultural production management should
   be coordinated in a targeted manner. (3) Except for the areas near the
   Aral Sea, the level of agricultural production in other states is very
   promising. This research serves as a reference for environmental
   assessment research, environmental governance investment, and
   agricultural production management in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Place-based social, cultural, institutional and political dynamics not
   only influence the innovation capacity of agricultural systems, but also
   the willingness of relevant actors to be involved in participatory
   research processes, and the dynamics of their participation. This paper
   critically discusses the modification and application of one particular
   participatory approach to agricultural systems analysis (Rapid Appraisal
   of Agricultural Innovation Systems {[}RAAIS]) to agricultural adaptation
   in Southeast Kazakhstan. We consider the overall effectiveness of the
   method as a research tool, practical issues in the implementation of
   workshops, definition of and selection of participant groups, as well as
   the questions of participation and empowerment within the workshops
   themselves. We find that although RAAIS is adaptable to alternative
   theoretical frameworks, its implementation in different socio-cultural
   and political contexts may require more consideration than is apparent
   in previous discussions. In particular, the appropriate training of
   workshop organisers is of crucial importance to the success of this
   methodology. These findings will be useful to those adapting
   participatory research methods to different research topics and contexts
   more broadly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The article examines the impact of changes in the gold part of the
   reserves of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on their total volume with
   an emphasis on the factor of changes in the price of gold. The value of
   the factor of the price of gold increases during periods of global
   financial crises when Kazakhstan, as an oil exporting country, is under
   strong pressure on the current account and the exchange rate of the
   tenge due to a decline in oil prices. During these periods, the National
   Bank conducts foreign exchange interventions to support the tenge
   exchange rate and spends its reserves, which increases the relevance of
   their safety. The paper tests the hypothesis that in such periods, the
   rise in the price of gold, due to its function as a safe haven asset,
   can compensate expenditures on foreign exchange interventions for the
   central banks and increase the stability of reserves. From this point of
   view, the article examines three periods of high turbulence in world
   markets of the 2000s and changes in the National Bank's gross reserves,
   as well as the influence of the gold factor on these changes. It was
   revealed that during the crisis periods, the rise in the price of gold
   contributed to the stability of the gross reserves of the National Bank,
   and the effectiveness of this factor was directly proportional to the
   gold share in the reserves.},

Abstract = {The significance of the innovative development of the modern society of
   the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) has actualized the need for creative
   individuals, who determine progress in various spheres of social life.
   In this regard, the fundamental goal of the modern higher pedagogical
   school was the development of creative personalities capable of
   self-actualizing their skills for the benefit of the society. The
   purpose of the article is the development of conceptual recommendations
   on the formation and development of creative competence of future
   teachers as a potential human factor in shaping the value system of the
   future generation. The criteria for assessing the levels of the
   formation of creative competence in future teachers in the context of
   its structural components have been developed. Interviewing helped to
   analyze the qualitative levels of the formation of creative competence
   of students of pedagogical universities in Kazakhstan. The article
   substantiates the main destructive factors of development of students'
   creativity in the system of higher pedagogical education in modern
   conditions. The authors developed the structural and logical model for
   the development of the creativity of future teachers based on the
   principle of problem education. The authors also developed a diagnostic
   approach to assessing the effectiveness of the practical implementation
   of the pedagogical conditions of the creativity model in the educational
   process of future teachers in higher educational institutions of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan. The article proves the complex of the actions
   promoting the evolution of creative competence of students of a
   pedagogical specialty.},

Title = {The Dynamics of Labor Militancy in the Extractive Sector: Kazakhstan's
   Oilfields and South Africa's Platinum Mines in Comparative Perspective},

Abstract = {This article investigates why, in two very different regimes, similarly
   high levels of labor militancy are evident in Kazakhstan's oilfields and
   South Africa's platinum belt. It also explores the common dynamics
   leading up to the massacres at Zhanaozen (2011) and Marikana (2012). The
   hypothesis-generating most different systems comparison highlights the
   challenges of labor relations where extraction at fixed sites combines
   with volatile prices and shareholder pressures in a globalized economy
   to raise the stakes for business, labor, and state. Also significant are
   blockages in existing channels for bargaining linked to quiescent
   unions. These jointly necessary conditions account for increased
   militancy in extractive industries in Kazakhstan and South Africa. To
   account for the Zhanaozen and Marikana massacres, timing and sequence
   are considered. Both standoffs came later in the strike wave, prompting
   impatient state and business elites to criticize the protests as
   ``criminal{''} acts, and priming security personnel to employ violent
   repression.},

Journal = {FOLKLORE-ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF FOLKLORE},

Abstract = {This article is the first publication of materials about Pakhta-Aral
   prison camp No. 29 for prisoners of war. The fate of prisoners of war
   (both Western and Eastern) remains largely unclear. One reason is
   because the camps for prisoners of war were subordinated to an extremely
   closed and classified structure - the GUPVI. To some extent, Pakhta-Aral
   was an untypical prison camp in the Soviet prison camp system. While
   most prison camps were established to support industry or resource
   extraction with labour, then a far smaller number of prison camps were
   connected to agriculture. The Pakhta-Aral camp was opened as a workforce
   supply for the cotton growing collective farms of Kazakhstan.
   Interestingly, archival data show that the need to supply the camp with
   food and clothes added some liberal aspects to camp life. Some
   researchers argue that prison camps were a model for the so-called
   `non-Gulag' society, but the Pakhta-Aral camp shows that at least some
   civic practices were adopted where they helped to improve the
   functioning of the camp.},

Abstract = {The transition process did not affect the organisation of agricultural
   production as originally anticipated. Since the late 1990s, in Russia
   and some other CIS countries, numerous large-scale agro-holdings emerged
   which agglomerated multiple farms, entities of the upstream and
   downstream sectors of agribusiness, as well as non-agricultural
   industries. Owing to the common practice of registering such affiliated
   farms/firms as independent business units, data on agro-holdings'
   aggregate group performance are extremely scarce. It is therefore
   difficult to capture their emergence, determinants of growth and
   developmental prospects.This study is based on a unique panel dataset
   from Moscow and Belgorod regions. The growth trajectories of farms
   affiliated to agro-holdings vis-a-vis independent farms were
   investigated by applying a quantile regression approach. Overall, only
   minor differences were found. Any advantages of affiliated farms appear
   to be due to extramural factors; i.e. it is all about how to link
   individual production units, thus benefiting from strong positioning in
   local and regional markets and making the most of lobbying and ties to
   relevant politicians. In sum, agro-holdings are expected to remain as a
   model for organising agricultural production.},

   Russia and Kazakhstan},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {The experience of experiencing a new culture for first-generation
   migrants is usually quite an intense occurrence, one that has become the
   subject of numerous studies. However, the question of what happens
   later, at the level of the second and subsequent generations, is still
   under-investigated. The purpose of this study was to analyze the
   predictors of positive and negative affect of the second generation of
   migrants and representatives of the host (indigenous) population in
   Kazakhstan and Russia. The study involved 300 people selected on the
   basis of the principle of proportionality (quota selection). Survey
   methods and mathematical methods of data processing, including SEM
   (structural equation modeling), were used. The research model included
   comparative analysis of averages, regression analysis, and path
   analysis. The results testified in favor of the similarity of positive
   and negative affect indicators and their ratios in representatives of
   the host community and the second generation of migrants. Cultural
   attitudes of the host community representatives were characterized by
   higher certainty and rigidity than those of the representatives of the
   second generation of migrants. As a result of structural modeling, it
   was found that 20\% of the positive affect dispersion in the
   representatives of the host community and 17\% in the representatives of
   the second generation of migrants were conditioned by values, identity,
   and cultural attitudes. Positive affect in the representatives of the
   host community was associated with the values of self-overcoming,
   ethno-nihilism-based identity, and participation in cultural life of
   other peoples. Positive affect in representatives of the second
   generation of migrants was associated with the values of openness,
   attitude towards changing one's ethnic identity, positive attitude
   towards cultural borrowings, and a tendency to observe the traditions of
   one's ethnic group. Proposals have been formulated that contribute to
   reducing the cultural disunity of second-generation migrants and the
   host population.},

Abstract = {Given the trend of increasing imbalance in the economic development of
   administrative-territorial units and ensuring their innovative
   development, the issue of upgrading the effectiveness of the anti-crisis
   regional policy is becoming urgent. The research aim is to develop an
   econometric model for assessing the impact of asymmetries in the
   development of urban economies on the regional socio-economic
   development based on the case of Kazakhstan. The article establishes a
   sample of indicators of socio-economic development of cities and regions
   in Kazakhstan in 2014-2018. The governance indicators of the influence
   of the asymmetry in urban development on the regional socio-economic
   development in Kazakhstan have been determined based on the Granger
   causality test, the creation of a cognitive map and the identification
   of hierarchy levels. The asymmetry in regional development has been
   estimated applying the coefficient of variation of the relevant
   indicators of socio-economic development of cities and regions, taking
   into account the lagged variables. The developed model allows
   determining the convergence model of regional development, the nature of
   the influence of asymmetries in the development of cities on the
   regional economic development in the context of economic growth and
   recession, as well as identifying the key factors in the asymmetry of
   regional development. The results are based on reliable data; they are
   of practical importance and can serve as the basis for the elaboration
   of effective preventive measures for anti-crisis regional development
   policy, not only to neutralize asymmetries, but also to achieve economic
   growth under the conditions of unbalanced regional development.},

Abstract = {In modern global conditions, the revival of the economic belt of the
   Great Silk Road as a whole opens up new significant opportunities for
   countries along the route to develop the economies of these countries.
   Nowadays, the main factors for the integration of these countries are
   logistics, international trade, and tourism. The relevance of the study
   lies in the very methodological approach of assessing the logistics
   factors affecting the economy of a number of countries along the
   economic belt of the Silk Road.
   A group of preliminary countries, through which lie main routes of the
   economic belt of Silk Road, including Kazakhstan, were selected. An
   analysis was carried out on the efficiency of development of logistics
   and trade, impact of development of logistics on international trade.
   Based on the analysis of international indices of logistics efficiency,
   international trade conditions and regression models, problems and
   reasons for lagging have been identified that affect the economic
   development of countries along the Silk Road routes.
   Priority initiatives have been identified to overcome restrictions that
   impede the development of logistics and increase trade capacity in the
   countries of the Silk Road, in particular the Eurasian Economic Union

Abstract = {This paper analyses the extent to which Kazakhstan's agency in its
   interaction with China's `Belt and Road' initiative is shaped not only
   by Russia and China's outward projection, but also de-centring practices
   at the regional and sub-national level. The Kazakhstani government has
   embraced China's Silk Road economic belt (SREB-the land-based `belt' of
   the BRI) and has aligned its `Nurly Zhol' domestic stimulus programme
   with the SREB. At the same time, Kazakhstan's membership in the Eurasian
   Economic Union increases Russian leverage over Kazakhstani trade and
   tariff policies. The advent of the BRI thus exacerbates, but has not
   caused, a partially competing logic behind Russia's defensive
   regionalism and Kazakhstan's professed multi-vector foreign policy.
   Contrasting the latter with Russian and Chinese geopolitical constraints
   imposed on the sociopolitical fabric of Kazakhstan, the paper examines
   how Kazakhstan is a microcosm for the dynamics of a new Eurasian order
   in the making.},

Abstract = {The dual legitimacy of an international non-governmental organisation
   (INGO) affiliate is critical to the INGO's sustainable development, but
   few studies are found in the extant literature. Based on Kostova and
   Zaheer's theoretical concept elaborating on organisational legitimacy
   under conditions of complexity, we conducted this study through the
   extended case method and used the grounded theory approach to examine
   the case study of the child organisation (CO) in Taiwan and its
   affiliate in Kyrgyzstan (CKO). Utilising an integrated framework
   elaborating on the INGO affiliate's dual legitimacy (IADL), we examined
   the impact generated from the institutional environments in a
   multidimensional construct at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels. This
   study also explored the complexity of and interactions with the
   institutional environment that INGO affiliates might encounter. The
   findings of this study could serve as a guideline for INGO workers,

Abstract = {Over one hundred children and some of their parents were infected with
   HIV in state hospitals in the Chimkent region in Southern Kazakhstan.
   After this tragedy, the Regional Department of Public Health organized
   social services for these families and asked the American Jewish Joint
   Distribution Committee (JDC) to provide them with training and
   supervision. Twelve seminars were conducted for the social workers in
   Chimkent over an 18-month period. The JDC team also met with the local
   medical staff as well as with governmental and nongovernmental
   organizations to assess their needs and provide organizational support
   for the social services. This article presents an analysis of the
   psychosocial challenges associated with the mass HIV infection episode
   in Kazakhstan. The analysis is based on Hofstede's (2001) theory of
   cultural values, theories on cross-cultural interaction (Cushner \&
   Brislin, 1995), and principles of multicultural social work
   (Potocky-Tripodi, 2002). The training program is described, and its
   results are discussed. General principles and practical recommendations
   for planning and implementing cross-cultural international humanitarian
   programs in the field of HIV are suggested. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {In the context of the transition of the national economy of the Republic
   of Kazakhstan to an innovative type of development, the issues of the
   formation and development of human capital are becoming increasingly
   important. Increasing labor productivity, developing high-tech
   production, creating innovative products in the republic is impossible
   without providing the branches of the national economy with personnel
   who have the necessary professional and personal competencies. In turn,
   social and economic factors affect the formation and quality of human
   capital, while there is an uneven spatial distribution of human
   resources. Accordingly, the priorities of the socio-economic development
   of the territories require coordination with the tasks of increasing
   human capital. The basis of this study is the analysis of the
   reproduction processes of human capital in the regions of the Republic
   of Kazakhstan, taking into account the socio-economic component. The
   object of the research is the human capital of the regions of the
   Republic of Kazakhstan, the subject of the research is the
   socio-economic aspect of the development of human capital. The method of
   the integral index for assessing human capital was taken as the main
   model for calculating human capital. We identified not only
   socio-economic factors affecting the effective use of human capital in
   the regions, but also demographic, environmental components and
   calculated indices based on these factors. The analysis showed that one
   of the key factors affecting the differentiation of the level of
   accumulated human capital is socio-economic. According to the results,
   the regions were identified as leaders and outsiders in terms of the
   level of accumulated human capital, regions with a post-industrial
   warehouse of the economy have high indicators of the human capital
   index, regions with agricultural specialization are low.},

Abstract = {Background Trauma can lead to trauma centrality and affect levels of
   interpersonal sensitivity and psychiatric co-morbidity. Whether a
   coexisting relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
   trauma centrality can influence levels of interpersonal sensitivity and
   psychiatric co-morbidity among university students from Kazakhstan is
   unknown. Aim To investigate the impact of the aforementioned co-existing
   relationship on interpersonal sensitivity and psychiatric co-morbidity
   among Kazakh university students. Methods 597 students (F = 428, M =
   169) completed questionnaires measuring PTSD, psychiatric co-morbidity,
   interpersonal sensitivity, and trauma centrality. Results 28\%, 32\% and
   40\% met the criteria for full, partial and no-PTSD, respectively.
   Latent Class Analysis revealed a three-class solution: Class 1 (the
   altered-self group) with a low level of PTSD but a high level of trauma
   centrality, Class 2 (the traumatized-self group) with high levels of
   PTSD and trauma centrality and Class 3 (the low symptom group) with low
   levels of PTSD and trauma centrality. There were significant differences
   in the levels of interpersonal sensitivity and psychiatric co-morbidity
   across three classes. Conclusion There are individual differences in the
   display of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and trauma
   centrality. These differences can influence interaction with others and
   psychological distress.},

Title = {Rise and decline of the fishery industry in the Aydarkul-Arnasay Lake
   System (Uzbekistan): effects of reservoir management, irrigation farming
   and climate change on an unstable ecosystem},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Originally, a shallow saline depression between the Kyzylkum and the
   Nurata mountain range the Aydarkul-Arnasay Lake System (AALS) was
   created in 1969 when a catastrophic flood event in the Syr Darya
   catchment exceeded the capacity of the Chardarya reservoir. Additional
   water diversions further increased the volume of the lakes to up to 42.2
   mln m(3) in 2006. After the breakdown of the commercial fishing in the
   Uzbek part of the Aral Sea in 1983, the AALS became the most important
   fishery lake in Uzbekistan with an annual catch of more than 4600 tons
   (in 1988). In recent years, however, the fish catch experienced a sharp
   decline (down to 728 tons in 2006) due to the increased inflow of
   drainage water from the large Golodnaya Steppe (Hunger Steppe)
   irrigation scheme (e.g., 0.1 km(3) in 1960, 1.0 km(3) in 1970, 2.3 km(3)
   in 1980, 2.9 km(3) in 2000 and 3.6 km(3) in 2010) and a decrease in
   freshwater inflow from the Chardarya reservoir (e.g., 4.0 km(3) in 1995,
   2.3 km(3) in 2005 and 1.8 km(3) in 2010). The increasing anthropogenic
   pressure, as well as the impacts of the climate change (+0.6-0.9 degrees
   C between 1950 and 2000, decrease in the long-term precipitation and
   increase in the variability), is threatening this ecological and
   economic important lake system. This article presents new data about the
   temporal dynamic of the lake hydrology (size, volume, water balance),
   the surrounding climate and its development as well as about the water
   quality of the lakes and the main drainage water collectors, and the
   development of the fish fauna over the last decades. This study, based
   on official data (Uzhydromet, Uzryba), online databases (GHCN) and
   extensive field work (water quality and fish sampling), provides a
   complete published analysis of the status quo of the AALS. Therefore, it
   is an important contribution to the establishment of a stable lake
   ecosystem system and a sustainable fishing industry.},

Abstract = {Background: In Kazakhstan, as in many other countries, a transformation
   of the traditional stereotypes of reproductive behavior, and change the
   types of family relationships is occurred. It is caused by social status
   changes, by the transformation of women's valuable orientations and
   social-role attitudes. The objective of this study was to identify the
   indicators of reproductive units and the motives for having children in
   the family
   Methods: Designed questionnaires were used to study the regulation of
   fertility in young families, and women's views about the ideal, desired,
   and expected number of children per family. The survey covered 1017
   respondents aged less than 39 years.
   Results: Expected number of children in the family depends on living
   conditions. The average expected number of children per family increases
   with improvement of living conditions and with increases in income.
   Statistically significant differences in the average expected number of
   children in families with a satisfactory and good income compared to
   poor income (P<0.001). Revealed the predominance of the expected,
   desired and ideal number of children among women of Asian ethnic group
   and on the desired and ideal number of children the differences were
   statistically significant (P<0.05). By mathematical formula that based
   on a poll can be calculated probability of birth of each child in the
   family.
   Conclusion: Reproductive attitudes of Astana women depend on age,
   educational level, income, professional employment, marital status, and
   ethnicity. The findings confirm the hypothesis that family plans are
   largely exposed to specific conditions of life.},

Title = {The Asymmetric Effect of Oil Price Fluctuation on Non-performing Loans
   in Kazakhstan: Evidence from the Ricardian Curse of the Resource Boom},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the asymmetric impact of oil price fluctuations
   on non-performing loans (NPLs) between 2009-Q1 and 2020-Q1 for 28 banks
   in Kazakhstan. Dynamic panel threshold analysis revealed an initial
   increase of oil prices, improving creditworthiness, thereby reducing
   NPLs; however, after cross a certain threshold, the relationship was
   shown to become the opposite. This finding is in line with the Ricardian
   curse and resource windfall. The results suggest that optimal borrowings
   and lending should be actively monitored to mitigate potential liquidity
   problems of banks and consequently NPLs. The practical implications and
   policy recommendation of which are important to policy makers.},

Title = {When the ``We{''} Impacts How ``I{''} Feel About Myself Effect of
   Temporal Collective Relative Deprivation on Personal Well-being in the
   Context of Dramatic Social Change in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {271-282},
Abstract = {Dramatic social change leads to profound societal transformations in
   many countries around the world. The two recent revolutions in March
   2005 and April 2010, and the ethnic conflict in June 2010 in Kyrgyzstan
   are vivid examples. The present research aims to understand people's
   reactions to dramatic social change in terms of personal well-being. To
   further understand how people react psychologically to dramatic social
   change, the theoretical framework of our research is based on a dominant
   theory in social psychology: Collective relative deprivation theory. In
   the past, researchers have argued that collective relative deprivation
   is logically associated with collective outcomes, and thus is not likely
   to impact personal well-being (e. g., Walker \& Mann, 1987). Others,
   however, have argued that feelings of collective relative deprivation do
   impact personal well-being (e. g., Zagefka \& Brown, 2005). We postulate
   that these inconsistent results arise because past research has failed
   to consider multiple points of comparison over time to assess collective
   relative deprivation. Specifically, we theorize that multiple points of
   collective relative deprivation need to be taken into account, and in so
   doing, collective relative deprivation will, indeed, be related to
   personal well-being. We also explore the entire trajectory of collective
   relative deprivation (which represents how an individual perceives the
   evolution of his/her group's history across time) to predict personal
   well-being. In the present study, we tested these theoretical
   propositions in the context of dramatic social change in Kyrgyzstan.
   Regressions, group-based trajectory modeling, and MANOVA confirm our
   hypotheses.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper investigates socialization to genre knowledge in a university
   in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic where the Russian language
   remains prevalent while Kazakh is still being revitalized and elaborated
   for academic purposes. The authors conducted a survey of postgraduate
   students (n = 53) and alumni (n = 57) along with focus groups (n = 26)
   in a single discipline in order to identify the self-reported extent of
   genre knowledge devel-opment, and processes of development and
   application, in English, Kazakh, and Russian. Quantitative data show
   students have slightly higher genre knowledge in Russian than English or
   Kazakh, but alumni often see English genre knowledge as more important
   than Russian or Kazakh in their workplaces. Qualitative data show that
   socialization to English genre knowledge was so successful, at times
   respondents underwent a process of reverse socialization of practices
   from English to Russian or Kazakh. In other instances, respondents
   directly applied skills learned in English to both Kazakh and Russian in
   ways that suggested they were socializing Russian- and Kazakh-speaking
   peers to new practices. The results suggest an ecological approach to
   teaching and learning English for Academic Purposes is recommended to
   ensure students in multilingual contexts are able to develop and
   negotiate communication skills among multiple languages. (c) 2020

Abstract = {Researchers interviewed 27 youth sport coaches and physical education
   teachers from Jordan and Tajikistan who previously participated in a
   sport for development and peace (SDP) train-the-trainer program. The
   purpose was to gain an understanding of the lived experiences of
   participants and how they used sports activities in their positions of
   leadership to foster conditions that conceptually correspond to a
   culture of positive peace. Using an inductive-coding analysis,
   researchers identified two main dimensions discussed in this paper: (a)
   Changes in Everyday Lived Realities and (b) Practical Strategies for
   Fostering Nonviolence. Participants mentioned changes in their attitudes
   and behaviors as well as in youth athletes' attitudes and behaviors on
   and off the field. New strategies involved peace education, conflict
   resolution skills, and lessons learned on the field. Findings from this
   study provide a better understanding of some of the lived experiences of
   sport coaches and physical education teachers as stakeholders promoting
   a positive peace years after being trained in SDP work. Implications of
   the present findings call for supporting SDP stakeholders' vital
   involvement in social initiatives that work to address both observable
   and unobservable factors which threaten to divide youth.},

Abstract = {The article reflects the results of a study on the formation of
   communicative competence among future teachers in different countries:
   Russia, Greece, and Kazakhstan on the material of Russian, English, and
   Kazakh languages. The professional training of a future foreign language
   teacher for migrants of different generations and persons focused on
   migration and professional growth outside national borders is aimed at
   mastering the whole range of professional competencies of the
   ethno-pedagogical, historical-cultural, and psycholinguistic plan. The
   authors consider the case method as a real effective didactic technique
   that forms ethno-linguistic and cultural communicative competence, which
   is inextricably linked with ethnic norms of pronunciation of sounds,
   understanding of texts in foreign languages and background knowledge.
   The technology consists in the use of methods of complex analysis,
   discussion, or decision-making on a certain section of disciplines using
   previously acquired knowledge. The authors believe that the case method
   in the era of the pandemic is becoming a key methodological technique
   that forms a complex ethno-pedagogical competence. The case technology
   combines the simultaneous reflection of a practical problem with the
   actualization of the complex of acquired knowledge in a combination of
   educational and analytical activities. The practical significance
   reflects the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, since the case method
   develops independent thinking in future teachers of foreign languages,
   forms the ability to deeply understand the topic, helps to combine
   theoretical knowledge with the realities of life.},

   bail. These limit the constitutional rights and freedoms of the suspect
   and are authorised by the investigating judge.The authors analyse the
   legislative regulation, legal statistics, and judicial authorisation of
   these preventive measures. They also demonstrate the ambiguous use of
   bail in the period before its transfer to judicial control. In order to
   increase its effectiveness and reduce the number of prisoners, it is
   proposed to separate property surety from bail and make it an
   independent measure of restraint, similar to the US experience regarding
   commercial surety, and change the current procedure for replacing
   detention with bail. The article deals with the issue of strengthening
   the control functions of the investigating judge when authorising home
   confinement as a preventive measure. In particular, the authors analyse
   the draft Law `On amendments and Additions to Some Legislative Acts of
   the Republic of Kazakhstan on optimisation of criminal legislation with
   simultaneous correction of the Criminal Procedure and Penal Enforcement
   Codes' and offer their vision of further development of the norms of
   criminal procedure legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan on judicial
   control. The authors propose to narrow the limits established by law for
   the application of various legal restrictions infringing on the rights
   and legitimate interests of suspects and preserve them only to the
   extent necessary to solve the public tasks of criminal proceedings.},

Title = {Spatiality and Symbolic Characteristics: Dynamics of Collective
   Religious Rituals among Sunni Muslims and Russian Orthodox Christians in
   Kazakhstan during the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The article's purpose is to discuss on a cross-disciplinary plane
   whether the space's changing dimension (in terms of social distancing),
   caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect religious symbols'
   characteristics and rituals, leading to new symbolical representation.
   This is analyzed by addressing the influence of the pandemic on
   conducting religious practices (Friday Prayer, Namaz, Ramadan,
   Qurban-ait (Eid al Adha), Sunday Sermon, Easter) among the Sunni Muslims
   and Russian Orthodox Church believers in Kazakhstan. Theoretically, it
   seeks to correlate inner dynamics of the typology, or `production of
   space' vis-a-vis symbolic characteristics and elements of ritual. The
   proposed hypothesis is that (1) if there is a direct correlation between
   spatiality and symbols (that are `deployed' in rituals), (2) then change
   of spatiality can affect the performance of symbol's each
   characteristic, and the rituals. The following research methods have
   been used: online group interview in the religious focus groups differed
   in religious makeup (Sunni Islamic and Russian Orthodox Church) and
   thematic analysis. The empirical findings support the hypothesis and
   show that social distancing triggered the fluctuation and changes
   pertaining to the figurative quality and perceptibility of the symbol,
   following the modification of religious rituals and the appearance of a
   wide range of perceptions, respectively. Though the full-fledged
   symbolization of the changes of religious rituals due to the pandemic is
   not the case in today's Kazakhstan, some elements of new evolving
   attitude are evident.},

Abstract = {Since gaining independence in 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan has been
   consistently working on restoring the national identity. An important
   role in this process is played by education, therefore, there is a
   growing Government interest in instilling national values in pre-service
   and in-service teachers. The aim of the research was to establish
   whether the attitudes towards the traditional values of the Kazakh
   people held by Master's students majoring in Education would change as a
   result of studying an elective course in Ethnopedagogy. Based on an
   analysis of the traditional values of the Kazakh people undertaken by
   Kazakh researchers, a classification of these values was developed and
   used as a basis for a questionnaire designed to identify attitudes
   towards these values. A survey was conducted with the students from two
   universities. The sample of the research was 119 people: 59 students
   formed the experimental group (the one where the elective course was
   taught), the remaining 60 were in the control group (that did not study
   the course). The survey was conducted twice: before the beginning and
   after the end of the course. The results of the first survey showed no
   statistically significant differences between the experimental and
   control groups. The second survey clearly showed positive changes in the
   attitudes towards the traditional values of the Kazakh people in the
   experimental group, while in the control group the results remained
   approximately at the level of the first survey. A conclusion was made
   that it is necessary to strengthen the national and cultural components
   in the content of pedagogical education in the Republic of Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Evaluation of effects of cotton policy changes on land and water use in
   Uzbekistan: Application of a bio-economic farm model at the level of a
   water users association},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Various agricultural policies have been implemented in post-Soviet
   countries as they move from centrally planned to market economies. In
   the agriculture sector of Uzbekistan, Central Asia, several reforms have
   been implemented to increase the operational autonomy of agricultural
   producers. However, land and water use in agriculture remains directly
   linked to the centrally regulated cotton production. Still partly
   resembling the design of the state orders imposed during the planned
   economy, cotton production policy is used to ensure the stability of
   national export revenues at the expense of farm incomes. In this paper
   we argue that modifying the cotton policy may improve the situation with
   farm incomes and food production, and reduce pressure on water
   resources, the availability of which in Central Asia is expected to
   decrease. To conduct an ex ante analysis of cotton policy modifications
   intended to improve rural incomes, a bio-economic optimization model was
   developed at the level of a water users association in the Khorezm
   region of Uzbekistan. Policy simulations showed that abolishing the
   current cotton policy would be a more economically attractive option for
   farmers and also increase grain production rather than various forms of
   this policy modification. However, abolishing the current cotton policy
   can present pressure on irrigation water resources as farmers would opt
   to cultivate water-intensive crops, thus requiring supplemental policies
   and institutions for sustainable resources use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The concept of a green economy is widely popular and is the basis of
   sustainable development strategies in many developed and developing
   countries. However, there is little knowledge on how `green' priorities
   are being integrated into regional and local development. The present
   research evaluates progress in the development of a green economy at the
   regional level by constructing a composite index (hereinafter CI) which
   allows to comprehensively characterize and consider the links and
   interactions between the economy and the environment in specific areas.
   The research substantiates the choice of 5 directions of assessment and
   14 indicators, and an algorithm for assessing the CI is proposed. The CI
   was calculated for 9 regions of Russia, China and Kazakhstan, adjacent
   to the territory of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (formerly
   OBOR). The developed toolkit makes it possible to analyze the features
   of ecological and economic interaction in the regions, to rank them
   according to the degree of making the economies green.},

Abstract = {Exports from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (RUK) help to improve global
   wheat availability and, hence, global food security. During the past 15
   years, however, RUK wheat exports have shown high variability, mainly
   because they have been repeatedly diminished by severe harvest failures.
   We present an outlook for RUK wheat production and exports up to 2027,
   taking into account possible yield variability and harvest failures, and
   focusing on the impact on food security in the Middle East and North
   Africa (MENA), the world's major wheat importing region. For the
   analysis we use the stochastic version of the Aglink-Cosimo model.
   Simulation results show that wheat yields in RUK are a major source of
   uncertainty for international wheat markets. The projected substantial
   increases in world market prices due to limited RUK wheat exports
   threaten food security in MENA and highlight the need for both
   stabilising RUK yields and novel complementary food security approaches
   to decrease MENA's vulnerability to disruptions in agricultural world
   markets.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to study global standards, recommendations
   developed by the international-al community, the experience of advanced
   foreign countries in the selection and training of candidates for
   judges, and to justify recommendations for its use in the Republic of
   Kazakhstan. The article examines various models of national systems for
   the preparation of judicial candidates. The authors con-clouded that
   there is no single standard m the training of judges, each country has
   its own approach, depending on the characteristics of the legal system,
   historical traditions. Nevertheless, the standards developed by the
   international community are the benchmark of proven approaches to
   improving the quality of judicial personnel. The current model of
   training judges in the Republic of Kazakhstan does not filly meet the
   requirements of the time and the ambitious strategic goals set by the
   country. Unlike the standards enshrined in the international act and the
   laws of foreign countries in which there is a comprehensive system of
   preliminary training of candidates for judges, in Kazakhstan, in fact,
   there is no systematic training of candidates for judges. The
   institution of the candidate for the judge is not formalized. Existing
   forms of education do not allow fully and systematically to Silly
   prepare candidates for judges for their professional activities. This is
   largely due to the poor quality of administration of justice, judicial
   errors, low level of public and business confidence in the judicial
   system. The directions for improving the Kazakhstani system of selection
   and training of candidates for judges were justified, taking into
   account international best practices: introducing the institution of
   candidates for the office of judge, establishing a constitutional
   requirement for mandatory preliminary training for all candidates for
   judges in a specialized educational institution - the Academy of Justice
   at the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan , with the payment of
   proper salaries to the trainees. Such training should be carried out at
   the very last stage of the selection of candidates for judges. It is
   necessary to improve the principle of `judges teach judges{''} by
   involving experienced judges in their teaching, with their separation
   from their main work.},

Abstract = {This article examines the link between logistics indicators and economic
   growth in Kazakhstan in the period 1995-2019. Factors and the causal
   relationship between the indicators of transport development and
   economic growth, using the models of total production, demand and vector
   error correction, are studied. The analysis established specifics of the
   relationship between indicators of various types of transport and
   economic growth and their mutual influence, both in terms of directions
   and the nature of the relationship. A bi-directional cause-and-effect
   relationship between railway transport infrastructure and economic
   growth has been identified according to the Granger test. It was found
   that in a small economy, road and sea transport in the long term will
   lead to a higher rate of economic growth, and vice versa, economic
   growth encourages the development of pipeline transport and this in
   turn, in a one-way direction, stimulates the development of all other
   types of transport. It was revealed that economic growth in Kazakhstan
   leads to an increase in demand for transport and logistics services and
   their infrastructure to a lesser extent than in countries with large
   economies. To improve the effectiveness of the economy, a differentiated
   approach to transport policy is recommended depending on the highlighted
   long-term relationship between the studied parameters. Our research
   indicates that conditions for road and sea transport in Kazakhstan
   should be improved to stimulate economic growth. The results of the
   study can be used as recommendations for developing a long-term
   transport policy.},

Abstract = {The rational use and protection of soils in market conditions requires
   adequate application of new scientific and methodological approaches.
   One of such systematic-analytical methods of soil cadastre organizations
   is a combination of traditional terrestrial methods with technologies of
   geoinformation systems (GIS) based on extensive use of satellite images
   in different resolutions. The aggregate of information necessary for
   mapping soil cover patterns and their quantification has been described
   in GIS databases. Data integration has been realized through the spatial
   and attributive component in the form of: the results of topographic and
   thematic maps. At the same time, the creation of attributive GIS
   databases involves the digitization of thematic maps tied into a single
   cartographic projection (as a topographic map with a scale of 1: 50
   000). As a result of the study, thematic maps and attributive databases
   of GIS of soils were formed. As a result of research, based on GIS
   technology, a digital soil map of the Akshat rural county of the

Abstract = {Principle of method is in the analysis of external environment for key
   factors and their combining for creating alternative development
   scenarios. Alternatives formed in the scenario approach allow
   identifying an aggregate of possible directions of environment
   development and thus create a basis for making strategic decisions. This
   paper considers theoretical and methodological basis of scenario
   planning, including various approaches and methods of scenario
   formation. Experience of this method application in Kazakhstan and
   abroad was studied.
   The paper identifies natural factors affecting water-supply conditions.
   Advisability of forming external environment development scenarios was
   justified for further development of alternative strategies for
   hydrogeological survey improvement. Based on the algorithm of forming
   and transboundary levels until 2030 of the proposed principles,
   scenarios were developed for creating plans of sustainable water-supply
   under conditions of climatic and anthropogenic changes at the regional,
   national and transboundary levels.
   In order to develop strategies and scenarios, as well as to identify
   vulnerabilities and negative impacts of climate change, it is necessary
   to have complete information and data on the entire basin. Therefore, it
   is necessary to collect and share the necessary information, data and
   models related to the basin as a whole, as well as all components of the
   water cycle. Managing the process of adaptation to climate change, it is
   necessary to monitor the situation and regularly update assessments,
   climate change scenarios and forecasts of the state of the water
   balance.
   Climate change should be considered as one of the main causes of changes
   in the environment of water basins, and as one of the many factors that
   put pressure on water resources. Therefore, adaptation scenarios for
   specific basins should take into account not only climate change, but
   also changes in the demographic situation, economic growth dynamics,
   dietary preferences, and so on. These scenarios should be developed with
   the greatest possible cooperation with neighboring countries, and most
   importantly, using data and models that are consistent with them.},

Abstract = {Introduction and aimsIntimate partner violence (IPV) and other forms of
   gender-based violence (GBV) are serious public health threats among
   women who use drugs or engage in binge drinking in Kyrgyzstan. This
   study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a
   two-session IPV and GBV screening, brief intervention and referral to
   treatment model (WINGS) with HIV counselling and testing for women who
   use drugs or engage in binge drinking in Kyrgyzstan, using a
   pre/post-design.
   Design and methodsWe screened 109 women from harm reduction
   non-government organisations in Kyrgyzstan, of whom 78 were eligible, 73
   participated in the intervention study, and 66 completed a 3-month
   post-intervention follow-up. To assess the effects of the intervention,
   we used random-effect Poisson and Logistic regression analyses for
   continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively.
   ResultsAt baseline, 73\% reported any physical or sexual IPV
   victimisation, and 60\% reported any physical or sexual GBV
   victimisation in the past year. At the 3-month follow-up, participants
   reported experiencing 59\% fewer physical IPV incidents in the prior
   90days than at baseline (P<0.001) and 27\% fewer physical GBV incidents
   than at baseline (P<0.01). From baseline to the 3-month follow-up,
   participants also reported a 65\% reduction in the odds of using any
   illicit drugs (P<0.05) and were more likely to report receiving
   GBV-related services (P<0.001).
   Discussion and conclusionThe high rates of participation, attendance and
   retention and significant reductions in IPV and GBV victimisation and
   drug use from baseline to the 3-month follow-up suggest the feasibility
   and promising effects of this brief intervention. {[}Gilbert L,

Abstract = {Study related to the extractive sector still plays a limited role in the
   mainstream international business (IB) and management literature, with
   even less focus on ongoing liberalization and digitalization in the
   industry. This article was motivated by the question of how
   collaboration between foreign and indigenous oil and gas (O\&G)
   companies can support small-sized and medium-sized indigenous
   technological development. The main contribution of this article is the
   development of a model that explains how different actors can cocreate
   value in the ecosystem of the O\&G industry through digital
   technologies. A three-stage qualitative-interpretive method based on
   interviews with industry experts was adopted to build three vignette
   case studies. This article proposes what companies and the government
   could do to increase the competitiveness of the local economy, diversify
   from O\&G into high technological industries, and support industrial
   development through information and communication technologies (ICT).},

Abstract = {In modern conditions, it is interesting to study foresight as an
   effective tool for identifying new strategic scientific directions. Its
   purpose is to develop an algorithm for conducting qualitative expertise
   in the application of the foresight methods with the ability to
   integrate forecast estimates. Currently, the vast majority of research
   activities results do not contribute to the innovative development of
   the state. To solve this problem, it is necessary to ensure a stable
   systemic relationship between specific sectors of the economy and higher
   education. The algorithm is developed on the basis of a systematic
   approach to the foresight methods and the use of the methods of
   bibliometrics, scientometrics, patent analysis and forecasting. The
   results and conclusions of this study are: an algorithm has been
   developed for conducting qualitative examination of the results of
   scientific activities in order to increase its practical significance,
   in which the authors propose the foresight methods as the most optimal
   tool for choosing priority areas of science and technology. Putting this
   approach into practice will make it possible to increase the efficiency
   of the foresight methods by both reducing time costs, and rationally
   using monetary and human resources.},

Abstract = {In the large-scale irrigation schemes of the lower Ili River Basin of
   Kazakhstan, crop rotation combines paddy rice and non-rice crops.
   Continuous irrigation is practiced in paddy fields, whereas other crops
   are sustained from groundwater after only limited early irrigation. The
   water table in non-rice crops is raised by seepage from canals and the
   flooded paddy fields. We investigated the areal extent to which the
   groundwater level of non-irrigated fields is influenced by seepage from
   canals and paddy fields by examining the relationship between distance
   (from canal and paddy field) and groundwater level in upland fields. The
   groundwater level was influenced for up to 300 and 400 m from the canals
   and paddy fields, respectively. Geographic information system analysis
   of crop and canal patterns in the 11 selected years showed that if the
   zone of influence is 300 and 400 m from the canals and paddy fields,
   respectively, the groundwater level of most of the area of upland fields
   was raised by seepage. We conclude that the water supply to cropping
   fields by seepage from irrigation canals and paddy fields is adequate,
   but the spatial distribution of the paddy fields may be an important
   factor that needs more attention to help improve water use efficiency in
   this irrigation district.},

   practices},

Abstract = {The issue of developing effective legal regulation of waste management
   and implementation of best practices in this area is relevant for many
   countries of the world. In the Republic of Kazakhstan, the development
   of a regulatory framework for waste management is still in its infancy.
   This situation poses a potential threat to the environment and public
   health. The question of this study is what are the obstacles to the
   effective implementation of international agreements in the field of
   waste management in Kazakhstan? What international legal instruments in
   the field of waste management are not fully used and what legislative
   initiatives need to be implemented in this regard? In order to assess
   the applicability of their regulations to the conditions of Kazakh law,
   the study examines such supranational legal instruments as, in
   particular, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary
   Movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the Espoo Convention,
   Directive (EU) 2018/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
   As this study suggests, an impending problem for Kazakhstan is the issue
   of utilization of WEEE and the implementation of the Basel Convention
   regarding the issue of transportation and disposal of WEEE. Despite the
   growing interest in the issues of proper waste management, mechanisms
   related to the implementation of the Espoo Convention and the Aarhus
   Convention are poorly implemented in Kazakhstan. This study uses the
   method of political and legal analysis, with the help of which it
   examines the problems of the effectiveness of the implementation of
   international agreements in the field of waste management in the
   Republic of Kazakhstan and ways to overcome them. To achieve these
   goals, international legislative acts in the field of environmental
   protection and the legislation of the European Union and EU member
   states were analyzed, which made it possible to determine the
   possibility of applying foreign practices on legal regulation of waste
   management and implementation of international legal acts mechanisms in
   Kazakhstan. The study attempts to give a qualitative assessment of the
   elaboration of the legislative regulation of the waste management sphere
   in Kazakhstan. The solution of problems in the field of waste management
   at the state level can be feasible only with a systemic rather than
   partial reform of the legal framework. Based on the EU practices in the
   implementation of international and supranational environmental
   agreements, the optimal combination of state and market instruments
   would improve the regulatory framework of Kazakhstan in the field of
   waste management. In order to create the most beneficial effect in
   countering the accumulation of waste without harming the economy, it
   would be useful to apply proactive and preventive approaches to increase
   the responsibility and participation of all stakeholder groups.},

Abstract = {Interaction between countries, the necessity of strengthening
   intercultural ties and overcoming stereotypes and prejudices are among
   the key focus areas studied by researchers. The most interesting periods
   are those connected with civilizational fractures, when the influence of
   dominant cultures, colonial expansions in particular, had both positive
   and destructive impact on local traditions and customs. This article
   looks at the historical experience of interactions between traditional
   Kazakh society and neighbouring countries from the 19th to the early
   20th century. The authors seek answers to the following questions: what
   response mechanisms could have been used for adaptation and preservation
   of unique characteristics of a certain culture? It is necessary to
   identify the role of religion in the development of religious education
   since as the Russian Empire expanded its colonies to the East it
   incorporated territories of countries that had practiced Islam for
   several centuries? The historical experience of coexistence of different
   peoples in this region shows that harmonious interaction between
   Christianity and Islam is possible.},
