Abstract = {Journalism faces a series of ethics crises, particularly in Central Asia
   because journalism is marked by wide ethical misbehavior including lack
   of balance and impartiality, using multiple fake names, selling and/or
   buying news, bribing journalists and others. This study analyzes
   professional ethical perspectives and practices of Central Asian
   journalists by examining and comparing the four former Soviet republics
   of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan Table 1. This
   study uses in-depth interviews with 24 journalists to examine their
   ethical ideals in the profession and how their ethical perspectives
   impact potential democracy. Its significance lies in revealing the
   gravity of ethical misbehavior where journalists call ethics a ``Western
   luxury{''} and where public life was filled with falsehoods.},

Abstract = {Unique cultural, historical, archeological, and natural attractions of
   Central Asian States (CAS) (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,
   Uzbekistan) present important opportunities for those states to become a
   major tourist destination. However, turning these opportunities and
   potential into a reality is likely to be a result of a long, expensive,
   and complicated process. The success of this process heavily relies on
   the availability of capital, both domestic and foreign. Since domestic
   capital is limited in many of the Central Asian States, it is likely
   that foreign capital is going to play a significant role. Therefore,
   this study examines the foreign investors' perceptions of general
   investment, tourism specific investment, and sustainability investment
   consideration factors in CAS. The study also tested if overall
   investment conditions of the four CAS can be explained as a function of
   general investment, tourism-specific investment, and tourism sustainable
   investment consideration factors. The study concludes with appropriate
   management and policy implications for both investors and the four CAS.

Abstract = {This paper examines the experiences of educational researchers
   undertaking fieldwork within three Central Asian countries - Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Drawing on interviews with educational
   researchers from within and outside the region, the findings show that
   researchers encounter numerous ethical and methodological challenges in
   the process of gaining access to sites and participants, in data
   collection and in dissemination of findings. Many of them stem from a
   persistence of Soviet style controls, an underdeveloped research culture
   and use of standard research ethics guidelines. However, I argue that
   not all challenges can be blamed on the context of these countries, but
   in some cases neglect in proper planning and implementation of research
   is another reason for some challenges faced by researchers. The paper
   shows that some of the dilemmas and challenges faced by researchers are
   not unique to Central Asia, but ones that are also encountered in other
   countries.},

Title = {Impact of Remittances and International Migration on Poverty in Central
   Asia: The cases of the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-56},
Abstract = {Several studies have hitherto examined the impact of remittances and
   international migration on poverty in the developing world. However, the
   Central Asian region remains under-researched, with no country
   comparison study examining the impact of remittances on poverty in the
   region. This paper fills this research gap by analyzing a new dataset on
   remittances, international migration, and poverty from the Kyrgyz
   Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The results show that both
   international migration and remittances significantly reduce poverty in
   these Central Asian countries. The main issue with the standard
   empirical approach is potential endogeneity of migration and remittances
   in the model of poverty, as income has been suggested to be a
   significant factor in migration decisions. In practice, instrumental
   variables are rarely a convincing and as well as efficient solution.
   Therefore, we estimate the total effect of migration and remittances
   instead of that at the margin. Results show differences between current
   actual poverty rates and those under a simulated no-migration scenario.

Abstract = {This article compares key issues concerning the structure of
   microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the nature of competition in
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Employing both qualitative and quantitative
   measures, the field research indicates that MFIs in Tajikistan and
   Uzbekistan do not have the traditional characteristics of microfinance
   business. Although both countries are at the pre-competitive stage, the
   qualitative research indicates that urban areas in Tajikistan are
   approaching a competitive edge. The research demonstrates that MFIs in
   these countries do not require their clients to give up membership of
   other MFIs, thus increasing the probability of cross-indebtedness.
   Moreover, if a client fails to repay a loan from one MFI, there is a
   high probability that this person will join another MFI. Consequently,
   both countries may face cross-indebtedness even in the absence of
   intensive competition.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {228-246},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the money attitudes
   among students at English-language business schools in the transitioning
   Central Asian nations of the former USSR, namely, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
   and Uzbekistan.
   Design/methodology/approach The survey was carried out in 2017, using
   previously established measures of Love of Money survey questionnaire.
   Over 300 undergraduate students in English-language business degree
   programs in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan participated in the
   survey. A few hypotheses were tested using three-way MANOVA to test the
   influence of three factors (country, gender and student years). In
   addition, post hoc analysis, and one- and two-way ANOVA methods were
   used for multiple comparisons.
   Findings The results showed evidence of increasing convergence among
   students who are farther along in the program. Some statistically
   significant differences were also found, mainly in regard to gender
   differences in money attitudes across countries and student levels. The
   results of statistical analysis suggest a need for further research on
   attitudes and values related to money in the modern nation states of
   Central Asia.
   Originality/value This study is one of first attempts to study the
   values and attitudes regarding money among the first generation of
   business students who were born and grew up after their respective
   countries gained independence. The findings imply the development of a
   relatively homogeneous labor pool for business organizations across
   regions that are characterized by increasing differentiation among
   countries within the region.},

Abstract = {Given the present conditions of demographic growth and the complicated
   transition toward market economies in Central Asia, the problems of food
   security and designing policies to achieve it without compromising
   economic growth are at the forefront of policy agendas in these
   countries. This paper reviews food policy reforms in Uzbekistan, the
   Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan in the context of sustainable
   agricultural development. Analyzing the trends in the agricultural
   sector during the transition period, it identifies the major impacts of
   policy reforms on food security and enumerates future challenges for
   improving food security in these countries. It finds that despite the
   progress made in reforming their economies toward market-oriented ones,
   the three countries continue to face food insecurity to varying degrees.
   It concludes that there is an urgent need to further expand and deepen
   the reform process by enabling functioning land, labor, and financial
   markets. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Title = {Framing ethnic minority mobilisation in Central Asia: The cases of

Journal = {EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand why, although widely predicted, very
   little ethnically motivated political mobilisation has occurred in
   post-Soviet Central Asia. Building on the contribution of frame
   analysis, the article examines the case of Uzbek communities in
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Different frames have been articulated by the
   elites and have been used to mobilise and demobilise the Community. The
   more successful ones (those that resonated) were less confrontational,
   and ultimately led the Uzbek communities towards a non-confrontational
   path with the authorities. The article concludes that frame analysis
   sheds important insights on the process of the mobilisation of ethnic
   minorities in Central Asia, and also contributes to the literature on
   ethnic mobilisation.},

Journal = {ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {304-322},
Abstract = {This paper aims to reconstruct widely accepted concepts of the top-down
   authoritarian nature of Central Asian politics in Kazakhstan and
   Uzbekistan through a comparative study of the pro-democratic movements
   that emerged in the late 1980s. By analysing data from interviews with
   the cultural elites of the late Soviet perestroika period and data on
   the indigenous nationalist movements such as Erk, Zheltoksan, Birlik and
   others, we question why such nationalist movements did not ``survive{''}
   or emerge as a significant political platform as promised in
   post-independence Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and why they failed to
   change the political outlook of one party rule or the dominance of one
   nationalising regime. Furthermore, we analyse how such nationalist
   movements had an opportunity to turn into semi-democratic movements but
   failed to transform after their agenda (arguably, independence) was
   achieved, leaving ``communists-turned-nationalists{''} to continue their
   policies in newly formed countries. Thus, the paper also looks at how
   these cultural elites eventually contributed to the local
   ``authoritarianism{''} and lack of plurality in views and
   identifications.},

Title = {The diploma disease in Central Asia: students' views about purpose of

Journal = {STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1183-1196},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {This paper examines students' views about the purpose of university
   education and its role in their future employability in Kazakhstan and
   Tajikistan. Data was gathered through focus groups with 172
   undergraduate students. Findings suggest that due to socio-economic
   pressures, students largely see the purpose of university in terms of
   its economic value, namely enhanced access to employment opportunities
   and improved financial wellbeing. While future career prospects are key
   motivation to pursue a university degree, this study shows that the
   perceived role of university credentials in employability is declining.
   Due to an oversupply of graduates and limited employment opportunities,
   employers have raised the bar for qualifications to select job
   candidates. Coupled with an undergraduate degree perceived as an
   `incomplete degree', students are driven to earn more educational
   credentials; leading to a greater supply of graduates and what appears
   to be a widespread occurrence of `diploma disease'.},

Title = {Revisiting the role of civic organizations in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
   and Tajikistan: Confidence, membership, and democratic practice},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT},
Abstract = {In many emerging and authoritarian countries, civil society
   organizations that focus on political or sensitive policy issues are
   being cracked down upon, while service-oriented ones are given a
   relatively greater ability to operate. What might the consequence of
   this be for democratic practice given the important role civic
   organizations play in this process? We examine this question by
   considering whether the absence of confidence in a country's governing
   institutions is related to membership in service-rather than
   governance-focused civic organizations, and how such membership is
   associated with elite-challenging, political activities in Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. We find that individuals who have no
   confidence in state institutions are less likely to seek membership in
   governance-focused civic organizations, but not necessarily in
   service-focused ones. At the same time, membership in both types of
   civic organizations is associated with participation in political
   activities, while beliefs that a country is run democratically decreases
   it. This suggests that a variety of civic organizational types, even
   those without an explicit governance-focus, contingent on perceptions of
   democratic governance and other covariates held constant, enhance
   democratic practice.},

Journal = {ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {620-642},
Abstract = {Using data from nationally representative public opinion surveys done in
   2005 in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the authors focus on the titular
   groups as well as the Russians in both countries and provide assessments
   of their perceived ethnic commonalities with one another and with
   various other ethnic groups, including Uzbeks and Jews in each country.
   The results indicate that there are hierarchies of intergroup
   differentiations that help to delineate the boundaries of ethnic
   identities in both countries. Multivariate analyses show the systematic
   effects of regional variables in shaping these ethnic boundaries. The
   basic topographies of the boundaries are consistent with the effects of
   social identification processes and the relative power and social
   standings of the different target ethnic groups across the regions. Our
   results lend clear support to the ethnic boundaries paradigm by
   underscoring that ethnic boundaries can be independent of objective
   commonalities and can vary according to contexts.},

Abstract = {This study uses a quasi-experimental evaluation of national surveys in
   post-Soviet Central Asia to quantify the impact of children's enrollment
   into childcare programs on the quality of parent-child interactions. The
   main finding is that the presence of childcare for a family is
   positively and significantly associated with an increase in the quality
   of parent-child interactions in every country under investigation. In
   Kyrgyzstan, enrollment in childcare is associated with a 5.6 unit
   increase in the index of quality of parent-child interactions.
   Similarly, in Tajikistan childcare enrollment is associated with a 6.5
   unit increase in the index, while in Uzbekistan with a 3.2 unit
   increase. Several other variables are also important in explaining
   parent-child interaction. Living in rural areas increases the quality of
   parent-child interactions in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, while an
   increase in the number of children under 14 in the household has an
   opposite effect. Being a Russian-speaker is associated with an increase
   in the quality of parent-child interactions in Kyrgyzstan and
   Uzbekistan. Lastly, an increase in the mother's and children's ages is
   associated with lower levels of interaction quality in Tajikistan, but
   the magnitude of this effect is relatively small. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Among low-income transition reformers, natural resource rents are an
   important initial condition that helps explain choice of reform
   strategy. Resource-rich Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and resource-poor
   China and Vietnam all claim to pursue gradual reform, but their
   strategies differ. In China and Vietnam, low resource rents have
   nurtured developmental political conditions and encouraged efficient
   resource use, which initially promoted agriculture as a dynamic market
   sector, capable of absorbing labour from the lagging state sector. In
   contrast, the scale and ease of natural resource rent extraction in the
   Central Asian countries has consolidated authoritarian governments that
   postpone reform. Despite high energy rents, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
   still extract agricultural rents in ways that repress farm incentives,
   perpetuate environmental degradation and liquidate irrigation assets.
   Uzbekistan uses its rents to subsidize a manufacturing sector, that is
   neither dynamic nor competitive. As its dynamic sector, Turkmenistan
   promotes natural gas exports that depend on volatile markets.
   Resource-driven development models suggest that reform is required in
   both countries to avert a growth collapse. Turkmenistan's large energy
   rent-stream may postpone a collapse for some years, but Uzbekistan's
   position is already precarious: it has run down its rural infrastructure
   and accumulated sizeable foreign debts and will require external
   assistance to recover from a growth collapse. Such assistance should be
   made conditional on accelerated economic and political reform.},

   Typically understood as being irrelevant, this article argues to the
   contrary that parties play an important role in the mosaic of
   authoritarian rule via the articulation of private interests. Examining
   Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan this study identifies two models
   of party interest articulation: a leveraging model where a party is
   utilized to protect the financial and political interests of elites; and
   a coordinating model where a party serves to integrate presidential
   assets. Neither model is uniform and party dynamics are dependent upon
   the specific nature of each personalist regime.},

Abstract = {What happens to elites when the personalistic leader they supported for
   so long suddenly dies? This article tackles comparatively transitions
   out of first presidencies in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, presenting an
   analytical framework that seeks to explain why these transitions
   unfolded in relatively smooth fashion. The overall stability defining
   power transfer processes instigated by the non-violent death of
   personalistic rulers in both contexts is explained here through the
   intersection of three key factors: the regimes' resort to succession
   practices consolidated in the Soviet era, the emergence of temporary
   forms of collective decision-making in both transitional contexts, and
   the implementation of de-personalisation strategies pursuing the
   obliteration of specific pockets of cadres but stopping short of wider
   regime re-organisation. The findings of this article contribute to
   broader debates on the politics of de-personalisation, while putting
   forward a comprehensive framework to analyse transitions out of
   personalism in and beyond post-Soviet Eurasia.},

Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to count the number
   of international program accreditations at universities in Kyrgyzstan
   and Kazakhstan; and second, to understand why Kazakhstan has
   dramatically more such accreditations. Design/methodology/approach The
   methodology included identifying agencies working in each country,
   reviewing data on their websites, and analyzing government documents and
   relevant literature. Findings Findings were that Kazakhstan has 645
   international program accreditations and Kyrgyzstan has 9. Analysis of
   the reasons for this difference includes strong government support and
   incentives for internationalization of higher education in Kazakhstan,
   furthering the government's goal of becoming one of the world's 30 most
   developed economies by 2050; Kazakhstan's financial wherewithal to
   support internationalization policies; and its membership in the Bologna
   Process. In Kyrgyzstan, on the other hand, few rewards result from the
   costly and time-consuming process of international accreditation; only
   programs with existing international connections or institutions with
   large international student populations seem interested. Research
   limitations/implications Limitations are that the research was based on
   document analysis and did not include interviews with staff of programs
   seeking international accreditation. Practical implications One
   implication, i.e., international program accreditation, while an
   indicator of program quality, also denotes the financial and
   infrastructural wherewithal to carry it out, plus the perceived benefits
   and costs of doing so. Originality/value The value of this research is
   that it analyzes the reasons for divergence and different results in two
   countries that, 25 years ago, were part of the same higher education
   system.},

   to solve its key problems. The current study employs the growth
   diagnostic approach proposed by Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco (2005,

   Government, Harvard University) to identify binding constraints on
   growth. This article finds that weak institutional performance, high

Abstract = {Strengthening the state is central to the post-communist reform agenda.
   Here, state capacity combines organisational, material and social

   applied to a comparative, survey-based analysis in 2002 of 125
   medium-ranking officials in two post- communist Central Asian countries,
   Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The findings reveal that although
   Kazakhstan's controlled economic reform programme and natural resources
   have placed it in a stronger position to develop its state capacity,
   important ideational, political and implementational problems pose
   long-term obstacles for reform. In turn, Kyrgyzstan's early
   liberalisation in the absence of economic and social resources may be
   serving to undermine its state capacity.},

Abstract = {Pluralism recognizes diversity and aims to facilitate peaceful
   coexistence across a variety of interests and convictions. Across
   Central Asia, states have become increasingly authoritarian and in turn
   less favorable to implementing political and legal structures commonly
   seen as necessary for pluralism. The question about the potential for
   pluralism in Central Asia, however, is different from one on how to
   build pluralism. In this article, I argue that despite the
   less-than-sanguine prospects for pluralism to emerge across the region,
   pluralism can be built through programming that engages difference and
   creates new solidarities around shared experience, without the
   insistence on shared meaning.},

   formally committed to an official trilingual language policy - Kazakh,

   policy - Kyrgyz and Russian. However, its Ministry of Education and
   Science has demonstrated an informal commitment to developing English
   competency in-country through various English language teaching/learning
   initiatives. Using data collected between 2014 and 2017 in both
   countries, this article explores how English language teaching/learning
   is positioned differently in these two Central Asian Republics, while
   also aiming to understand how participants' language choices were
   informed both by the particularities of their contexts and the
   intersectional nature of language choice.},

Abstract = {In order to explain why civil war erupted in Tajikistan but not in
   Uzbekistan this article assesses a range of theories that have sought to
   explain the occurrence of civil wars. After assessing the strengths and
   weaknesses of a number of these different existing approaches in the
   comparative literature, it argues that the eruption of civil war in
   Tajikistan and its absence in Uzbekistan can be explained by adapting
   ideas from bargaining theories of war that have been developed in the
   literature on international relations. It argues that it is important to
   study the adversaries' perceptions of power in relation to the actions
   that led to the civil war and how the perceptions of the distribution of
   power are influenced by structural, process and network-related
   variables. Consistent with bargaining theories of war, a disparity
   between the distribution of power and distribution of benefits seems an
   important factor in the eruption of civil war in Tajikistan.},

Journal = {Regional Environmental Change},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {2369-2387},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Reduced river runoff and expected upstream infrastructural developments
   are both potential threats to irrigation water availability for the
   downstream countries in Central Asia. Although it has been recurrently
   mentioned that a reduction in water supply will hamper irrigation in the
   downstream countries, the magnitude of associated economic losses,
   economy-wide repercussions on employment rates, and degradation of
   irrigated lands has not been quantified as yet. A computable general
   equilibrium model is used to assess the economy-wide consequences of a
   reduced water supply in Uzbekistan-a country that encompasses more than
   half of the entire irrigated croplands in Central Asia. Modeling
   findings showed that a 10-20 \% reduction in water supply, as expected
   in the near future, may reduce the areas to be irrigated by
   241,000-374,000 hectares and may cause unemployment to a population of
   712-868,000, resulting in a loss for the national income of 3.6-4.3 \%.
   A series of technical, financial, and institutional measures,
   implementable at all levels starting from the farm to the basin scale,
   are discussed for reducing the expected water risks. The prospects of
   improving the basin-wide water management governance, increasing water
   and energy use efficiency, and establishing the necessary legal and
   institutional frameworks for enhancing the introduction of needed
   technological and socioeconomic change are argued as options for gaining
   more regional water security and equity.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, China's diplomatic, economic, security and
   multilateral relations with Resource-Rich Countries (RRCs) in general,
   and with Central Asia and the Caspian Region (CACR) in particular,
   created a regional web of complementarity connecting states and
   societies. This trend reflects a dimension of the ``statist
   globalization{''} of the Chinese economy. Chinese National Oil Companies
   (CNOCs) are powerful actors within this emerging network. This comes as
   no surprise, as China's domestic power-wealth structure relies on
   uninterrupted foreign (energy) supplies. The main aim of this paper will
   be to present a geopolitical economic reflection on China's post-Cold
   War energy relations with the RRCs of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Our
   theoretical framework, which stems from critical geopolitics, tries to
   conceptualize the geopolitical economic policy tools used by China's
   ruling class in RRCs in general and the two cases in particular.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the emergence of and practices related to corporate

   corporate social responsibility policies with relevance to the mining
   industry and the post-socialist context are first reviewed. The roles of
   the national and local contexts in the formation of the CSR practices
   are then investigated. The differences of the emergent CSR models in
   these two countries are analyzed, as well as the underlying factors for
   the differences or similarities. It is concluded that despite the shared
   Soviet legacy, the CSR policies of the mining companies have clearly
   been diverging in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The difference emerges from
   the ways in which the mining companies adapt their CSR practices to the
   different sets of stakeholders. The CSR practices are influenced
   strongly by the national context in which the mining operations are
   conducted. The study shows that CSR activities of the mining industry
   should be analyzed as consisting of global commitments on the one hand,
   and varying forms of national and local scale implementations on the
   other hand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Why do counterterrorism policies of the Central Asian states grow more
   alike amid propensities for divergence? This article engages with this
   question. It focuses on the counterterrorism measures of Kyrgyzstan and
   attributes their growing intensity to influence of the neighboring
   states and regional organizations. It is the contention of this research
   that Kyrgyzstan's increasingly vigorous responses aimed at combating
   terrorism are a part of a broader process of convergence of
   counterterrorism policies and measures targeting religious extremism
   adopted by Kyrgyzstan's neighbors. The three mechanisms that lie at the
   roots of this process are direct coercive transfer, harmonization of
   security policies, and emulation of counterterrorism responses.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of agricultural policy reforms and their
   impact on food security in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Owing to
   increasing hostility in regional trade among the countries of Central
   Asia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, like their neighbors, have chosen to
   follow a path of food self-sufficiency, which has biased their
   agricultural systems towards grain production. The paper finds that the
   land reforms in these two countries, which have dismantled the state
   farms, have resulted in reduced productivity of crops and declining food
   availability at the household level. It argues that reversing this trend
   will require increased investment in rural infrastructure and
   agricultural research to improve crop yields, and in the short-term,
   food security interventions to protect the poor and vulnerable. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are three post-Soviet countries,
   which are in varying degrees rich of energy resources. After gaining
   independence, oil and gas wealth were the main resources for overcoming
   acute economic stagnation, and later the formation of the economy itself
   in all of these countries. Even today, the energy sector is form base
   and essential in their economies.
   As from the declaration of independence of these three countries already
   twenty-seven years has passed, the energy strategy has become
   diversified and differ from each other. This is due to many factors,
   both internal and external. What factor affected this phenomenon will be
   explained in this article.
   Also in his article will provide information on the development of the
   energy sector in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, from the
   moment they gain independence until today. The specifics of the energy
   strategy development in each country will be highlighted and further a
   comparative analysis will be conducted, according to which common points
   and differences between these former republics of the Soviet Union will
   be determined. This will allow considering the prospect of further
   development of the energy sector both: in these countries and in other
   countries, whose economy is also mainly based on the energy sector.},

Abstract = {Two European geographers present the findings of a sizeable survey (n =
   7,5 15) providing a detailed geographical analysis of household incomes
   and reliance on personal subsidiary garden plots across Kazakhstan. The
   authors focus on assessing the extent to which Kazakhstan's rising GDP
   during the post-Soviet period has coincided with an increase in the
   general population's personal income and ability to secure adequate food
   supplies for personal consumption. The fine geographical scale of
   analysis of the survey data (significantly less coarse than oblast-level
   data) enabled them to identify regions characterized by
   ``trickle-down{''} income, largely centered on the country's two main
   urban centers and areas of resource exploitation. The patterns revealed
   in the paper have relevance to the debate concerning the uneven

   Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Agriculture in Central Asia faces tremendous challenges due to climate
   change. International agricultural trade is seen in the literature as a
   potential adaption to climate change. However, little attention has been
   paid to the effect of climate change on cereal trade in Central Asia.
   This study takes Kazakhstan as an example to empirically analyze the
   effect of climate change on cereal trade by including them as
   determinants in the gravity model. Our results show that climatic
   changes in Kazakhstan, measured by precipitation and temperature, could
   increase the export of wheat and rice and the import of maize, and
   decrease the import of wheat. Specifically, as a major crop in
   Kazakhstan, increasing precipitation by 1 millimeter during the major
   cropping season from May to August, will significantly enhance export of
   wheat by 0.7\% and reduce the import by 1.7\%; increasing temperature by
   1 degrees C during the same cropping season will significantly increase
   export of wheat by 21.9\% and reduce the import by 49.4\%. As an
   important cereal trade country in the world, the dramatic adjustments of
   cereal trade patterns resulting from climate change in Kazakhstan might
   affect global food security.},

Title = {Impacts of Various Connectivity Processes in Central Asia on Sustainable
   Development of Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan is facing a strategically important period in its history.
   The government's ambition of reindustrializing is affecting its
   engagement with various international organizations and donors. As these
   plans will lead to societal transition and affect such areas as social
   development, national economy, and environment, a careful consideration
   of their impacts is required, especially given the country's need to
   achieve sustainable development. At the same time, the geographical
   position of Kyrgyzstan puts it at the cross-roads of three distinct
   regional economic connectivity processes: the Eurasian Economic Union
   (EAEU), the China-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and various
   connectivity initiatives and projects taking place under the umbrella of
   the European Union (EU). A major issue is the extent to which Kyrgyzstan
   can leverage these processes to boost its economic revitalization plans
   and decarbonize its economy in line with international climate change
   mitigation and energy security policies, while ensuring a reliable
   energy supply. As a result, novel governance mechanisms need to be
   established that address the possible impacts of these economic
   connectivity processes; this is especially important given the
   frequently diverging perceptions and opinions of the various Kyrgyz and
   foreign stakeholders involved in industrial policymaking. Perceptual
   heterogeneity influences the development of solutions based on
   compromise and participatory governance that are crucial to implementing
   different industrial policy options; it also impacts the nature of the
   economic relationship between Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the
   Central Asian region. The aim of this paper is to understand the
   implications of perceptual heterogeneity for the various connectivity
   processes in Kyrgyzstan, their benefits, and their impacts. The
   methodology of this paper includes a variety of methods such as surveys
   and interviews with key stakeholders, scenario development, and
   participatory workshops in various regions of the country.},

Journal = {SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},

Pages = {294-319},
Abstract = {Attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) can affect the
   prevalence of IPV, response of victims' to IPV (e.g., whether to seek
   help), and the response of professionals (e.g., police, social workers,
   health care professionals) to IPV. Knowledge about IPV-related attitudes
   is essential for developing effective social work and violence-related
   programs. Using data from the 2005-2006 Multiple Indicator Cluster
   Surveys, this study examines attitudes toward IPV and socio-demographic
   predictors of these attitudes among married women in Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Women were asked whether they approved of a
   husband beating his wife: if she goes out without telling him, neglects
   their children, argues, refuses to have sex, and burns food. The
   prevalence of IPV acceptance for at least one of the five reasons varied
   from 12.3\% in Kazakhstan to 45.3\% in Kyrgyzstan and 74.5\% in
   Tajikistan. Women who were less educated, members of Asian ethnic
   groups, resided in middle-class urban areas, and lived in specific
   regions were more likely to accept IPV. Few age differences that emerged
   indicated that young women were more approving of IPV. Proactive efforts
   are needed to confront attitudes about gender roles and IPV in
   Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.},

Pages = {505-530},
Abstract = {Government warnings, media commentary, and the recent bombings in
   Uzbekistan suggest that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) may be
   renascent. Despite these concerns, the evidence suggests that the threat
   presented by the IMU remains manageable. Not only does the IMU lack both
   popular support and military strength, but the United States, Russia,
   and China have shown surprising solidarity in opposing a revival of
   Central Asian terrorism. This article first discusses the IMU's origins,
   structure, training, and financing. It then provides a detailed
   description of its activities in Central Asian countries. Despite its
   name, the IMU's membership roster includes a large number on non-Uzbeks,
   and the organization has been militarily active in much of Central Asia.
   The next section analyzes the policies of Russia, China, and the United
   States toward the IMU. The only partially successful attempts at
   regional cooperation against the organization are then discussed.
   Finally, the article reviews the debate over the appropriate U. S.
   policies toward the IMU and Central Asia.},

Abstract = {While the academic debate on security has broadened in recent years, it
   has failed to cohesively include transnational organized crime and drug
   trafficking as a security issue. However, especially in weak states in

   increasingly negative effect on security in the military, political,
   economic, and societal sense. Security issues in Central Asia are a
   prominentexantple of the links between drug trafficking and military
   threats to security. This is illustrated most clearly by the Islamic
   Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which has been both a major actor in the
   drug trade from Afghanistan to Central Asia as well as the most serious
   violent nonstate actor in the region. The link between the drug trade
   and armed conflict is of fundamental importance to understanding the

Abstract = {Analyzing data from the 2007 Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan Inequality
   Survey, I identify and compare the determinants of economic justice
   attitudes in two formerly similar majority-Muslim nations that are now
   distinguished almost exclusively by their dissimilar economic
   circumstances following the collapse of the Soviet Union, In Kazakhstan,
   where the economy is growing rapidly, the important factors predicting
   economic egalitarianism are connected to people's perceived ability to
   do well in the future. In contrast, in Kyrgyzstan, which has stagnated
   in the post-Soviet era, people's immediate economic vulnerability
   predicts egalitarianism, while their economic prospects are irrelevant.
   Finally, the effect of several factors on support for egalitarianism
   appears impervious to the prevailing economic winds: religious
   orthodoxy, the urban vs. rural divide, and membership in a historically
   privileged ethnic group. These patterns reflect both the commonalities
   in the two countries' histories, demography, and religion and their
   divergent economic trajectories since the collapse of the USSR.},

Abstract = {Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have new leaders for the first time since
   1989: Shavkat Mirziyoyev as Uzbek president and Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as
   Kazakh president. This article uses a theoretical framework based on the
   literatures of leadership change and political succession while
   overlaying this literature with the type of economic policies followed
   by each former leader to analyse the political and economic transitions
   in these countries. Mirziyoyev has legitimized his authority, even
   though he was not part of the elite, through reforms designed to help
   the people (as Karimov had envisioned in the `Uzbek way'). In contrast,
   Nazarbayev's policies were centred around the state as a facilitator of
   economic development, a problem for citizens in an economic downturn.
   While Tokayev transitioned through a formal electoral process, his was a
   `managed' designation, with the charismatic leader still in a formal
   position of power, leaving Tokayev without a separate base of
   legitimacy.},

Title = {Islamic finance in the post-Soviet Central Asia and Transcaucasia: the
   evidence from Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Purpose Over the past decades, Islamic finance has expanded its presence
   to many countries including Muslim-majority post-Soviet Central Asian
   and Transcaucasian region. Undoubtedly, this expansion has aroused keen
   interest among the representatives of a range of areas such as science,
   politics and business. The purpose of this paper is to describe the
   scope, the key players and the main investment strategies of the Islamic
   finance market based on the evidence obtained from Kyrgyzstan.
   Design/methodology/approach The main empirical corpus was formed from
   Bureau van Dijk's databases (Zephyr and Orbis) and includes
   approximately 80 deals involving Shariah-compliant investments in
   Kyrgyzstan from 1991 to 2020. The initial corpus was then significantly
   expanded by means of content analysis of open media sources. Being still
   insufficient for deeper generalization, these data were further
   complemented by the analysis of an array of corporate information (press
   releases, presentations and financial reports) related to the identified
   deals. To ensure the credibility of the conclusions to be made on the
   nature of Islamic finance in Kyrgyzstan, the desk analysis was also
   complemented with field research using qualitative method of in-depth
   expert interviews. Findings This paper has shown that despite the yet
   modest market volumes represented by Islamic bank, Islamic windows,
   Islamic leasing company and microfinance companies, Islamic finance in
   Kyrgyz Republic has further growth prospects, which are associated with
   the arrival of large foreign Islamic banks that bring innovative
   financial products, the issuance of Islamic securities (sukuk) and
   launch of Islamic insurance (takaful). Being more open and consistent in
   the development of Islamic finance industry, the authorities of
   Kyrgyzstan understand the need for the initial development of the market
   by their own forces. Originality/value This paper is original and
   up-to-date, as it contains new and significant information. Suggesting a
   new approach to studying Islamic finance in post-Soviet area, this paper
   identifies the most active Islamic investors in Kyrgyzstan, classifies
   them, reveals their investment strategies and assesses the financial
   performance of Islamic investors as well as the total volume of
   Shariah-compliant capital in Kyrgyzstan. The findings of this paper can
   contribute to shaping policies toward Islamic finance in the post-Soviet
   region and, therefore, may be beneficial to the development of Islamic
   finance industry.},

Pages = {358-365},
Abstract = {Background: Despite accumulating evidence on the disproportionate
   prevalence of different forms of gender-based violence among
   substance-involved women, financial or economic abuse has been
   understudied.Objectives: We examine the prevalence of economic abuse by
   intimate and non-intimate partners among a sample of 55
   substance-involved women in Kyrgyzstan, and the relationship between
   economic abuse and socio-demographic characteristics and other types of
   gender-based violence.Methods: Descriptive, bivariate, and correlation
   analyses are used to examine the main research questions.Results: 89\%
   of the sample experienced at least one incident of economic abuse in
   their lifetime by either an intimate or non-intimate partner. Subscale
   analyses revealed that 74.5\%, 85.5\%, and 63.6\% of women experienced
   at least one incident of economic exploitation, economic control, and
   employment sabotage in their lifetime, respectively. Bivariate analyses
   indicated significant associations between economic abuse and age,
   ethnicity, parental status, and injection drug use. Partner
   psychological abuse was correlated with economic control, whereas
   non-intimate partner psychological and physical violence were associated
   with economic exploitation and employment sabotage.Conclusions: Findings
   highlight an urgent need to include economic abuse in surveillance
   efforts, and the need to develop economic empowerment strategies for
   substance-involved women.},

Abstract = {This paper is the first comprehensive study to assess public
   environmental awareness on environmental issues in Nursultan (formerly
   known as Astana), the capital city of Kazakhstan. It employs a
   survey-based research methodology with a series of crossover
   assessments. Almost a quarter of the respondents stated that they have
   already begun waste separation, even though there is no penalty system
   if the waste is not separately collected or recycled. More or less all
   the respondents agreed that hazardous substances should be treated
   separately from other waste types. It was also found that the public
   perception of tap water quality is strongly related to personal
   experiences, which correspondingly influences the use of tap water as
   drinking water. As a result of the perceived water quality, bottled
   water is the preferred alternative drinking water option among the
   householders. Half of respondents recognised motor vehicles as the main
   cause of pollution.},

Abstract = {This article aims to present the situation of the Russian minority in

   in this country since independence in 1991. It develops three main
   points: the non-homogeneous nature of Russians in Kazakhstan; the
   development of non-ethnic allegiances that could explain the failure of
   the local Russian political parties; and the difficulties the leaders
   have in choosing between the defence of the political rights and the
   cultural rights of the country's first minority. In order to examine
   these issues, this article focuses on a series of issues: the place of
   the national question in the Kazakh public debate; the process of
   linguistic and ethnic Kazakhisation; the political activities of the
   Russian minority; the Cossack issue and the stakes of autonomist claims
   and, finally, the issue of emigration and the narrative of the `return'
   to Russia.},

   gender, genealogy and patrilineal kinship. Local meanings and uses of
   genealogy and history are shown to differ from those developed at the

   lineages and their heroes portray different sacred and social worlds

Abstract = {The political transformation of the Central Asian region has induced the
   implosion of the interconnected physical hydraulic infrastructure and
   its institutional management system. Land-locked Central Asian
   countries, with their climatic conditions and transboundary water
   resources, have been striving to meet their food security, to increase
   agricultural production, to sustain energy sectors, and to protect the
   environment. The existing water reservoirs are strategic infrastructures
   for irrigation and hydropower generation. Upstream countries (Tajikistan
   and Kyrgyzstan) favor the reservoirs' operation for energy supply, while
   downstream countries (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan) push for
   irrigation use. This paper provides an overview of the current
   challenges and perspectives (technical, institutional, and legal
   regulations) and presents recommendations for the sustainable management
   of man-made water reservoirs in Uzbekistan.},

Title = {Water reservoirs, irrigation and sedimentation in Central Asia: a

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Water reservoirs play an important role in areas with limited and
   erratic precipitation where water is stored and re-distributed later for
   different purposes. Irrigation is primarily a major water consumer in
   arid countries of Central Asia for the economic development, employment
   and food security of the region. The major rivers of Central Asia (e.g.,
   Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Zerafshan) are turbid watercourses.
   Sedimentation reduces the main reservoir asset i.e., its volume
   capacity. In addition, vast territories of the region's countries have
   been transformed for agriculture to grow water intensive crops such as
   cotton, rice and wheat during the Soviet Union that dramatically
   accelerated soil erosion by water and wind. Thus, many man-made water
   reservoirs are affected by high sedimentation rates. Moreover, uneven
   spatial and temporal water resources and a Soviet-inherited unified
   hydraulic infrastructure have raised transboundary reservoir management
   issues over water resources allocation among the countries in the region
   such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
   The rivers such as Syr Darya and Amu Darya are already regulated by more
   than 78 and 94 \%, respectively and attempts for new reservoir projects
   upstream raises increased concerns of the downstream countries (e.g.,
   the Rogun hydropower station in Tajikistan and the Toktogul reservoir in
   Kyrgyzstan). For instance, the uncoordinated use of reservoirs has
   caused the Arnasai lake problem in Uzbekistan with environmental,
   material damage and social unrest. The aim of this paper is first to
   review the present conditions and the role of man-made water reservoirs
   for irrigation in Central Asia with special focus on Uzbekistan, second
   to document past and current reservoir sedimentation conditions in
   Uzbekistan and third to discuss research carried out by Soviet and
   present-time local research community in the domain of erosion and
   sedimentation in the region.},

   three quarters of the goods imported by Kyrgyzstan have been
   unofficially re-exported to other Central Asian countries, generating
   substantial income for the Kyrgyz economy. A concluding section explores

Journal = {ARCHAEOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {153-169},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Within Central Asia there is an unusual group of earthen buildings
   (koshks), usually constructed on raised platforms, with vertical engaged
   columns forming iconic `corrugations' on the exterior walls. The
   complexes are semi-fortified, with a second storey entrance, and often
   with asymmetrical ranges of rooms around an internal courtyard. Little
   systematic archaeological work has taken place on these monuments, which
   have mainly been studied as relatively eroded standing structures.
   However, recent work at the Great Kyz Kala at Merv, Turkmenistan, the
   largest surviving monumental koshk in Central Asia, has provided more
   details of construction and use. The excavations suggest that this
   complex was constructed in the 8th/9th century CE, with well-appointed
   rooms on the second storey, including a large hall, and functional rooms
   and storage spaces around a courtyard on the lower floor. The complex
   was set within an enclosure, containing gardens and possibly ancillary
   buildings. This particular koshk may have acted as an elite palatial
   suburban residence, perhaps for the governor of Merv.},

Title = {Energy Security of Hydropower Producing Countries-The Cases of
   Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy security, as one of the most important components of state
   security, is a permanent element of academic debates and political
   discussions. Owing to the multidimensional and multifaceted nature of
   energy security, defining it is a complex process, requiring the
   consideration of a wide range of factors straddling economics, geology,
   ecology and geopolitics which decide whether we are dealing with the
   state of energy security or the lack of it. Energy security is usually
   equated with the security of supply. Another group of definitions of
   energy security focuses on the concept of security of services. A
   different approach to energy security issues is presented by energy
   exporting countries, whose objective is to ensure sufficiently high and
   stable income from sales of energy resource exports (security of
   demand). The subject of this paper is an analysis of the energy security
   of hydropower-producing countries-Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Energy
   security has been analyzed in the context of security of supply,
   services, and demand on the basis of the approach proposed by Llamosas
   and Sovacool. So far, no work has been carried out to analyse the
   hydropower sectors of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the context of the
   energy security comparison of both countries. It is worth emphasising
   that their energy security and mutual relations are important from the
   point of view of the stability of the entire Central Asian region.
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have large hydropower potential, which, if
   properly used, could cover their domestic electricity demand and the
   surplus can be exported to neighbouring countries. Unfortunately, both
   countries are not utilising this potential for the time being. The main
   difficulty in the area of security of supply and services is the
   seasonality and low reliability of electricity supplies. Among the
   reasons for this are the poor technical and economic conditions of
   energy companies as a result of maintaining low tariffs, the
   irrecoverability of consumers' energy bills, electricity theft,
   significant transmission loses and a high level of corruption. Although
   both countries aspire to the role of an energy exporters, they are
   themselves forced to import electricity from neighboring countries.},

Abstract = {Nine years of experience teaching economics in the Tajikistan and
   Kyrgyzstan provides knowledge on the nuances and challenges of teaching
   economics across cultures. Particular categories and difficulties are
   presented with some examples of how to address them. Conclusions and
   findings are used to form general guiding principles for teaching
   economics in the increasingly diverse US classroom. The principles
   offered in the paper are valuable to English speakers providing economic
   teaching and training in post-Soviet nations and, more broadly, to
   anyone teaching economics across cultures. Finally, suggestions based
   these principles are offered to encourage all professors of economics to
   carefully consider language, illustrations, diversity of views regarding
   economics and the multi-cultural nature of university classrooms to
   better relate to students and be more effective teachers.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {NP3346-NP3368},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Extant research has argued that there are variations in predictors of
   intimate partner violence (IPV) across nations and it is necessary to
   examine country-specific correlates of IPV. Much remains unknown about
   factors that affect risk of IPV in transitional countries. Specifically,
   we explore risk factors for IPV among four former nations of the Soviet
   Union-Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Moldova-with data from the
   nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys. Rates of
   physical abuse were similar within Tajikistan (18.96\%) and Moldova
   (18.38\%), while Kyrgyzstan (20.62\%) had the highest prevalence and
   Azerbaijan (9.29\%) had the lowest prevalence. In contrast, the
   prevalence of sexual abuse was very similar across the four countries
   and was much lower (between 1.00\% and 3.50\%) than cross-national
   estimates of physical abuse. Findings suggest that many of the same risk
   factors of IPV in developing and developed nations influence risk of IPV
   in transitional nations. Across the four former Soviet nations included
   in analyses, the experience of controlling behaviors, husband's alcohol
   use, and witnessing IPV or experiencing abuse during childhood were all
   significantly associated with risk of physical and sexual abuse later in
   life. Indeed, the intergenerational transmission of violence may be a
   cross-national phenomenon. In addition, equality in decision making did
   not have an effect on risk of physical and sexual violence, except for
   risk of physical abuse in Moldova. This may be due to the historical
   context of these nations. Taken together, findings suggest that country
   context may influence individual risk factors of IPV.},

Title = {`Two parts - one whole'? Kazakh-Kyrgyz relations in the making of Soviet
   Kyrgyzstan, 1917-24},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Abstract = {This article argues that the Kazakh-Kyrgyz relationship in many ways
   shaped the emergence of Soviet Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz elites were willing to
   collaborate with Kazakhs while simultaneously trying not to be
   marginalized by them. Kazakh elites in the Turkestan ASSR's government
   supported the first Kyrgyz nationalist project, the Kara-Kyrgyz Mountain
   Oblast (KKMO), in 1922. However, the division of Turkestan during the
   Central Asian national-territorial delimitation in 1924 and the
   increased linkage between national identity and political and cultural
   rights deprived the Kazakh-Kyrgyz regions of their socio-economic unity.
   Consequently, Kyrgyz leaders, to get their fair share of the
   disintegrating Central Asian economy as a separate group, had to
   contrast themselves to their Kazakh allies. The case of Soviet
   Kyrgyzstan shows that the intertwined relationship among Central Asian
   elites provides a more nuanced and complicated story of the formation of
   Soviet national republics in the region. Particularly, Central Asia's
   settled/nomadic dichotomy and the inter-elite relationship within each
   population have been more influential than scholars have acknowledged.},

Abstract = {Central Asian states are more complex than what a first glance at their

   statehood evolved in relation to both domestic dimensions (such as the
   traditional legacy of clans and the more recent Soviet experience) and
   powerful international influences, especially those of Western-driven
   neoliberalism, neighbouring Russia and China. While neoliberalism has
   had a significant impact on Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan has remained more
   anchored to the legacy of the Soviet Union. Yet both states have
   demonstrated autonomy in their economic choices and strong political
   agency; far from being pawns in the hands of Great Powers, they are
   active protagonists of twenty-first century global politics.},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Over the past century there have been a number of distinct attempts by
   geographers to generalize about the nature of international boundaries.
   The most influential contemporary movement is that which considers them
   as examples of more general processes of ``bordering{''} or
   ``bounding.{''} This approach is insightful but not without limitations,
   and can be advanced through writing what are termed ``boundary
   biographies{''} that explore how specific boundaries materialize,
   rematerialize, and dematerialize in different ways, in different
   contexts, at different scales, and at different times. A biography of
   the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan boundary traces its materialization as a
   result of the 1924 through 1927 process of national territorial
   delimitation and its multiple and varied re-and dematerializations
   throughout the Soviet and particularly the post-Soviet periods. This
   biography illustrates the importance of geography for understanding
   processes of nation-state formation and political contestation in
   Central Asia.},

Abstract = {If elections and civil liberties are the principal institutionalized
   mechanisms of democratic governance, and if naked coercion is the
   centerpiece of hard authoritarianism, what allows a soft authoritarian
   system to survive? The cement of soft authoritarian rule is the ability
   of elites to frame the political debate, thereby defining the political
   agenda and channeling political outcomes. The contrast between the
   strengthening of soft authoritarianism in Kazakhstan and the erosion of
   soft authoritarianism in Kyrgyzstan shows that soft authoritarianism is
   effective when it succeeds in making good use of the state's means of
   persuasion, although coercion remains a part of the ruling elite's
   arsenal. This perspective implies a need to conceptualize soft
   authoritarian rule in dynamic, rather than static, terms.},

   education programs and making suggestions about their practice. The data
   is collected using a questionnaire. The data is evaluated through
   content analysis and a qualitative research method. The findings show
   that the four countries share commonalities in terms of factors such as
   the contents of reports created in the course of education, passing
   requirements and performance evaluation while there are some differences
   in the semester and duration of practicums and in some of the
   responsibilities and tasks of the teacher trainees. The most frequently
   encountered problems cited by the practicum supervisors vary with the
   country. It is believed that the parties in the present study can
   benefit from the comparison of practices and their results and from

Abstract = {The eviction of the USA from the military base at Khanabad-Qarshi and
   the signing of an alliance treaty between Uzbekistan and Russia in
   November 2005 marked one of the most dramatic turnarounds in
   international alliances in the post-cold-war era. This article shows
   that regime survival is a driving force behind Uzbekistan's realignment.
   It also argues that a full account of Uzbekistan's turnaround needs to
   take into consideration systemic factors, namely, an external
   environment in which Russia provided a viable strategic and economic
   alternative. The article concludes by suggesting how the ``normative
   competition{''} in the region between Russia (and China) and the USA
   helps account for the timing of Uzbekistan's realignment.},

   A second-order factor analysis assured 1 underlying latent trait.
   Two-parameter logistic item response theory models were fit to responses

Journal = {BILIG},

Pages = {21-46},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Crimean Tatars have been experiencing the loss of homeland since the
   Russian invasion of Crimea in 1783, which caused massive waves of
   migration especially to the Ottoman Empire. The loss of homeland
   culminated in Stalin's strategic deportations. Crimean Tatars were
   deported from Crimea to Central Asia in 1944 and obtained the right to
   return to their homeland in 1989. Since then, the return process has
   continued. Considering that the construction of the myth of homeland is
   an effective instrument to mobilize national sentiment, this article
   studies the perception of homeland among Crimean Tatars with its
   different layers - as an essential marker of identity, as an idealized
   mythical final destination, as a land where the community lives, and
   finally as a rationally desired place in search for a better life. The
   article also argues that these layers may coexist in individual cases
   although their relative significance may vary.},

Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Number = {10, 10, SI},

Abstract = {The UN-Habitat Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM)
   benchmarking methodology was applied to profile the physical and
   governance features of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the
   former Soviet Union city of Bishkek, capital of the Kyrgyz Republic.
   Most of the ISWM indicators were in the expected range for a low-income
   city when compared with 20 reference cities. Approximately 240,000 t
   yr(-1) of MSW is generated in Bishkek (equivalent to 200 kg capita(-1)
   yr(-1)); collection coverage is over 80\% and 90\% of waste disposed
   goes to semi-controlled sites operating with minimal environmental
   standards. The waste composition was a distinctive feature, with
   relatively high paper content (20-27\% wt.) and intermediate organic
   content (30-40\% wt.). The study provides the first quantitative
   estimates of informal sector recycling, which is currently unrecognised
   by the city authorities. Approximately 18\% wt. of generated MSW is
   recycled, representing an estimated annual saving to the city
   authorities of US\$0.7-1.1 million in avoided collection/disposal costs.
   The waste management system is controlled by a centralised municipal
   waste enterprise (Tazalyk); therefore, institutional coherence is high
   relative to lower-middle and low-income cities. However, performance on
   other governance factors, such as inclusivity and financial
   sustainability, is variable. Future priorities in Bishkek include
   extending collection to unserved communities; improving landfill
   standards; increasing recycling rates through informal sector
   cooperation; improving data availability; and engaging all stakeholders
   in waste management strategy decisions. Extending the scope and
   flexibility of the ISWM protocol is recommended to better represent the
   variation in conditions that occur in waste management systems in
   practice.},

Abstract = {This study examines the ownership of English and linguistic (in)security
   of multilingual English learners in two post-Soviet nation-states. Using
   the chronotopic and scalar analysis of discourse, I examine students'
   ideologies of English vis-a-vis their linguistic repertoires in the
   context of national imaginary and globalization. I utilize the concept
   of `nation branding' to trace the relationship between language
   ideologies and broader sociopolitical factors, including neoliberalism.
   The analysis of 60 individual student interviews revealed that the
   state-circulated nation-branding discourse is a powerful tool for
   instilling the sense of linguistic ownership. The findings showed that
   students in Uzbekistan regard English as opportunistic and more valuable
   in the global market than their local languages. In contrast, students
   in Kazakhstan see all of their languages including English as pivotal in
   enacting trilingual identity at local, national, and global scales.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan introduced a single-district closed-list
   proportional electoral system in 2007. Despite similar rules, the
   relationship between MPs and their constituencies differs: while the
   reform fostered nationwide representation in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan's
   MPs maintained a local, personalised representation style. This article
   explores how similar electoral rules lead to divergent outcomes under
   diverse party systems. Based on legal documents and 25 original
   interviews, the article provides two in-depth accounts of how electoral
   rules interacted with institutional counterincentives to guide the
   representative behaviour of MPs. The analysis covers the effects on MPs'
   re-election strategies and the organisation of constituency service
   within factions.},

Title = {Institutional influences on SME exporters under divergent transition
   paths: Comparative insights from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper compares the influence of national institutional environments
   on the internationalisation of SME exporters from two countries,
   Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which followed divergent paths in the
   transition process. It contributes in several ways, notably by extending
   scholarly debate on divergent paths of transition to the IB literature,
   and enriching the institution-based view of IB with perspectives from
   the new institutional economics and comparative institutionalism and
   offering fresh evidence of how formal and informal institutions and the
   enforcement mechanism interact to create specific incentives and
   barriers for internationalising SMEs. The study, one of the first to
   examine SME exporters from the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia,
   cautions against the tendency to attribute countries in the transitional
   periphery with homogenous institutional environments. Analysis of case
   study evidence suggests appreciable differences in the institutional
   environments facing SME exporters in the comparator countries. More
   specifically, SME exporters in Tajikistan seem to experience tougher
   institutional constraints relative to their Kyrgyzstan counterparts, and
   this divergence in institutional environments appears to affect the
   internationalisation prospects and competitiveness of Tajikistan and
   Kyrgyzstan SME exporters adversely and favourably respectively. The
   above findings are richly illustrated in the paper, which also discusses
   implications for theory, managerial and policy decision making and
   future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article examines how a successful master frame in one location can
   promote mobilization failure in another by misleading movement
   entrepreneurs. It revisits two cases of low nationalist mobilization in
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to demonstrate that a fuller explanation
   should include the tactical choices - good and bad - of movement
   leaders. In both cases, a transnational anti-imperial master frame
   misled separatist nationalists, causing them to undervalue critical
   shifts in the political environments in their republics. In Uzbekistan,
   this frame left the Birlik nationalist movement open to division by the
   state in the aftermath of inter-ethnic violence, while it made
   Tajikistan's Rastokhez movement susceptible to eclipse by regionalist
   mobilization in Tajikistan.},

Abstract = {After the collapse oi Soviet Union the membercountries was accompanied
   by economic and political crises. Each country has chosen own monetary
   and fiscal policy considering the economic situation. Even though that
   their economic situation is similar, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are
   pursuing opposite fiscal policy. More precisely, Kyrgyzstan in recent
   years has changed its fiscal policy towards expansionary policy, when
   Tajikistan is continuing contractionary policy. This paper analyses the
   long and the short-run causality relationships between government
   expenditure and economic growth in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to reveal
   the results of such fiscal policies on real output, using Engle-Granger
   Cointegration and Granger Causality Tests.Results show that, over the
   2000:1-2013:4 period, there is a long run relationship between GDP and
   government expenditure in both countries. According to Granger Causality
   lest it was found an unidirectional causality from government
   expenditures to economic growth in Kyrgyzstan. But Granger causality
   test on economy of Tajikistan does not give any causality relations
   between these variables.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {353-372},
Abstract = {Soon after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, a civil war
   started in Tajikistan (1992-97). This was also the period when a number
   of international organizations arrived in the country to distribute
   humanitarian assistance and assist in conflict resolution and
   stabilization. After the UN, the Organization for Security and
   Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was the second key organization which
   appeared in the conflict-stricken country. Like other key international
   organizations in Tajikistan, the OSCE, which has been in the country
   since 1994, has seen a shift in its original functions of monitoring and
   emergency assistance. Some see its avowed objectives in the new century
   as formalistic, virtual and ineffective. By capturing perceptions of
   foreign assistance to Tajikistan among employees of the OSCE and other
   international organizations, NGO workers, government officials and
   ordinary citizens, this article explores how Tajikistan `socialized' the
   OSCE, making the organization simultaneously a benefactor, an industry
   and even an intruder.},

Abstract = {A century ago, Alfred Marshall demonstrated the inefficiency associated
   with farmers receiving only a portion of their marginal product. Farmers
   will supply less labor than under arrangements in which they receive
   their marginal product; output will be sub-optimal. Explanations of
   sharecropping are based on market imperfections, e.g., high transactions
   costs or inability to insure against risk, suggesting that sharecropping
   should disappear with economic development. Nevertheless, sharecropping
   survives. In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, sharecropping has no legal
   status but farm surveys provide evidence of its existence. Despite
   farmers' awareness of the Marshallian paradox, institutional uncertainty
   contributes to the persistent attractiveness of sharecropping.},

Abstract = {Drawing on comparisons with cooperative and competitive non-state health

   provision of health services in post-Soviet Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   It explores the conditions in which non-state provisions remain

   politicised in the Middle East. In contrast to Western conceptions of
   NGOs, Central Asia's health NGOs cooperate with state agencies to serve
   their constituencies. In contrast to the perceptions of Central Asian
   governments, health-oriented NGOs do not aim to politicise health care.
   Donor support to Central Asia's health NGOs has created civically
   oriented actors that fill gaps in the state's capacity and enable
   governments to better serve their populations.},

Abstract = {The transition economies of Eastern Europe, Central and East Asia face
   major challenges as they seek to compete within an increasingly
   globalised economy. For many of them, tourism is seen as providing one
   of the key areas of economic opportunity. This is certainly true of the
   three Asian countries considered in this paper Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and
   Uzbekistan. Within any economy seeking to operate competitively in the
   international tourism marketplace, the appropriate human resources,
   especially the skills, to deliver products and services of appropriate
   quality, are essential.
   This paper reports a labour market and skills study of the three Asian
   countries, based on two surveys of the accommodation and wider tourism
   sub-sectors. It identifies the key structural features of these tourism
   labour markets and addresses current and predicted skills shortages with
   respect to each of them. The paper draws conclusions with respect to the
   key issues facing tourism in the three countries, specifically in terms
   of their labour markets and skills requirements.},

Abstract = {Feed shortages hamper livestock rearing and thus impede the development
   of rural livelihoods in Central Asia. The production and in vitro
   quality of foliage from Ulmus pumila, Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus
   euphratica on degraded cropland were examined to determine the potential
   of these species to supplement diary cattle diets. Leaf dry matter (DM)
   production of the species, respectively, averaged 6, 8 and 17 t DM/ha, 4
   years after planting. Over seasons and years, crude protein
   concentrations (g/kg DM) ranged within 151-257 for E. angustifolia,
   70-241 for U. pumila and 92-187 for P. euphratica. The metabolizable
   energy concentrations (MJ/kg DM) were the highest in U. pumila and
   ranged within 9-10, followed by 7-10 of E. angustifolia and 7-9 of P.
   euphratica. The organic matter digestibility (\%) ranged within 58-70,
   54-66, and 51-66, respectively, for these species. These indicators
   combined denoted a medium-to-good feed quality of E. angustifolia and U.
   pumila leaves as a cheap protein supplement to roughages. The foliage of
   P. euphratica was the least suitable. The seasonal profile of in vitro
   indicators revealed the highest feed quality in spring but early fall
   seems most appropriate for forage collection given the peak leaf
   production and an adequate quality.},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan is home to the longest serving ruler in post-Soviet Eurasia
   while Kyrgyzstan is among the region's most competitive polities. Do
   these regime differences correspond to divergence in political
   attitudes, as an extensive body of literature posits? Are Kyrgyzstanis
   more likely to strongly support democratic ideals? Are Kazakhstanis less
   likely? Contrary to expectations, data reveal the two populations to be
   attitudinally indistinguishable when it comes to strong support for
   practices associated with democracy. Whatever country differences we
   find are minor or statistically insignificant. We explain this
   convergence by shifting focus away from the political features that
   distinguish the two nascent democracy versus consolidated
   authoritarianism to those that they hold in common. Notwithstanding
   major constitutional reform in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, politics there, as in
   Kazakhstan, remains fundamentally patronal, or patronage- based. Mass
   attitudes, we argue, align in many ways with the countries' shared
   patronal politics, rather than with their contrasting regime types.},

   varies across space. In particular, there are significant urban-rural
   distinctions that affect when Uzbek ethnicity is utilised to interpret
   the world. In addition, compared to others, rural Tajikistani Uzbeks
   perceive that the boundary between Uzbeks and the titular groups is

Abstract = {Using a qualitative horizontal comparative case study approach, this
   paper explores the experiences of female leaders in Central Asian
   academia to identify challenges they face in transition/performance, the
   sources of the challenges, and any differences in the experiences of the
   female leaders. The results of the study are consistent with prior
   studies conducted in other countries. One feature makes the experiences
   of women in the region distinctive. Unlike women in other contexts,
   women in Central Asia have to sort out several contradictory sets of
   gender expectations. The findings of this study also indicate that
   certain rules of operation of the informal power networks may create
   barriers to female advancement. Existing Western theories fail to
   explain the dynamics of informal exchange networks, which create
   barriers to female advancement. The contribution of this study is in
   bringing a new theoretical perspective to the analysis of female
   leadership in academia.},

Abstract = {This research examines the causality relationship between electricity
   (energy) consumption and economic growth for Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
   Kyrgyzstan. The data set used in the research covers the years
   1992-2015. Hacker and Hatemi-J (2006) for the non-asymmetric causality
   analysis and Hatemi-J (2012) for the asymmetric causality analysis were
   used as the research method. According to the results of the
   non-asymmetric causality analysis, while the Neutrality Hypothesis is
   supported for Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, the Conservation Hypothesis for
   Kyrgyzstan is supported. However, according to the results of asymmetric
   causality analysis, while the Neutrality Hypothesis is supported for
   Azerbaijan in both positive and negative shocks, this hypothesis is
   supported by negative shocks in Kazakhstan and Growth Hypothesis is
   supported in positive shocks. In Kyrgyzstan, the Conservation Hypothesis
   is supported in negative shocks and the Neutrality Hypothesis remains
   supported in positive shocks. According to this, energy conservation
   policies have no effect on Azerbaijan's economic growth. However, it is
   seen that electricity (energy) consumption increases economic growth in
   Kazakhstan and that economic growth will increase with the increase of
   electricity (energy) consumption in Kyrgyzstan. This shows that in the
   electricity (energy) consumption of these countries, more effective
   results can be obtained by taking into account the positive and negative
   shocks and the determination of energy policies in economic development
   processes.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a study aiming to find out which
   media platforms are used by online audiences in Central Asia and
   Kazakhstan to access news, how active Kazakhstani users are on the
   Internet, and what news content most interests them. The study is based
   on the results of a large-scale survey conducted by the Institute for
   War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in 2019 in four countries: Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. A total of 4,130 people were
   interviewed, including a number of media experts. An online research
   method was used, in which respondents were selected among Internet users
   in real time (river sampling). The study showed that, along with
   increased penetration of the Internet into Central Asian countries,
   online consumers of news content in Kazakhstan use social networks and
   messengers more often than those in other Central Asian countries. It
   was found that social networks in Central Asian countries tend to
   replace traditional media for users' consumption of operational news. At
   the same time, Kazakhstanis do not pay attention to the source of
   information, which can contribute to the influence of fake news and
   manipulations. It was revealed that online news about economy, culture,
   ecology and a number of other spheres of human activity remain
   uninteresting for Kazakhstani users.},

   CENTRAL ASIA)},
Booktitle = {AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION},
Series = {Agriculture Issues and Policies},

Abstract = {For the fulfillment of the thirsty ambition of self-sufficiency of the
   Soviets for cotton production, the arid Central Asian region,
   particularly, Uzbekistan has been extensively exploited. In fact, vast
   tracts of deserts have been converted into irrigated agricultural lands
   without proper consideration of the environment and technical standards.
   As a result, trends in natural resource degradation (soil salinity,
   desertification, water quality) as well as declining crop yields have
   dramatically increased.
   The agricultural sector is the backbone for employment, food security
   and export revenues of the Central Asian countries. Since the
   independence of the Central Asian countries (after the breakup of the
   former Soviet Union), the situation has changed dramatically in terms of
   institutional, political and technical systems. Political transition,
   which is defined as a shift from a once planned centralized economy to a
   market-driven one, has introduced `new' concepts like land tenure, water
   rights and different kinds of ownership. All such transformations have
   impacted the agricultural production in Central Asia.
   The institutional change can be described as decentralization of the
   farming systems, i.e. transition from the former state collective farms
   into the smaller forms of private farms. The institutional interventions
   are aimed to increase agricultural production through improving water
   management. It is arguable that private production systems are the most
   effective business-driven forces but the situation is quite different in
   Central Asia due to the irrigated agriculture.
   The biggest challenge for a sustainable irrigated agricultural
   production lies in the recent reforms of the water management sector in
   Central Asia and Uzbekistan. Water users' associations have been
   established to replace the former collective farming systems for
   irrigation water distribution and maintenance of irrigation
   infrastructures at the on-farm level. The intention of the national
   government was to shift the operation, maintenance and management of
   irrigation infrastructures to non governmental institutions
   (decentralization). However, these institutions have not fulfilled their
   promising tasks because of i) a rapid increase in the number of private
   farms along canals; ii) the cropping structure which is a mosaic with
   different crop water requirements compared to the former monoculture;
   iii) poor financial, training and technical capacities of the newly
   established institutions; iv) a state-ordered agricultural production
   quota system (for cotton and wheat).
   This paper analyzes the historical aspects of the transformation in the
   farming production institutions in Central Asia with a special focus on
   Uzbekistan and comprehensively overviews the main current challenges
   facing the farming system and potential opportunities for reversing the
   situation.},

Abstract = {Critical theories on the relationship of education and the state argue
   that school curricular materials are means to shape ``official{''}
   knowledge and ideology through education (Apple, 1993). The existing
   literature on the former Soviet education argued that the official
   curricular materials, including school textbooks, intended to instill
   the Soviet communist ideology as ``the official knowledge,{''} shaped a
   certain version of ``truth{''} in the minds of young students, and
   controlled alternative interpretations and positions. The emerging
   literature in post-Soviet education documents the changes in early
   literacy textbooks such as bukvar (Russian name for primers) and exposes
   the process of ``official knowledge{''} production. Such studies reveal
   how childhood, motherland, and citizenship are being reimagined in the
   process of nation-state building in Latvia, Ukraine, and Armenia (Mead
   \& Silova, 2013; Silova, 1996). The existing studies on the ideological
   changes of citizenship, childhood, nation-state, and education do not
   include gender as another significant unit of analysis to fully
   understand how contemporary nationalist ideologies of citizenship and
   childhood shape certain perspectives of gender and identity.
   Acknowledging the critical role of textbooks in the process of national
   and gendered identity construction and positioning, this study addresses
   the existing gap in the literature. This study examines this issue by
   analyzing early literacy textbooks in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. We
   employ feminist critical discourse analysis framework (Fairclough, 2013;
   Lazar 2007; Sunderland \& Litosseliti, 2002) to investigate the
   relationship between ideology, literacy, ethnicity, and gender in 2
   early literacy textbooks in each country Alippe in Kazakh and Kyrgyz and
   Bukvar' in Russian. The multilevel analysis of textbook content, visual
   representation, and language, and the comparison within and across these
   countries reveal that the official knowledge is not only nationalist but
   it further promotes gendered ethnicity and citizenship, often
   demonstrating contradictions with what young people observe in their
   daily interactions and experiences.},

Abstract = {The Central Asian countries are particularly affected by the global
   climate change. The cultural and economic centers in this mostly arid
   region have to rely solely on the water resources provided by the
   rapidly melting glaciers in the Pamir, Tien-Shan and Alay mountains. By
   2030, the available water resources will be 30 \% lower than today while
   the water demand will increase by 30 \%. The unsustainable land and
   water use leads to a water deficit and a deterioration of the water
   quality. Documenting the status quo of the water resources needs to be
   the first steps towards an integrated water resource management. The
   research presented here provides a detailed overview of the
   transboundary Zarafshan River, the lifeline for more than six million
   people. The findings are based on field measurements, existing data from
   the national hydrometeorological services and an extensive literature
   analysis and cover the status quo of the meteorological and hydrological
   characteristics of the Zarafshan as well as the most important water
   quality parameters (pH, conductivity, nitrate, phosphate, arsenic,
   chromate, copper, zinc, fluoride, petroleum products, phenols and the
   aquatic invertebrate fauna). The discharge of the Zarafshan is
   characterized by a high natural discharge dynamic in the mountainous
   upper parts of the catchment and by sizeable anthropogenic water
   extractions in the lower parts of the catchment, where on average 60.6
   \% of the available water is diverted for irrigation purposes in the
   Samarkand and Navoi provinces. The water quality is heavily affected by
   the unsustainable land use and inadequate/missing water purification
   techniques. The reduced discharge and the return flow of untreated
   agricultural drainage water lead to a critical pollution of the river in
   the lower parts of the catchment. Additional sources of pollutants were
   identified in the Navoi special economic area and the mining industry in
   the Tajik part of the catchment. The impact of the global climate change
   and the socio-economic growth on the water availability and the water
   demand will aggravate the detected problems and might lead to severe
   local and transboundary upstream-downstream water conflicts within the
   next decades.},

Abstract = {It is important that university websites and services offered through
   their sites are used effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily by the
   whole target group of the university, including disabled users. However,
   universities in many countries are still unable to meet the criteria for

   universities in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkey using
   automated assessment tools. The results showed that university websites
   are more popular in Turkey, and in Turkish universities developers pay
   more attention to the performance of websites, followed by websites of
   Azerbaijani, Kyrgyz and Kazakh universities. The majority of the
   university websites in the study did not meet the WCAG 2.0 accessibility
   criteria. Only two Kyrgyz and two Kazakh university websites attained
   conformance level A, and only three, one Kyrgyz and two Kazakh, achieved
   accessibility conformance level AAA. Based on the results, it was
   determined that universities included in the present study need to
   devote more effort to making their websites more accessible for their

Abstract = {The article contributes to the development of a deeper understanding of
   the changes in the practice of venerating and visiting of the graves of
   saints in Central Asia during the Soviet period. For this purpose, the
   article explores the archival reports and oral histories from the region
   of the southern Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan from the 1920s to the
   1980s. The article reveals that the broad ``categories{''} often used to
   study the issues associated with the graves of saints and their
   visitation, such as the ideological conflict between communist politics
   and Islam, or the gap between normative and popular Islam, are largely
   insufficient when describing the practice during this period. The common
   ``schemes{''} are blurred or interconnected - ``believers{''} used the
   Soviet system to fulfil their goal of venerating the graves of saints,
   while the local authorities often helped to retain the practice, or
   eliminate it, as determined by the needs of their own career
   advancement. In addition, the process of hagiography continued under the
   new conditions, irrespective of the levels of education or the
   individual stances towards the state that existed among the different
   actors. For the most part, people learned how to combine both Soviet
   modernity and the veneration of the graves of saints in innovative ways.
   This analysis contributes to the innovative research process in relation
   to Islam in Soviet Central Asia. The article also seeks to contribute to
   the recent debate about the graves of saints and the gap between
   normative and popular Islam.},

Abstract = {In the high mountain valleys of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, gravity-flow
   irrigation systems support the production of grains, fodder, vegetables,
   herbs, and fruits as well as wood for fuel and construction purposes. In
   the Soviet and post-Soviet periods, major changes in the organization of
   society and agriculture have occurred which, when combined with the
   effects of population growth and outmigration in recent decades, have
   fundamentally altered the normative and organizational arrangements that
   had sustained hill irrigation in the past. This article presents 2 case
   studies, one from the Alaikuu area of Tar Valley, Osh Province, Alai
   mountain range, southern Kyrgyzstan, and the other from the upper
   Shokhdara Valley in Gorno-Badakhshan, Pamir mountain range, eastern
   Tajikistan. A combination of rights and obligations form the foundation
   of self-managed offtake systems, the rules for which reflect existing
   social relationships. The importance of authority to the effective
   management of these systems is highlighted. Multiple forms of authority
   coexist at the local level in the Alai and Pamir ranges because of the
   recent introduction of formal local government and water governance
   reforms in both countries and the persistence of informal local
   political institutions, such as the court of elders in Alaikuu and the
   village headman in Shokhdara. Population growth and diversified
   livelihood strategies, especially migration, have encouraged a degree of
   individualism-an attitude that undermines the recognition of authority
   required for the collective management of hill irrigation systems. An
   understanding of the heterogeneous role of authority in irrigation
   management that does not privilege externally created formal
   institutions is required for government and nongovernment agencies to
   support hill irrigation and mountain agriculture.},

   Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have high-value natural resources and
   significant FDI, making them most likely cases for reform. Kyrgyzstan is
   a contrasting case as it has few natural resources. We find that the
   institutional reforms we would anticipate because of linkages have not

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Reorganization of Cropland Development in Central Asia
   during the Post-Soviet Era: A Sustainable Implication in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The abandonment and cultivation of croplands in the Eurasian Steppe has
   become the focus of global and regional food security and agricultural
   policy-making. A large area of cropland in some post-Soviet countries
   has proven to be abandoned with the disintegration of the Soviet Union;
   however, it is unclear as to whether Kazakhstan also experienced a
   similar change as one of the main food providers for the former Soviet
   Union. In this study, we used the annual land cover dataset (1992-2015)
   from the European Space Agency, Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) to
   detect spatio-temporal characteristics of rainfed and irrigated cropland
   changes in Kazakhstan. The Mann-Kendall test and regime shift analysis
   showed that rainfed and irrigated cropland at national level had a
   significant increasing trend with a significant rising up to 1999 and
   stagnation during 2000-2015, which was further confirmed with analysis
   at 14 regions. The greatest contributor to rainfed and irrigated
   croplands was steppes, followed by shrinkage of water bodies since 2005
   to a great extent, rapid urbanization process resulted in losses of a
   part of irrigated oases. The trend surface analysis indicated that
   reorganized stable pattern characterized by rainfed cropland in north
   and irrigated cropland in south was driven by the strategy of the
   gradual agricultural development of oases. The nonexistence of cycle
   between the abandonment and recultivation proved that newly-gained
   cropland from steppe may be less degraded and more productive for
   sustainable land use in Kazakhstan. In conclusion, this study can
   provide strong evidence for sustainable land use and a basis for food
   security policy-making in Kazakhstan, and even all of the Central Asian
   countries in the future.},

Abstract = {The goal of the research is comparative analysis of approaches to
   designing and adoption of the regulatory impact assessment institute in
   the post-Soviet countries - Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan,
   revealing the problems and prospects of this institute development in
   the countries of analyzed summation.
   The research was conducted using general scientific and specialized
   methods. General scientific methods of comparative and
   evolutionary-genetic researches were applied to conduct cross-national
   comparisons of processes on implanting of new national institutes in
   historical retrospective. The specialized methods of the institutional
   and constitutional theory allowed analyzing mutual influence of
   legislative and economic factors for making national decisions in the
   field of economy regulation within the established national systems of
   the state administration.
   By the research results, the conclusions reflecting the specifics of the
   regulatory impact assessment institute designing in Russia, Kazakhstan,
   and Kyrgyzstan were made in view of selection of key actors and
   distribution of powers among them. The high role assigned in Kazakhstan,
   during the assessment institute designing, to structures expressing the
   interests of the entrepreneurs is noted. The level of the assessment
   institute maturity in the analyzed countries is characterized.},

Abstract = {Contrary to optimistic assessments on the stabilising impact of the US
   troop deployment in Central Asia, the long-term prospects for regional
   stability are far from certain. The American entry into Central Asia has
   complicated the geostrategic dynamics of the region and engaged the
   three great powers and regional players in intense rivalry for influence
   and leverage. If there was ever a `Great Game' at play in the
   post-Soviet era, it is now. The convergence of the great powers on
   Central Asia was justified in terms of anti-terrorism. The toppling of
   the Taliban in Afghanistan may have secured its northern neighbours from
   an imminent threat, but the direct involvement of US forces in Central
   Asia is not likely to contribute to regional stability in the long run.},

Abstract = {A detailed characterization of municipal solid waste (MSW) beyond a
   standard compositional analysis may offer insights useful for improving
   waste management systems. The present paper contributes to the scarce
   literature in the field by presenting new data from a rapidly developing
   Central Asian city, the capital of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan. Three
   sampling campaigns (each 1 week long) have been conducted at the city
   landfill over a 1-year period (2018-2019), and a detailed
   characterization for selected waste components and sub-components has
   been performed. The major fractions of MSW were organics (46.3\%),
   plastics (15.2\%), paper (12.8\%), and diapers (5.9\%). The detailed
   composition analysis showed high LDPE (low-density polyethylene) content
   (5.5\%) mostly comprised of plastic bags (4.5\%), transparent glass
   (3.2\%), pharmaceuticals (0.4\%), and fine (i.e., < 12 mm) organic
   fraction content (29\%). The MSW generation rate of Nur-Sultan was
   estimated as 1.47 kg capita(-1) day(-1) based on the field collection as
   well as literature data. Among sustainable waste management
   recommendations addressed for Nur-Sultan and applicable to other cities
   in Central Asia, composting is recommended due to high organics fraction
   in MSW and its great potential to reduce the landfilled waste volume and
   to help valorizing the waste.},

Title = {An examination of early grade reading assessments in Central Asia: using
   factor analysis to determine the latent data structure in Kyrgyz,
   Russian, and Tajik},
Journal = {READING AND WRITING},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {The early grade reading assessment (EGRA) is frequently used in low and
   middle-income countries to inform the state of reading outcomes and
   reading instruction (Dubeck \& Gove, 2015). Although the EGRA has been
   administered in languages with varying orthographies and scripts, there
   is little research on the cross-linguistic comparability of the
   psychometric properties of its subskills in a wide range of languages
   and diverse writing systems. In this study, Grade 2 and 4 assessment
   results in the Kyrgyz, Russian, and Tajik languages from the Kyrgyz
   Republic (4751 pupils) and Tajikistan (4328 pupils) were analyzed to
   determine the number and nature of the underlying EGRA constructs. These
   three languages represent very different languages families but all
   three use the Cyrillic or modified Cyrillic script. Principal axis
   factor analysis was employed on nationally representative samples to
   factor analyze reading results on nine reading subtasks for Grade 2 and
   seven reading subtasks for Grade 4. The results for all three languages
   indicate that the data structure confirms two common underlying reading
   constructs: decoding and language comprehension. By focusing our
   investigation on Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, we go beyond the
   ``anglocentricities{''} (Share, 2008) and monolingualism inherent in the
   theoretical base that informs the development of many EGRAs. This is
   important not only for programmatic decision making and impact
   evaluation outcome measure identification, but also for the development
   and definition of literacy metrics that may be used in the measurement
   of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) and other international
   development benchmarks.},

Abstract = {A significant body of Muslim religious rites, with roots in Sufi
   devotional practice, continued to be conducted in Central Asia well into
   the Soviet era, despite Soviet antireligious policies and pressures.
   Reflecting communal adaptations of the Sufi dhikr, or ``remembrance{''}
   of God, as part of healing or funerary ceremonies, these rites were
   reclassified, in Soviet ethnographic literature, as vestiges of
   ``shamanism,{''} and thus largely escaped notice by western observers of
   ``Soviet Islam,{''} who imagined `Sufism' in terms of clandestine
   militant organizations intent on undermining the Soviet regime. This
   paper explores the reclassification of Sufi activity as shamanism, notes
   historical evidence on the diffusion of Sufi rites into wider public
   circles, and suggests some implications of these developments for our
   understanding of Soviet Islam, Central Asian Sufism, and the phenomena
   of ``shamanism.{''}},

Abstract = {Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are two leading countries of Central Asia,
   mutually beneficially cooperating in the field of cross-border tourism.
   In this study, the tourism potential of the border areas was determined
   on the basis of tourism infrastructure and settlement density data. The
   geographic coverage of the study included nine regions located within
   the limits of the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan border. We proposed the
   application of a rating assessment of the estimated tourism resource
   potential of Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan border regions, which provides the
   basis for comparative analysis of tourism development and promising
   opportunities for the large territory. The method allows one to achieve
   an understanding of the availability and volume of tourist and
   recreational resources in order to assess the tourism potential in the
   Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan border area in the framework of sustainable
   development. The study results generally allow the availability level of
   border region tourism resources to be determined and areas with more
   favorable and attractive conditions for cross-border tourism development
   to be identified.},

Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {503+},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A combination of revolutionary ideology, trouble with neighbours and
   location in the Middle East, where regionalism is moribund, make the
   Islamic Republic of Iran an unlikely enthusiast for regional
   coalition-building. The impetus towards regionalism derives first and
   foremost from geopolitical considerations-the need to counter the US
   government's efforts to isolate Iran-but also from domestic dynamics;
   the regionalist discourse has lent an acceptable ideological colouring
   to an increasingly pragmatic foreign policy.
   Iran's neighbours, however, share neither its geopolitical predicament
   nor its ideological complexion, and the actual implementation of
   Tehran's regionalist agenda has been based on functional cooperation,
   rather than on geopolitics and ideology. Trade promotion and the
   development of transport infrastructure to link Central Asia and the
   Caspian to Turkey and the Persian Gulf have been the most appealing
   areas for northern neighbours, and dominate the agenda of the Economic
   Cooperation Organization, Iran's main vehicle for multilateral
   cooperaton with Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Tehran's 1992 proposal for
   a Caspian Sea Cooperation Organization has so far been stymied by the
   littoral states' well-publicized disagreements over the sea's legal
   status, though their numerous multilateral meetings and handful of
   agreements suggest that the idea has potential in the medium-term.
   Notwithstanding the meagre tangible results to date, Iran's tilt towards
   regionalism has had a positive impact. It has helped to rehabilitate the
   Islamic Republic in the eyes of its neighbours, contributed to the
   evolution of policy debate at home and prepared the ground for future
   multilateral cooperation.},

Abstract = {Central Asia is the `best customer' of the OSCE. It is the area of five
   post-Soviet OSCE participating states that are in significant need of
   support by the organization that prides itself on cooperative security
   and that have many shortcomings primarily in the humanitarian dimension,
   which the organization should foster to change. Central Asia has
   demonstrated less political and socio-economic transformation since its
   independence than it could have. While it receives reduced interest due
   to the declining importance of those two matters that contributed to it
   (rich natural resources and energy bearers and the vicinity of
   Afghanistan), the OSCE is the organization where Central Asia is `at
   home'. Central Asian states would like to face less soft persuasion (and
   even less hard pressure), but they would like to benefit from the
   assistance of the organization and its participating states. It is for
   this reason that there is more than one OSCE in Central Asia trying to
   meet the different needs of the area.},

Abstract = {In the post-Soviet 1990s, the three key players in the geopolitical
   space around Central Asia - Russia, China and the United States -
   achieved a provisional equilibrium. Russia maintained its traditional
   dominance in its former southern provinces. China, as it developed its
   economic relations with the Central Asian countries, gradually increased
   its own political influence, while seeking to avoid confrontation with
   Moscow. The United States, despite its preoccupation with other areas of
   greater strategic significance, kept a wary eye on the region. After 11
   September, this alignment of power has changed: the United States is now
   the region's main economic donor and security manager. The Bush
   administration needs to think clearly about the advantages and
   disadvantages of US dominance in Central Asia. The American presence in
   Central Asia threatens to offend Russian nationalistic sensibilities and
   make Putin's pro-US policy domestically very difficult. The optimal US
   approach to Central Asia is to establish leadership there in partnership
   with Russia. It is not in the American interest to corner Putin and deny
   him the opportunity to continue his policy of integrating Russia with
   the West.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the politico-military cooperation among the
   Central Asian countries viewed as a key factor in ensuring the regional
   security. Today, the geopolitical tension in the surrounding regions,
   the worsening situation in Afghanistan, as well as intraregional
   socio-economic problems directly affect the security situation in
   Central Asia. In this regard, the question arises as to how well the
   Central Asian states are able to meet these challenges. The analysis of
   the situation in the region in the 1990s and at the beginning of the new
   century shows that attempts have been made to establish a regional
   security system based on military cooperation among Kazakhstan,
   Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, unregulated interstate
   relations in Central Asia, the lack of political will to cooperate with
   leaders of neighboring countries and the combination of external and
   internal threats have contributed to the creation of a regional security
   system based on the multilateral structures with the involvement of
   external actors. (C) 2018 The Regents of the University of California.

   its homogeneity: each state in the region is developing in its own way,
   according to its own model and has only its own international

Abstract = {Eurasianism as a concept emerged among Russian emigres in the 1920s,
   with the premise that Russia is a unique ethnic blend, primarily of
   Slavic and Turkic peoples. Its geopolitical implications for Russia
   include gravitation toward mostly Turkic Central Asia. Alexander Dugin,
   one of its best-known proponents, believes that the demise of the Soviet
   Union was simply a tragic incident. The people of the former USSR should
   again be united in a grand Eurasian empire, with Russia a benign and
   generous patron, providing its ``younger brothers{''} clients economic
   largesse and defense, mostly against the predatory USA. The ``orange
   revolutions{''} and the rise of Russian nationalism, for whose
   proponents a restored imperial presence is rather marginal, indicate
   that Eurasianism-along with the dream of the resurrection of the USSR-is
   becoming less viable. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {The Circle of Hydro-Hegemony between riparian states, development
   policies and borderlands: Evidence from the Talas waterscape
   (Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {112-121},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since the 1990s, transboundary water management has come to play a key
   role both in global environmental politics debates and in the shaping of
   international development policies, specifically in the Global South. As
   a consequence, a growing body of literature in the framework of critical
   hydropolitics has emerged reflecting on the role that power, discourses,
   and strategies play in shaping transboundary water policies and in
   influencing riparian relations. The focus on a state-centric
   perspective, however, often has led to neglect of the role of
   international development actors in shaping these policies. Through a
   critical application of the Circle of Hydro Hegemony (CHH) and
   ethnographic qualitative field research in borderlands, this
   contribution aims to analyse how the establishment of a development
   initiative known as the Chu-Talas Commission, supported by the United
   Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and other donors, has
   influenced and shaped transboundary water politics in the Talas
   waterscape, which is shared by Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The evidence
   shows that despite the international narration of the Chu-Talas
   Commission as a success story for water cooperation in Central Asia,
   Kazakhstan, through the deployment of both material and bargaining power
   strategies, has been able to shape UNECE development policies in its
   favour, impose its agenda on Kyrgyzstan, and emerge as the basin
   hydro-hegemon.},

   and Uzbekistan},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this contemporary era, environmental problems spread at different
   levels in all countries of the world. Economic growth does not just
   depend on prioritizing the environment or improving the environmental
   situation. If the foreign direct investment is directed to the polluting
   industries, they will increase pollution and damage the environment. The
   purpose of the study is to consider the relationship between foreign
   direct investment in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and economic growth and
   renewable energy consumption. The study is based on data obtained from
   1992 to 2018. The results show that there is a two-way link between
   foreign direct investment and renewable energy consumption in the
   considered two countries. The Granger causality test approach is applied
   to explore the causal relationship between the variables. The Johansen
   co-integration test approach is also employed to test for a
   relationship. The empirical results verify the existence of
   co-integration between the series. The main factors influencing
   renewable energy are economic growth and electricity consumption. To
   reduce dependence on fuel-based energy sources, Kazakhstan and
   Uzbekistan need to attract energy to renewable energy sources and
   implement energy efficiency based on rapid progress. This is because
   renewable energy sources play the role of an engine that stimulates the
   production process in the economy for all countries.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {373-390},
Abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the post-communist states of Central Asia, as
   `participating States' of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
   in Europe, have been regularly persuaded by the organization to invite
   its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to monitor their
   national parliamentary and presidential elections. The OSCE/ODIHR's
   objectives have been to assist the Central Asian participating states in
   holding free and fair elections and aid in a presumed ongoing
   post-communist democratization process. We argue that contrary to OSCE's
   assumptions, repeated OSCE/ODIHR election observations of Central Asian
   states with histories of fraudulent elections (as demonstrated by the
   case study of Tajikistan during 2000-2013) have not contributed to the
   flourishing of democracy and political pluralism, but rather
   inadvertently aided in the solidification of authoritarianism and
   `virtual democracy' - a phenomenon we refer to as `Helsinki's
   counterintuitive effect'. Using stakeholder interviews, we test four
   hypotheses in support of this general proposition.},

Abstract = {Although Kyrgyzstan has recently withstood two coup d'etats (or
   so-called ``revolutions{''}) and a bout of ethnic violence, the
   politicization of the legal system by successive presidents portends a
   troublesome future. The 2017 transition from Almazbek Atambaev to
   Sooronbai Jeenbekov gave way to the former's arrest and imprisonment. A
   series of other prior arrests and incarcerations of (former)
   parliamentarians indicate that Kyrgyzstan's presidents are regularly
   manipulating the legal system to persecute and neutralize their rivals.
   This article posits that the repetitive rupturing of legal institutions
   will usher in an era of heightened illiberalism, elite uncertainty, and
   the further discrediting of the political system, thereby placing the
   state on the brink of failure. The mass uprising in response to the
   October 2020 parliamentary electoral results and most recent coup d'etat
   indicate that the prospects of the Kyrgyz Republic suffering a collapse
   are real.},

   were carried out utilizing online automated tools. Results indicate that
   the usage rate of Information and Communication Technologies by the

   government Web sites but not their quality in use. Very few ministry Web
   sites of the four countries achieved AA conformance level on
   accessibility, many failed to pass conformance level A and AA
   checkpoints for accessibility errors. In order to ensure equal access to
   all their citizens, the countries in this study need to put more

Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, China's and Russia's strategic outlooks have
   gradually been converging. The two great powers have incrementally shed
   their mutual apprehensions and started a comprehensive and multifaceted
   cooperation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
   Simultaneously, as the rift between the US and Russia has opened up and
   the differences in their views on regional security in Eurasia have
   become even more evident, China's and Russia's quests for new models for
   regional security in Central Asia have gained ground. Enveloping the
   Central Asian states on issues of collective and energy security, both
   states are sternly against US dominance in international affairs. In
   this sense, they have initiated a new geopolitical script around Central
   Asia. As their mutual interests hold sway over US influence regionally,
   questions remain on whether specific interests are compatible, or
   harbour new rivalries. Chinese-Russian interaction in Central Asia
   reveals that there might be limits to the future expansion of their
   partnership.},

Abstract = {The scenario is by now familiar: repressive authoritarian regimes
   propped up by us military might and economic aid; widespread
   unemployment and poverty spawned by severe economic crises and a lack of
   economic freedom; popular resentment against American foreign policy and
   us troops in the region escalating as domestic support for militant
   Islamists increases.
   The Middle East today? No, it is Central Asia in the near future. How
   this future will arrive can be traced in part to misguided policies
   pursued by the United States toward the region since its independence
   from Soviet rule. New strategic partnerships established in the
   aftermath of 9-11 have only exacerbated the situation. Fortunately, it
   is not too late to turn back the clock and prevent Central Asia from
   becoming the next Middle East.},

Abstract = {Central Asia is a region where both China and Japan would like to pursue
   greater roles and interests. Largely initiated by China, the Shanghai
   Cooperation Organisation has enhanced China's influence in Central Asia.
   This has caused concern for Japan, which then sought to expand its
   presence in the region. Through meetings and dialogues with Central
   Asian leaders, and by providing aid and loans to states in the region,
   leaders of China and Japan have been trying to obtain contracts for
   extracting oil, natural gas, rare metals, uranium and other minerals
   from Central Asian states, and secure peace in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the Soviet Central Asia from a historical
   perspective to understand the impact of the Soviet regime on Muslim
   women's lifestyles. It specifically focuses on the underlying reasons of
   laws and policies put into effect by the Soviet officials in the name of
   emancipating Muslim women in Central Asia. The main argument of the
   study is that even though the Soviet officials had a genuine intention
   for the emancipation of Central Asian women from the patriarchal
   structure both in the public and private spheres of life, the policies
   and their implementations were shaped in accordance with the basic
   motive of the regime to survive. In the first years of the Soviet
   regime, mostly ideological intentions shaped the women's emancipation
   project.},

   evidence from South Korean FDI in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan},
Journal = {REGIONAL STATISTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Considering the growing significance of Eurasian economic ties because
   of South Korea's New Northern Policy and Russia's New Eastern Policy,
   this study investigates the motivations and locational factors of South
   Korean foreign direct investment (FDI) in three countries in the
   Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS: Kazakhstan, Russia, and
   Uzbekistan) by employing panel analysis (pooled ordinary least squares
   {[}OLS], fixed effects, random effects) using data from 1993 to 2017.
   The results show the positive and significant coefficients of GDP,
   resource endowments, and inflation. Unlike conventional South Korean
   outward FDI, labour-seeking is not defined as a primary purpose.
   Exchange rates, political rights, and civil liberties are identified as
   insignificant. The authors conclude that South Korean FDI in Kazakhstan,
   Russia, and Uzbekistan is associated with market-seeking (particularly
   in Kazakhstan and Russia) and natural resource-seeking, especially the
   former. From a policy perspective, our empirical evidence suggests that
   these countries' host governments could implement mechanisms to
   facilitate the movement of goods across regions and countries to
   increase the attractiveness of small local markets. The South Korean
   government could develop financial support and risk sharing programmes
   to enhance natural resource-seeking investments and mutual exchange
   programmes to overcome the `red syndrome' complex in South Korean
   society.},

   face what they believe to be a mounting terrorist threat. This article
   examines the already visible military and strategic rivalry between

Abstract = {After a swift decline during the 1990s following the collapse of the
   Soviet Union, period fertility rates have either been stagnating or
   increasing in all countries of Central Asia. In this paper, I
   investigate the role of data artifacts, population composition effect,
   economic context and shifting tempo effect in explaining fertility
   changes in Central Asia. The analysis is primarily based on comparison
   of fertility data from the vital registration system with estimates from
   other data sources. The results show that the recent changes to be real
   and not a result of data artifact. The most plausible explanations are
   to be found in the three other non-exclusive factors (population
   composition effect, economic context and shifting tempo effect) that
   contributed jointly and simultaneously to push up the period fertility
   rates in the region.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-104},
Abstract = {This article discusses the current process of securitisation in Central
   Asia and identifies its convoluted and faulty nature as a factor
   impeding collective security action in the region. It uses the Regional
   Security Complex Theory (RSCT) as an explanatory tool and posits that
   security discourse in and about the five former Soviet republics is
   dominated by geopolitical grand strategy on the one hand and by
   particularist concerns about lack of democracy or transnational threats
   on the other. Issues of conventional security involving two or more
   states, such as territorial disputes or resource management, are pushed
   aside and rarely securitised at the official level. The article outlines
   conceptual and institutional reasons for this bias, and argues that
   unless inter-state tensions are properly analysed, debated and
   addressed, the prospects for security and stability in the region will
   remain grim.},

Abstract = {Central Asia, with its abundance of natural resources and low labor
   costs, is often seen as an attractive destination for foreign
   investment. The inflow of foreign investment into Central Asia has
   significantly increased in recent decades, and this phenomenon supports
   the improvement of both national economies and the welfare of the
   region. Still, Central Asia is not classified as a low-risk destination
   for foreign investment because of inadequate protection of foreign
   investment-particularly a lack of transparency and predictability in
   Central Asia states' FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) regimes.
   Furthermore, international organizations (such as the OECD) indicate
   that some countries in Central Asia do not have clear investment
   policies. These points pose problems for foreign investors who desire to
   invest in the region. From this perspective, this article analyzes the
   consistency of the general principles of foreign investment in Central
   Asia with international investment standards.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ongoing natural gas revolution and assesses
   its impact on the energy industry and societies of Central Asia,
   conceived as the five ``Stans{''}: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
   Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The natural gas revolution consists of
   three related technological developments-hydraulic fracturing,
   horizontal drilling, and the increasing build-out of the world liquid
   natural gas (LNG) infrastructure.
   The article focuses on Turkmenistan and its rich reserves of natural gas
   and explores the conditions under which Turkmen gas currently reaches
   international markets through pipelines to China, Iran, and Russia. It
   also assesses Turkmenistan's future prospects for reaching additional
   world markets and for sustaining the markets it presently serves.
   Finally, the article analyzes the difficulties that Turkmenistan's gas
   industry, and other Central Asia energy industries, are likely to face.},

   substantial. To continue the campaign against terrorism, the United
   States retained the Central Asian bases it acquired to destroy the

   deepen American involvement-as a safeguard against militant Islam and
   Russian hegemony. Russia is understandably anxious about the deployment
   of American troops on its southern periphery. Newly ensconced in a

Title = {Geopolitics of water securitisation in Central Asia},
Journal = {GEOJOURNAL},
Abstract = {Over the years ensuring water securitisation in Central Asia is assuming
   geopolitical dimensions. Historical experiences, the rapid
   industrialisation and diversification of agricultural practices along
   with the pattern of water distribution in the Central Asian space rooted
   in historical trajectories to a greater extent are some of the factors
   contributing to the dynamics of water insecurity in Central Asia. It
   needs to be underlined here that though Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan
   constitute the upstream countries but their dependence on gas from
   Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to a greater extent limits the
   ``hydro-hegemony{''} model. However, the same model can be applied in
   the context of China-Kazakhstan water dispute over sharing the river
   Ili. At the same time, what one witnessed over some time is the
   proliferation of identity-based primordial conflict largely accentuated
   due to sharing of scarce water resources. This is aptly visible in the
   Ferghana region of Central Asia where three Central Asian
   countries-Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan-share a common border along
   with water bodies also. The existence of the contested geopolitical
   space, climate change, competition over scarce resources like water and
   its impact on human security are some of the factors responsible for
   aggravating the insecurity of Central Asia. In this regard, the existing
   regional mechanisms also need to be strengthened which to a substantial
   extent address the issue of the water crisis in a more holistic manner.},

Abstract = {In this paper I present an analysis of a mobile entrepreneur and his
   transnational economic activities in post-Soviet space. I argue that the
   space of informal economic activities of mobile entrepreneurs are
   structured by trust-networks in the sense Tilly (2005) uses it. In this
   context the concept of tirikchilik (an Uzbek term for `muddling through'
   or survival) which defines the space of informal economic activities is
   important to decipher. Tirikchilik unifies various economic activities
   which vary from trade, service delivery, middleman services,
   administration and any kind of activity that generates some cash. (C)

Journal = {ASIAN POPULATION STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-77},
Abstract = {Limited studies document the fertility changes in Central Asia. Using
   survey and official data, this study describes the fertility changes
   since 1980 in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. I first
   consider the swift decline in fertility in the 1980s and 1990s through
   the analysis of Synthetic Parity Progression Ratios (SPPRs). SPPRs show
   that women still have at least one child despite economic difficulties
   and that the end of communism affected more the transition to
   higher-order births. These results are however influenced by economic
   and demographic factors specific to each country. I investigate then the
   fertility upturn that is observed since the early 2000s-an issue
   neglected so far by demographers. Results from the analysis of official
   and household data show that in each country, the recent fertility
   increase resulted from the increase of distinct birth orders and was
   concentrated in specific ethnic groups.},

Abstract = {The Silk Road has a twenty-five century long history as a network of

   investigate whether there are significant differences between pre- and
   post-travel images of Central Asia and whether the incongruence between
   pre- and post-travel image constructs influences tourists' satisfaction
   with the trip and their behavioural intentions. The pre- and post-travel
   surveys were administered to first-time Korean visitors to Central Asia.
   Factor analyses were conducted on pre- and post-travel image and
   benefits differences. Regression analyses examined relationships among
   image and benefits incongruence, trip satisfaction and behavioural
   intentions. Some pre- and post-travel affective and cognitive images of
   Central Asia were significantly different, whereas all benefits were
   perceived more positively after the trip. Also, tourists who reported
   positive changes in affective and cognitive images were more satisfied
   with the trip and their satisfaction influenced their intentions to
   revisit the region.},

Abstract = {Will revolution, either of the democratic or the Islamic fundamentalist
   variety, spread throughout Central Asia? Such a question cannot be

   going on in Central Asia in light of different theories of revolution,
   including the ones focusing on relative deprivation, regime type, state
   breakdown, external factors, democratic revolution theory, and the role
   of the military. This study will show that several theoretical
   approaches suggest that the ingredients for revolution in Central Asia
   are either there now or will be in the not too distant future. (C) 2007

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article reviews the development of smallholder farming in Central
   Asia's former Soviet republics. One of the striking features of the
   agricultural transition in Central Asia (and Commonwealth of Independent
   States {[}CIS] in general) is the dramatic shift, since 1992, from the
   predominance of large corporate farms to individual or family
   agriculture based on a spectrum of small farms. Evidence shows that
   individualization of agriculture is associated with the observed
   posttransition recovery in Central Asia (and in CIS in general) and that
   small family farms outperform the large enterprises. This clashes with
   the traditional philosophy of economies of scale and with the inherited
   view of small family farms as an undesirable aberration. We discuss the
   policies that helped smallholder farms in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
   Tajikistan and severely restricted their growth and development in
   Uzbekistan and especially Turkmenistan.},

Abstract = {Although trust is a lively area of research, it is rarely investigated
   in countries outside of commonly available cross-national public-opinion
   datasets. In an effort to fill this empirical void and to draw
   conclusions concerning the general determinants of trust, the current
   article employs detailed survey data from a frequently overlooked
   Central Asian country, Uzbekistan, to test the relationship between
   particularized trust and demographic traits previously identified as
   influential. While a number of Uzbek demographic characteristics
   coincide with previously identified determinants of trust, age and
   education yield negative effects not previously found. Interestingly,
   individual-level demographic variables become insignificant when
   controlling for regional, religious, and linguistic variation. We
   conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Sadyr Japarov's first year in power as the newly
   elected President of the Kyrgyz Republic. In learning from the mistakes

   consolidate an authoritarian system. Japarov may ultimately succeed in
   this endeavor, but Kyrgyzstan will likely forfeit much of its
   sovereignty to Russia along with its quasi-democratic institutions in
   exchange for a strongman-style government.},

Title = {The Ethnic Identity of Turkmenistan's Baloch},
Journal = {ASIAN ETHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {181-195},
Abstract = {Some ethnic groups are remarkably resistant to surrounding influences,
   and only slightly undergo assimilation. What, then, are the most
   significant factors affecting ethnic assimilation? The foremost is state
   intervention. The state can support the nationalist tendencies of one
   group of inhabitants while suppressing the ethnic expressions of
   non-dominant groups. How do various ethnic groups respond to this kind
   of support or oppression? In this research note the Baloch minority, a
   relatively small group in Turkmenistan, have been chosen as a case study
   to examine the questions raised above. The chosen ethnic group under
   investigation here does not have a homeland to provide it with support.
   There are numerous such ethnic groups in non-dominant positions without
   states that cause tension between minorities and majorities. The tension
   is often extremely strong, even when such groups have political autonomy
   (e.g., the Kurds in Iraq and the Uyghurs in China). The aim of this
   report from the field is to explain how self-aware the Baloch of
   Turkmenistan are of their identity and the extent to which they have
   succumbed to modernization and attempts to render them Turkmen.},

Title = {Vowel harmony and positional variation in Kyrgyz},
Journal = {LABORATORY PHONOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {While it is well known that the phonetic realization of a segment may
   differ by position, it is unclear how positional variation interacts
   with vowel harmony, the imperative that vowels be identical along some
   phonological dimension. Pearce (2008, 2012) contends that phonological
   harmony blocks phonetic reduction, suggesting that phonology dictates
   phonetic realization for this class of assimilatory patterns. This paper
   investigates harmony and vowel reduction in Kyrgyz, finding that
   non-initial vowels are more centralized than their initial-syllable
   counterparts. The potential sources for this reduction, including
   initial strengthening, supralaryngeal declination, predictability, and
   undershoot are discussed. The proposed predictability-based analysis
   provides an analysis of reduction based on phonological knowledge and
   representations.},

Journal = {SOCIETY \& NATURAL RESOURCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {7},
Pages = {822-835},
Abstract = {We develop a social systems theory perspective on Central Asian
   post-Socialist transition, placing particular emphasis on the
   coordination problems in transboundary water governance. The extensive
   Soviet water-energy infrastructure around the Amudarya and Syrdarya
   rivers required coordination, but this could no longer be politically
   secured after the 1991 Soviet disintegration. According to the social
   systems theory of Niklas Luhmann, coordination problems are generally
   endemic to any modern regime of functional differentiation. We show that
   each Central Asia state had to tackle substantial internal adaptation
   problems, which were rendered even more formidable by the need for
   transboundary coordination. We further demonstrate how the new riparian
   states offer a complex picture of several forms of differentiation,
   where functional differentiation is in some ways reinforced by the new
   national boundaries and the collapse of Soviet planning. We identify
   possible sources of flexibility, opening up avenues toward adaptation
   and enhanced coordination across boundaries.},

Abstract = {Central Asian countries play a very important role in implementing the
   One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. The focus on agriculture is needed
   to streamline the implementation of the OBOR initiative. Agricultural
   trade between China and Central Asia has increased annually (18.34\%),
   and benefits complementarily among products. In this paper, we attempt
   to investigate whether OBOR initiative brings certain impacts to the
   Agricultural Trade of China and Central Asia. Using the panel dataset
   covering the period of 1992-2015, we employ System-Generalized Method of
   Moments (GMM) to estimate the dynamic gravity models. We find that OBOR
   increases the agricultural trade between China and Central Asia by
   8.8\%, and the growth of bilateral trade is contributed to the precise
   measures and policy under the OBOR. The governance capacity of Central
   Asian countries has noteworthy effects on China and Central Asian trade.
   Free trade agreements (FTA) have positive and significant relationship
   with bilateral trade.},

Title = {A void in Central Asia research: climate change},
Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Abstract = {This article assesses the extent to which the academic community engaged
   with climate change in Central Asia between 1991 and 2021. The article
   finds that climate change has been neglected in the field of Central
   Asia area studies. Out of a total 13,488 journal articles in eight key
   journals for Central Asia research, only 33 articles (0.24\%) were on
   climate change or a related topic. Climate change has been similarly
   neglected at the events of 17 Central Asia area studies associations.
   Out of 1305 conference panels, none was focused on climate change. Out
   of 10,249 individual presentations, only two (0.02\%) were focused on
   climate change. The very same scholars who have been most active in the
   securitization of Central Asia have ignored the severe security threats
   that climate change poses to the region. The article contributes to the
   field of Central Asian studies by drawing attention to severe knowledge
   gaps that hinder the Central Asian countries from adapting to climate
   change. It concludes with six recommendations.},

Abstract = {To what extent does Islam help explain the dynamics of a participatory
   civil society in the post-Soviet Muslim-majority Central Asia? More
   specifically, to what extent does the variation in Islam (personal
   religiosity) and political Islam (support for Islam's role in politics)
   help predict the propensity to engage in elite-challenging collective
   political actions, rooted in self-assertive social capital? Grounded in
   emancipative social capital theory, this article embarks on an
   individual-level quantitative analysis to systematically examine the
   variation in self-assertive collective action in four Central Asian
   republics. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the
   empirical nexus between general religiosity (Islam), Islamism (Political
   Islam), and elite-challenging collective actions and offers new clues on
   the empirical interactions between resurgent Islam and collective
   political participation in the post-Communist Muslim world.},

   businessman or intent to start their own business in Tashkent area were
   participated in this research and obtained information about their
   personal and professional motivation, experiences, and practices. Result
   showed that gender bias influences to women's entrepreneurship
   activities in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It is meanwhile, networking and
   mentoring is not an imperative challenge for females of Uzbekistan for
   undertaking entrepreneurship. Segmentation Model is recommended to be
   useful. Although, the measures and scales were tested from the point of
   only female entrepreneurship in the Uzbekistan area, the methodology
   may, therefore, by applied to opposite gender to compare the level of
   difference in motivation and challenges of undertaking entrepreneurship

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to illustrate the cultural changes
   that have taken place among Korean ethnic groups living in the Central
   Asian states of the former Soviet Union. Previous research on Korean
   minorities has demonstrated the impact of state intervention on the
   formation of ethnic identity. Despite a wide range of regional
   differences, those living in Korea in the nineteenth century belonged to
   one ethnic group. Once they left the northern part of the country for
   Russia, they began to adopt Russian culture relatively quickly.
   Following their deportation to Central Asia in the 1930s, they then
   experienced a largely Soviet model of inclusion into mainstream society.
   However, since the 1980s, when confronted with `original' Korean
   culture, they now consider themselves to be dissimilar to other Korean
   groups. The differences are already so substantial that Koreans
   themselves now talk about belonging to different nations.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the barriers to trade in Central Asia. While
   much of the existing literature on international integration of FSU
   countries has focused on the quantities traded, we use relative prices
   to shed some light on impediments to trade. We find that the impact of
   borders on price variations across different locations in Central Asia
   is much smaller than conventionally thought. While prices vary
   significantly across the region, variations within one country are just
   as large as variations across countries. We hypothesise (although we
   cannot prove) that this is due to obstacles to trade, and in particular
   rent seeking by enforcement agencies at the numerous internal check
   points. The paper also confirms that in relative terms, the borders with
   Uzbekistan are considerably more difficult to cross than those with
   Kazakhstan or the Kyrgyz Republic. Journal of Comparative Economics 36

Abstract = {Central Asia has always been at the centre of global power play, due to
   its geographic location in the centre of Eurasia and its abundant
   natural resources that have attracted world attention. It has, however,
   been caught in the vortex of international politics. An interplay of
   globalisation, technology and geopolitics is evident in the evolving
   Eurasian politics. Connectivity projects, rail, road and energy
   pipelines are criss-crossing the region. Its geographical proximity to
   Afghanistan-part of its geopolitical space-impinges on its efforts to
   build peace and stability. Regional cooperation is gradually taking
   shape in Central Asia and holds the promise of their status as
   independent entities. As Afghanistan is crucial for them, as well as for
   the world at large, understanding the security and economic issues of
   Central Asia becomes important. This article apart from highlighting the
   security and economic interests would also delineate the challenges
   accompanying these issues keeping the potential perspective in mind.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {404-415},
Abstract = {Water governance has emerged as one of the intense and most urgent
   challenges of the new century, largely due to the threatened nature of
   water availability and the transboundary character of water challenges.
   These conditions pose exceptionally high risks for societies that need
   to address these challenges. Using the concept of risk society as
   developed by Ulrich Beck, this article illustrates how shared risk among
   Central Asian countries provides the impetus for developing water
   governance mechanisms. However, the historical and sociocultural
   circumstances of these countries pose limits to their ability to craft
   workable governance arrangements; in particular, the Soviet legacy of
   centralised command-and-control governance over water and related ethnic
   tensions among countries. These tensions play out in the demarcation of
   water boundaries and the subsequent allocation of water resources among
   the riparian countries. However, these limitations can also be viewed
   through the lens of `reflexive governance', which allows for
   flexibility, hybridisation, uncertainty and even ignorance.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes patterns of long-term economic performance in all
   five Central Asian countries. We first look at sources of economic
   growth based on a simple growth accounting exercise. Our findings show
   that under the period of study total factor productivity growth rates
   were modest ranging from 1.7\% for Kazakhstan, 1.4\% for Uzbekistan, and
   0.8\% for Tajikistan and Turkmenistan to-0.4\% for the Kyrgyz Republic.
   The second part of the paper is connected with exploring productivity
   level analysis across all Central Asian countries by decomposing
   differences in output per worker into differences in capital intensity
   and productivity. Results reflect different levels of productivity
   performance in the region compared with Japan and South Korea as
   frontier economies for the analysis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {25},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Background: The five Central Asian republics comprise of Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Their research and
   publication activities are gradually improving but there is limited data
   on how good their peer reviewing practices are.
   Methods: We have use the Publons database to extract information on the
   reviewers registered including the number of verified review, Publons
   award winners, and top universities in the domain of peer reviewing.
   This has been analysed overall and country wise.
   Results: Of 15,764 researchers registered on Publons, only 370 (11.7\%)
   have verified records of peer-reviewing. There are 8 Publons award
   winners. There is great heterogeneity in the number of active reviewers
   across the five countries. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan account for more
   than 90\% of verified reviewers. Only Kazakhstan has more than 100
   active reviewers and 6 Publons award recipients. Amongst the top 20
   reviewers from Central Asia, half of them are from the Nazarbayev
   University, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. Three countries have less than 10
   universities registered on Publons.
   Conclusion: Central Asia has a good number of peer reviewers on Publons
   though only a minority of researchers are involved in peer reviewing.
   However, the heterogeneity between the nations can be best dealt with by
   promoting awareness and international networking including e-learning
   and mentoring programs.},

Abstract = {In International Relations, ``Central Asia{''} and ``power{''} are often
   linked to either Great Power politics or authoritarianism. Yet, as
   ``power{''} is a multifaceted component of social life, this paper
   suggests a comprehensive framework to analyze its different
   understandings and operations in the region. By adopting the typology of
   Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall, the paper has three aims. First, to
   review the recent literature on power and Central Asia showing that
   ``power{''} is a pervasive but undertheorized concept. Second, to
   broaden the understanding of ``power{''} in the region. Third, to
   encourage reflexivity when it comes to power analysis.},

Abstract = {The present-day world is enmeshed in global networks. The information
   space has been formed according to rules of Internet and electronic
   messaging and ensures instantaneous communication and momentary
   dissemination of any news, thus bringing about apparent unity of the
   world. Other networks (financial, trade, economic, legal and
   institutional) have their own rules, while being in motion and
   interacting with each other they represent a phenomenon of
   globalization. In the water sector, with its several aspects, this
   process has influenced politics, economy, technology, environment,
   culture, ideology and even religion since the 1950s. Each globalization
   aspect produced its effect on the water sector in countries, regions,
   and the world, even in periods and countries where the sector was
   developed independently. These aspects play different roles at each
   development stage. The degrees to which globalization penetrates at
   regional and national levels are different, dependent on the degree of
   the anti-effect of governance. Dynamics of the processes are quite
   representative in Central Asia, which despite being behind the Iron
   Curtain for a long time could not withstand global trends and
   tendencies. The influence of ``globalism{''} on the water sector in
   Central Asia is presented in this paper. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley

Abstract = {In June 2010, a bloody conflict took place in southern Kyrgyzstan. In
   inter-ethnic clashes, more than 470 people were killed, and more than
   110 000 became refugees. The Independent International Commission, of
   which the author was one of seven members, found that certain attacks
   against Uzbeks might constitute crimes against humanity. The article
   analyses the political context of the crisis, the role of
   ethno-nationalism in its genesis as well as difficulties and challenges
   the Government and people of Kyrgyzstan face in building an inclusive
   society where all ethnicities feel at home. The article scrutinizes the
   June events and following developments in the light of international,
   including human rights, law. Comparative analysis allows a singling-out
   of what in the Kyrgyz crisis may be specific for this country and what
   lessons other societies may learn to avoid similar conflicts.},

Abstract = {Since gaining independence, Central Asian countries have created and
   joined many regional economic organizations. It is not clear whether
   these organizations, especially the Eurasian Economic Community
   (EurAsEC), have boosted integration of this region. In this paper, I
   conclude that exports of Central Asian countries have benefited from
   integration but EurAsEC has failed to live up to the expectations of its
   member states. This is due mainly to the different levels of economic
   development, defective industrial structures, and poor marketization in
   EurAsEC member states. At present, an initial market-based trade
   integration network has formed in Central Asia and has had excellent
   accomplishments, but the governments of Central Asian countries have
   still not realized the network's function and advantage.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {80},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {President Putin has presided over a proactive, hard-headed and
   relatively effective Russian policy in Central Asia and the Caspian
   region since at least the summer Of 2002, which aims both to support
   Russia's revival as an economic and military power and to help tackle at
   source new security challenges from the volatile south. In line with
   rising domestic nationalist thinking and the growing influence of
   officials with a security service or military background, Moscow has
   been searching for a rationale to support a more assertive policy in the
   region. Meanwhile, Russian and American views on the scope and conduct
   of the war on terrorism have diverged in important respects. Russia
   lacks an overall regional strategy for Central Asia, but is seeking to
   mesh together geopolitical, security and energy policy goals. It is
   seeking to reinvigorate its military-security influence in Central Asia
   under the banner of counterterrorism and at the same time has achieved
   long-term agreements for energy transit and purchases that make Central
   Asian states increasingly dependent on Russia in energy policy. Overall,
   a dynamic of competition is displacing the potential for cooperation
   between Russia and western states, especially the United States, in
   Central Asia. The prospects for a fully-fledged strategic partnership in
   the region are fading but the reality of security threats from
   Afghanistan and within Central Asia might eventually reconcile Moscow to
   a lower profile but long-term western strategic presence in the region.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the interconnections among society, ritual,
   and art in present-day Kyrgyzstan as manifested in koshok, a ritualized
   expression of grief in which melody is paired with affective
   performance. Like other ritualized performances of emotion, koshok
   incorporates a spectrum of learned affective behavior; thus phrases,
   utterances, vocal qualities, movements, gestures, and stances expressed
   in koshok are also dispersed throughout a range of non-ritual social
   activity. The transposition of koshok performance into new contexts and.
   alternative media has lent new meanings and possibilities to the genre.
   For instance, mediated koshok as performed during a period of national
   mourning for the writer Chingiz Aitmatov demonstrated how ritual and art
   can be used by the state for the purpose of nation building. At the same
   time, it satisfies a desire to participate in a broader human experience
   as imagined through the shared experience of sorrow and beauty.},

Abstract = {This article examines the record of American policy towards regional
   cooperation in Central Asia. It begins with the determinants of
   regionalism and the role of external states therein. It then considers
   the nature of American interests in Central Asia. This is followed by a
   historical account of the three stages of American policy towards the
   region. The article argues that regional cooperation has not been a
   significant aspect of US policy. Instead US policy-makers have preferred
   bilateral relations or multilateral structures (e.g. the Partnership for
   Peace, the GUUAM {[}Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and
   Moldova] group) which draw the region's states beyond its boundaries. US
   policy tends to reduce incentives for regional actors to develop
   multilateral cooperation. It may also encourage competitive regionalist
   agendas on the part of other interested major powers (Russia and China).},

Abstract = {The anthropology of Central Asia provides socially situated,
   ethnographically grounded analyses that complicate grand narratives of
   post-Soviet transformations in this understudied and undertheorized
   region. Coalescing as a field with the sudden outsider access since the
   Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, western anthropological research in
   Central Asia is only beginning to contribute to current conceptual
   debates in anthropology. This review surveys the English-language
   literature, focused on the ex-Soviet republics Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Azerbaijan, with comparative references to
   Xinjiang, China. Themes revolve around economic survival strategies amid
   upheaval, traditionalist revivals in nationalizing states, Soviet rule's
   peculiar productivity of culture and imaginaries, post-9/11 Islamic
   modalities, the nature of state power, and the importance of Cold War
   epistemologies in critiquing this literature. It considers fruitful
   future directions of research within a post-Cold War frame.},

Abstract = {Among the many `businesspeople' whom the promise of commercial success
   has drawn to southern China in recent years one can find a small number
   of Kyrgyz middlemen. Working mostly with Russian-speaking clients, their
   job is to organize buying trips, coordinate with local manufacturers,
   translate, and oversee cargo shipments. Based on ethnographic fieldwork
   since 2013, this article examines in detail the careers, work routines
   and business model adopted by Kyrgyz middlemen in Guangzhou. I argue
   that in contrast to the early bazaar or shuttle traders, who have been
   operating across Eurasia since the 1990s, these Kyrgyz middlemen
   constitute a next kind of economic actor within more diversified,
   service-oriented and formalized value chains across post-Socialist
   Eurasia (referred to here as Business 2.0). One of these middlemen's
   most salient contributions is to translate between the informal and
   formal domains of national economies as well as within cross-border
   economic transactions.},

   positive multicultural attitudes through language learning initiatives
   in schools and universities. This article reports on a questionnaire
   study that investigated the LLM of 235 university students in Kazakhstan
   and Uzbekistan, including their integrativeness and international
   posture. The students were learning Arabic, Chinese, English, French,
   German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish, with a majority of them
   learning two or more languages concurrently. The study also explored
   their views regarding the benefits of being multilingual and the extent
   to which their level of multilingualism, both formally and natively
   acquired, affected their multicultural attitudes and levels of prejudice
   towards outgroups. The findings revealed statistically significant
   gender differences in how the participants viewed the benefits of being
   multilingual, as well as statistically significant relationships between
   their levels of natively acquired multilingualism and their
   multicultural attitudes and levels of prejudice towards outgroups.
   International posture and integrativeness, meanwhile, were found to be
   distinct concepts with little overlap.},

Title = {Farm Reform in Uzbekistan},
Booktitle = {COTTON, WATER, SALTS AND SOUMS: ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL RESTRUCTURING IN
   KHOREZM, UZBEKISTAN},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {95-112},
Abstract = {Land-reform processes are catalyzing agricultural transition in the
   Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and this is well illustrated
   by the process of farm restructuring in Uzbekistan. In Khorezm, a region
   in the northwest of the country, this process is mirrored in the
   nationwide reforms: state-induced farm restructuring, state ownership of
   land, land reform to transfer land from collective to individual use,
   and continuation of area-based state targets for cotton at fixed prices.
   This study has the following two key objectives: (1) to explain how the
   land reform has changed the production structure in private farms, and
   (2) to describe the main changes in private farming during the reform
   process. The development of private farming since independence in 1991
   has taken place in four phases, which are distinguished by the speed of
   reform, number and average size of farms, their structural
   specialization, and changes in the farms' cropping pattern. In the first
   two phases, farm restructuring led to a downsizing of producing units
   and to many independent farmers in coexistence with the old farming
   system. In the following period, the old system was completely
   dismantled. The final and most recent phase, imposed by national policy,
   has reversed this trend, and farms were increased to sizes similar to
   those in Soviet times; many farmers had to give back their long-term
   lease contract. Although it was expected that sooner or later farms
   would have to be larger to obtain viable and sustainable production
   units, it is argued that changing farm size alone, without any other
   supportive structural measures, will not provide sufficient incentives
   for reaching economically efficient farm enterprises. Along all stages
   of the farm restructuring process, the setup of agricultural
   infrastructure did not change much, or if it did change, then by
   state-imposed initiatives, which is constraining the development of
   farms and sustainable farming systems and practices.},

Journal = {IRAN AND THE CAUCASUS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-99},
Abstract = {The Balochi dialect spoken in Turkmenistan possesses a case which is not
   seen in most other Balochi dialects. It has local/directive function,
   and its marker is a suffix that shows the oblique case marker suffixed
   to the genitive ending. The ``locative{''} is also found in the Balochi
   dialect of Afghanistan, but here, the local deixis appears to always
   refer to a person. I argue that the locative may be interpreted within a
   typological framework implying that local deixis referring to persons is
   blocked in some languages. Instead, these languages use periphrastic
   constructions of the type ``at a person's {[}place]{''}, as do English
   (e.g. at the baker's) and Old Georgian, among others. In Turkmenistan
   Balochi, areal influence from Russian and Turkmen, which have a separate
   locative case, may have played a role in the generalisation of the
   locative to include inanimates as well.},

Title = {The Energy Factor in Iran-Turkmenistan Relations},
Journal = {IRANIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {45},
Number = {6},
Pages = {745-758},
Abstract = {The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about major upheavals in
   Central Asia and the Caucasus. Among the newly independent states, those
   that were endowed with energy resources set out on the path of economic
   growth. The energy resources in Central Asia also attracted outside
   powers to the region. Moreover, the status of these countries as
   landlocked, and Russia's monopoly over energy pipelines, led these
   countries to search for new partners in order to reduce their
   dependency. This added a new dimension to the political, economic and
   security equations of the region. In this article, Turkmenistan is
   studied as a former Soviet republic and Iran as a regional actor that
   has interests in the region's energy dynamics. The role of energy in the
   relations between Turkmenistan and Iran is examined. The article
   proposes that the energy factor has produced a favorable atmosphere for
   closer relations between the two countries. However, Tehran needs to
   overcome a number of challenges in expansion of its relations with
   Turkmenistan, the most important of which is the United States'
   effective opposition to any Iranian initiative in the field of energy in
   the region.},

Abstract = {A reexamination of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) documents
   reveals that the agency played a more direct role in the ghettoization
   of African Americans than previous scholarship has established. The FHA
   went far beyond merely approving of racial discrimination, and exploring
   the extent to which it did so is crucial to understanding the origins of
   urban racial inequality in America. Agency publications, many of them
   largely passed over by historians, called unequivocally for the
   containment of African Americans in the older residential neighborhoods
   where they were most likely to settle after migrating to the city. The
   agency then disguised its leadership in advancing a national
   segregationist agenda by deflecting blame onto the private market for
   policies that it had standardized and mandated. For nearly a decade
   after the Supreme Court invalidated one of its core racial programs, the
   FHA resisted providing greater opportunities for African Americans in
   the housing market.},

Journal = {ADDICTION},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {95},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1319-1333},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a picture of how the patterns of opium use have
   changed in Turkmenistan over more than 100 years a,ld the relationship
   between these transformations and formal and informal social controls of
   drug use. From the late 18th century, when opium use began to become a
   social problem, informal control weakened. Eventually, in the late 19th
   century, formal control was introduced aimed at the prohibition of drug
   trade and use. From that time, the intended and unintended outcomes of
   implemented policies led to changes in the demographic patterns of users
   and the social-medical consequences of opiate use. The anti-drug
   policies, where criminal prohibition coexisted with strategies aimed at
   raising the population's general living standards and at providing free
   access to health care, were effective up to the early 1980s. New
   political and social-economic realities in the 1980-90s have radically
   changed the drug scene in the country, with heroin trade and use as the
   main concerns. The government's reaction, while following the old paths,
   has included new elements, based mainly on ideas of national
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disbanding of state
   farms, on-farm irrigation was in chaos. Many republics replaced their
   production brigades with water user associations (WUAs). In the Kyrgyz
   Republic, with World Bank support, the Department of Water Resources
   (DWR) established WUAs to take over on-farm irrigation operation and
   maintenance (O\&M). To ensure these were participatory, in 2002 the
   Republic passed a WUA Law. To date 451 WUAs have been legally registered
   under this law. As farmers had no experience with participatory
   associations, an intensive capacity development program was critical for
   success. Within the DWR WUA Support Units (SUs) at the central (1),
   provincial (7) and district (40) level were formed. International
   consultants and Central SU staff members provided more than 3000 days of
   training for staff members of SUs. In turn, SUs have provided more than
   47 000 days of training for WUAs. Interactions with SUs and intensive
   training have strengthened WUA boards and encouraged member
   participation. Monitoring data documents increased the efficiency of
   water delivery, while fees paid by WUA members have increased annually
   in every province. WUAs have now formed 14 WUA federations responsible
   for off-farm O\&M. The success of these federations requires advanced
   capacity development for leaders and management staff. Copyright (C)

Title = {Sustainable energy transition in Central Asia: status and challenges},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Background The paper aims at gaining insight into the implementation of
   the process of sustainable energy transition in the countries of Central
   Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
   Uzbekistan. Information and scientific studies on the situation in these
   countries is scarce. On the other hand, these are resource-rich
   countries, some are exporters, and all are energy transit countries. The
   main aim of the paper was realized by applying the energy policies and
   regulatory framework analysis, defining priorities and monitoring
   selected indicators prescribed by the International Energy Agency.
   Methods The following methods were used in the quantitative analysis:
   measurement of data intercorrelation; Pearson test of correlation;
   principal component analysis (with rotation method: Oblimin with Kaiser
   normalization); Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy,
   Bartlett's test of sphericity and t-test. The period covered by the
   quantitative analysis: 1990-2018, provided that the available data for
   2019 or 2020 were used in certain cases. Results Sustainable energy
   transition is, at the analysis of policies and data, at a low level.
   There is no adequate regulatory framework in these countries. The energy
   transition takes place exclusively within the framework of providing
   enough energy, without regard to sustainability, while even energy
   exporting countries are not making efforts to achieve a sustainable
   energy transition. Conclusions There are no indications that the energy
   transition in the countries of Central Asia will take place according to
   the standards of the European Union or global bodies. On the other hand,
   having in mind the natural resources of the mentioned countries and the
   specific geopolitical position, monitoring the changes is of special
   importance. The impact of changes on sustainability can be determined
   mainly ex post.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors describe the characteristics of Germany's
   foreign policy in Central Asia, which is included in the Common Foreign
   and Security Policy of the European Union. The aim of the article is to
   study the mutual conditioning of German and European politics in Central
   Asia, as well as the influence of other actors on these processes. The
   study used the paradigms of regional studies such as globalisation
   theories and postmodern theory, since the topic of the study is regional
   studies, affecting the regions of Europe and Central Asia. The theory of
   postmodernism and the theory of network integration were used to study
   the features of the trade and economic relations of states in the era of
   the post-industrial, information society. In the study context of the
   European Union and Russia crisis report on the relationship between the
   Federal Republic of Germany and Central Asian Republics, the smart power
   theory was used. The result of the analytical work is the identification
   of the general and the private in the relations of the Central Asian
   states with Germany and the European Union.},

   the five Central Asian states evolving into a region capable of solving

   water-related events. The empirical findings suggest that international
   relations of the Central Asian states are characterised by at least two
   sets of triads rather than a singular region. The presence of regional
   fragmentation is likely to exacerbate existing disputes over water and
   possibly destabilise the region.},

Title = {NEUTRALITY IN PERPETUITY: FOREIGN POLICY CONTINUITY IN TURKMENISTAN},
Journal = {ASIAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Pages = {779-794},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Since the passing of Turkmenistan's first president, Saparmurat Niyazov,
   in late 2006, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has ruled over Turkmenistan.
   Although authoritarian regimes occasionally undergo reform following a
   transition from one leader to the next, the dictatorship in Ashgabat
   remains intact and Berdymukhamedov has not modified his predecessor's
   foreign policy doctrine. Why though has Turkmenistan chosen not to
   revise its ``permanent neutrality{''} status under new leadership? This
   article stipulates that the ruling elites in Ashgabat have preserved
   Turkmenistan's neutrality for three reasons. First, in contrast to other
   isolated dictatorships, the government of Turkmenistan does not have to
   contend against any state adversaries or antagonize a foreign power to
   legitimate its rule. Instead, Turkmenistan portrays itself in the United
   Nations General Assembly as an exemplary neutral state and this affords
   the regime latitude in navigating geopolitics. Second, while
   Berdymukhamedov has revised aspects of the Niyazov dictatorship,
   theArkadagpersonality cult heralds him as the ``protector{''} of
   Turkmenistan's sovereignty. ``Permanent neutrality{''} thus undergirds
   the president's political legitimacy to some degree. Third,
   Turkmenistan's neutrality contributes to the ruling elites' maintenance
   of a corrupt and repressive regime through which they exert control over
   the economy. Hence, in spite of many challenges facing the country, the
   ruling regime will likely endure.},

Title = {Climate change and international water conflict in Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {227-239},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We engage in a critical assessment of the neo-malthusian claim that
   climatic changes can be an important source of international tensions,
   in the extreme even militarized interstate disputes. The most likely
   scenario is conflict over water allocation in international catchments
   shared by poorer, less democratic, and politically less stable
   countries, governed by weak international water management institutions,
   and exposed to severe climatic changes. The Syr Darya corresponds quite
   well to all these characteristics. If the neo-malthusian specter of
   conflict over water is empirically relevant, we should see signs of this
   in the Syr Darya. The riparian countries of the Aral Sea basin have
   experienced international disputes over water allocation ever since the
   USSR collapsed and, with it, existing water management institutions and
   funding. The worst such dispute concerns the Syr Darya, one of the two
   largest rivers in Central Asia. Based on hydrological data and other
   information we find that the only existing international water
   management institution in the Syr Darya has failed. Based on a coupled
   climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya, we then
   examine whether, in the absence of an effective international water
   allocation mechanism, climate change is likely to make existing
   international tensions over water allocation worse. We find that climate
   change-induced shifts in river runoff, to which the Uzbek part of the
   Syr Darya catchment is particularly vulnerable, and which could
   contribute to a deterioration of already strained Kyrgyz-Uzbek
   relations, are likely to set in only in the medium to long term. This
   leaves some time for the riparian countries to set up an effective
   international framework for water allocation and prevention of
   climate-induced geohazards. By implication, our findings suggest that a
   climate change-induced militarized interstate dispute over water
   resources in Central Asia is unlikely.},

Title = {The EU in Central Asia: successful good governance promotion?},
Journal = {THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-103},
Abstract = {A reappraisal of security and economic interests has led to increased
   engagement by the European Union with Central Asia in the past few
   years. As a new foreign policy tool the EU adopted a new partnership
   strategy for Central Asia in 2007. The strategy aims to integrate both
   interest-based and governance-related policy ambitions. In the two years
   since the strategy was adopted activities concerning the implementation
   of good governance-related initiatives are still rather weak. This
   article discusses the obstacles and prospects for good governance
   promotion in Central Asia. The prospects for external good governance
   promotion in stable authoritarian environments are limited. Domestic
   economic pressure increases the willingness of the Central Asian
   incumbent governments to enter into international agreements and widens
   the scope of external good governance promotion. Yet the prioritisation
   of interest-based policy objectives and the reluctance to employ
   conditionalities on the part of the EU provide an opportunity for the
   Central Asian regimes to limit their concessions and feign reforms.
   Initiatives focusing on grassroots levels appear to be the most
   promising in terms of the diffusion of ideas of good governance and
   democracy.},

Abstract = {This article answers the question of why Central Asia studies has not
   contributed more fully to the study of comparative politics since the

   Central Asia remained a dark matter to Western scholars specializing in
   Sovietology and who lacked access to the region. Although in the 1990s
   Western academics saw the `light at the end of the tunnel', expecting
   Central Asia to join the liberal world order, these hopes declined after
   the 2000s when not only the transition paradigm failed, but also because
   a consolidated form of authoritarianism closed access to the field. In
   conclusion, this article offers the most promising fields for the
   development of the study of comparative politics across and inside

   Life in Transition Surveys, it examines differences in redistributive
   preferences across countries and time, as well as determinants of
   individual preferences, testing for motivations such as self-interest,
   past and expected future social mobility, beliefs about fairness, as
   well as ideology and risk preferences. The extent to which different
   groups are perceived as deserving of government support is found to vary
   considerably, with the disabled, the elderly and families with children
   being the most favoured groups. The motives for redistribution towards
   different groups are also not uniform - self-interest appears to be a
   basis for assistance to the elderly and families with children, whereas
   values and beliefs are associated with support for the working poor and
   the unemployed.},

Abstract = {Sheik Sufi Akhmet Khazini's works are of great value in defining the
   relationship between sufis and great sufis spread in Central Asia. His
   manuscripts that were kept in Turkey and France have been the main data
   of the paper. Akhmet Khazini's life was discussed, his political and
   religious principles were defined through the above mentioned sources.
   The author of the paper verifies that Akhmet Khazini has been a sheik of
   two big religions. The author also informs us about his political and
   religious situation during that period. The activeness of sufi in his
   religion as well as political pursuit in Buhara caused Akhmet Khazini to
   relocate to Osman country from there. However, Sheikh showed that he
   preferred collaboration to competitiveness in his principles. On the
   basis of a comprehensive analysis of Shaykh's activities, his religious
   and political parties was revealed. Therefore, Ahmad Khazini should be
   seen as a spiritual person as well as a politician.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the impact of infrastructure on trade in
   Central Asia based on the data of three countries: Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Empirical estimations are based on panel
   data for the period 2010-2018. Infrastructure is measured by quality and
   quantity indicators. Trade flows are measured by the export and import
   volumes of each of these countries with their main trade partner
   countries. The results show that both the quality and quantity of
   infrastructure in Central Asia have a positive impact on trade flows.
   However, the positive impact of infrastructure over trade demonstrates a
   diminishing trend. Given the general remote geographical location of
   Central Asian countries, the findings of this study indicate that a
   regional approach to the development of infrastructure is important and
   that policy towards infrastructure development should be associated with
   a government policy that facilitates international trade.},

Abstract = {Millions of people in the geopolitically important region of Central
   Asia depend on water from snow- and glacier-melt driven international
   rivers, most of all the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The riparian countries
   of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts
   ever since the Soviet Union collapsed. Will climate change exacerbate
   water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate,
   land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts
   and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff
   seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in
   unregulated catchments because less water will be available for
   irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all
   glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at
   highest risk is the densely populated, agriculturally productive, and
   politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural
   developments will be required in the region. If the current
   mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more
   effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of
   transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully
   address these future climate-related challenges.},

   better access to regional markets including Pakistan, China, India, and
   the countries of West Asia. Pakistan and China have huge energy demands
   that can be satisfied by growing trade with Central Asia. Thus, the CPEC
   will not only benefit Pakistan and China, but it also presents a
   strategic opportunity for Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,

Abstract = {This paper compares Japanese and Chinese infrastructure development
   strategies in post-Soviet Central Asia (CA) by analyzing the
   similarities and differences in the approaches of the two Asian economic
   powers. This paper develops several arguments with respect to the
   Japanese and Chinese approaches to infrastructure development in CA.
   This paper argues that the discourse of mutually exclusive interests in
   China and Japan's development of various infrastructure-related projects
   in CA is empirically unproven. Most of the Chinese engagements emphasize
   the creation of energy and transportation infrastructure (construction),
   while Japan's main areas of focus are the maintenance, modernization,
   and rehabilitation of current infrastructure. Thus, this paper suggests
   that China positions itself as CA's leading economic partner, while
   Japan is CA's leading assistance provider. These two roles have
   different implications. Furthermore, the current infrastructure
   engagements of Japan (from assistance to partnership) and China (from
   exploitation to contribution to the region) in CA demonstrate both
   countries' attempts to adjust and search for new opportunities.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a set of recent nationally-representative surveys, this study
   examines Early Childhood Care and Education attendance in Central Asia.
   Between 12\% and 22\% of children attended ECCE, while the number of
   attendance hours was irregular and varied greatly. Having a mother with
   lower education and being from a poorer household reduced the likelihood
   of attendance in all countries. Living in a rural area reduced the
   likelihood of attendance in all countries except Kazakhstan. Other
   factors associated with lower likelihood of attendance varied across
   countries and included having an additional child under 5 in the
   household, an increase in child age, and residing in a non-Russian
   speaking household. In terms of frequency of attendance, living in
   capital cities was associated with an increase in attendance frequency
   in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, while residing in a wealthier household
   was associated with an increase in frequency in Tajikistan and
   Kyrgyzstan. Measures to improve ECCE attendance are discussed. (C) 2012

Title = {China, Xinjiang, and the transnational security of Central Asia},
Journal = {CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {113-142},
Abstract = {Asia is not a Westphalian system. Transnational politics, in which
   political communities are subdivided by nominally sovereign boundaries,
   are just as common in Asia as international politics. This
   non-Westphalianism is also a persistent feature of Asian security, as
   subnational, transnational, and international conflicts are embedded in
   each other. This article examines China's security relations with
   Central Asia in terms of these features, beginning with a discussion of
   the developmental and ethno-national politics of China's Xinjiang Uyghur
   Autonomous Region. The Chinese state has advanced a program of economic
   modernization and intensive security campaigns to eradicate what it
   terms the ``three evils{''} of splittism, terrorism, and extremism and
   to promote a common political identity for modern China. But this
   campaign has resulted in a segregated Xinjiang in which Uyghurs still
   look to a transnational community outside of China as an alternative to
   political assimilation. The second part of the article examines the
   interaction between transnational and international security in Central
   Asia, and China's promotion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as
   its preferred mechanism for managing this relationship. The authors
   identify three aims of the SCO - repressing transnational radicalism;
   stabilizing regional regimes and their foreign policy orientations; and
   checking U. S. influence - but argue that these are more restraints on
   the political options of others than a means to expand China's own
   options. The fact that the problems of China's transnational regions and
   the future of SCO remain unresolved leads the authors to conclude that
   an ascendant China faces an uncertain future in the fluid environment of
   Central Eurasia.},

Title = {Evaluation of development potential of cropland in Central Asia},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With population growth and rapid urbanization, agricultural land has
   become a relatively scarce resource. Given the vast land area in Central
   Asia, exploring the potential of agricultural land development in
   Central Asia is a realistic guide to the rational use of land and the
   alleviation of strained human-land relations and food shortage problems.
   In this study, Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Analytic
   Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used to construct a cropland development
   potential evaluation system in Central Asia. The results showed that:
   (1) The development of current cropland basically adapts to local
   natural conditions in Central Asia. Suitable irrigated cropland is
   mainly located in areas with low elevation and close to water sources
   such as rivers and canals. Suitable rain-fed cropland is mainly located
   in the areas with flat terrain and sufficient rainfall. (2) The land
   resources of Central Asia still have a large potential for development:
   1,008,000 km(2) for the irrigated cropland and 217,124 km(2) for the
   rain-fed cropland, mainly concentrated in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
   The final evaluation results on a province-level scale presented in this
   study provide a direct and effective reference for future cropland
   development in Central Asian countries.},

Abstract = {This study examines monetary policy efficiency in Central Asia by
   investigating the monetary transmission mechanism in the region's
   economies. To examine monetary policy efficiency, it is necessary to
   take into account factors that might impede the transmission, such as
   high levels of dollarization, weak financial sectors, underdeveloped
   capital Markets, and low monetization of economies. Empirical findings
   confirm the importance of exchange rate pass-through in transition
   economies with high dollarization. The findings also provide an
   empirical case for deepening the local financial sectors to improve the
   efficiency of monetary policy and to improve resilience to external and

Abstract = {The US State Department increasingly relies on efforts of public
   diplomacy to improve America's image abroad. We test the theoretical
   efficacy of these efforts through an experiment. Participants were
   recruited in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. All but those participants
   randomly assigned to a control group read a quote about religious
   tolerance and pluralism in the United States. We varied the attribution
   of this quote to President Bush, to an unnamed US Ambassador, to an
   ordinary American, or to no one. We then asked respondents a battery of
   questions about their opinions of the United States before and after a
   long discussion with other participants about the United States. We find
   that the identity of the messenger matters, as those who read the quote
   attributed to Bush tended to have lower opinions of the United States.
   After the discussion, these views partially dissipated. Post-discussion
   views were more heavily influenced by how other participants viewed the
   United States. After controlling for the source and location of the
   discussion, when the discussion took place among people with more
   positive initial views of the United States, views of the United States
   improved. However, when there was a large range of views in the
   discussion, post-discussion views of the United States were relatively
   worse. Based on this study, we suggest new directions for the conduct of
   public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The security dimension of regionalism and regional structures in Central
   Asia and Azerbaijan has been limited by Russia's influence as a regional
   hegemon, as well as by various other constraints specific to the region
   and the local states. Moreover, as a peripheral zone in the world
   system, Central Eurasia has not shown much evidence of regionalization
   as a process. But in response to the proximity of hegemonic power the
   smaller states have tried to adopt bandwagoning and balancing strategies
   in regional formats. Although their fixation on `regime security' has
   encouraged them to accommodate Russia through CIS structures, this is
   changing as new bilateral security relationships develop with the United
   States. The Russian-sponsored Collective Security Treaty Organization is
   unable to address the most serious challenges for regional security
   management in Central Asia. Yet the local states have been unable on
   their own to establish a regional security consensus and to
   institutionalize cooperation on that basis. The diffuse GUUAM grouping
   (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova) has not offered a
   basis for self-sustaining regional security cooperation. The Shanghai
   Cooperation Organization has created a venue to engage China in the
   security dialogue on Central Asia, particularly over counterterrorism,
   but has otherwise failed to tackle security challenges among and within
   the Central Asian states. Overall, the current focus of these states and
   their sponsors on bilateral relations to provide security assistance
   continues to displace security-related regionalism.},

Title = {Redistributive preferences in Europe and Central Asia, 2006-2016{*}},
Journal = {ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE},
Abstract = {This paper analyses support for reducing inequality and for
   redistribution to specific groups in Europe and Central Asia. Using the
   Life in Transition Surveys, it examines differences in redistributive
   preferences across countries and time, as well as determinants of
   individual preferences, testing for motivations such as self-interest,
   past and expected future social mobility, beliefs about fairness, as
   well as ideology and risk preferences. The extent to which different
   groups are perceived as deserving of government support is found to vary
   considerably, with the disabled, the elderly and families with children
   being the most favoured groups. The motives for redistribution towards
   different groups are also not uniform - self-interest appears to be a
   basis for assistance to the elderly and families with children, whereas
   values and beliefs are associated with support for the working poor and
   the unemployed.},

Abstract = {The disintegration of the Soviet Union spurred a transnational trade in
   consumer goods. Bazaars, which proliferated across the former Soviet
   Union, including in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan that is the focus of this
   article, became nodes in this informal trade. This article makes three
   arguments: (i) Soviet successor states capitalised on the new informal
   economy which provided employment to millions when economies were in
   decline. Conversely, ongoing developments, particularly in Kazakhstan,
   seek to modernise the bazaars that emerged after the Soviet Union. (ii)
   The movement of people and goods - between border and bazaar, and in
   case of re-exports, on to another border - are illustrative of a
   multi-dimensional informal economy evidenced in rent extraction,
   regulation of bazaars, and in trader networks. (iii) The bazaar-centred
   economy relies on checkpoint politics that establish border regimes,
   enabling mobility.},

Title = {Regionalism in Central Asia: new geopolitics, old regional order},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {485+},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Behind the rhetoric of regional cooperation, the Central Asian states
   have been embroiled with increasing frequency in conflicts among
   themselves, including trade wars, border disputes and disagreements over
   the management and use of water and energy resources. Far from
   engendering a new regional order in Central Asia, the events of
   September 11, 2001 and the subsequent basing of US troops in the region
   have served to entrench pre-existing patterns of regional cooperation,
   while highlighting the obstacles that have beset the regionalization
   process there since the mid-1990s. While all five Central Asian states
   have been attempting to use the renewed rivalry between Russia and the
   United States, which is being played out in the Central Asian region, to
   maximize their strategic and economic benefits, the formation of the
   United States-Uzbekistan strategic partnership has increased the resolve
   of the other Central Asian states (Turkmenistan excepted) to balance
   Uzbekistan's preponderance by enthusiastically pursuing regional
   projects involving Russia and, to a lesser extent, China. This regional
   dynamic has resulted in the steady gravitation of the centre of
   regionalism in Central Asia to the north from a nominal Tashkent-Astana
   axis to a more stable Astana-Moscow one, with possible repercussions for
   the poorer states of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The article examines the
   major constraints on regionalism in Central Asia, considering in
   particular the ways in which the personalist, non-democratic regimes of
   Central Asia have obstructed state-centric `top-down' regionalism as
   well as informal regionalist processes `from below'.},

Abstract = {The purpose of our paper is to contribute to the literature on autocracy
   promotion by analyzing Central Asia as the most-likely case, considering
   both Russia and China as relevant external actors. We develop a concept
   for our analysis based on the different strategies of Russia and China
   towards the region and present the results of a qualitative study of the
   main dimensions of autocracy promotion (regional organizations, economic
   cooperation, and interference and threat). Based on this qualitative
   study, we define variables measuring the potential for autocracy
   promotion and test our hypotheses using panel data for 24 post-communist
   countries. The somewhat surprising result of our analysis is that, in
   contrast to Russia's dominance mode of operation, China's doing-business
   approach towards its neighbors in Central Asia may have-although
   unintentionally-even positive effects in terms of improving governance
   and undermining autocratic structures.},

Title = {A reproduction of Luria' s expedition to Central Asia},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {7-16},
Abstract = {Background. About 40 years ago, Alexander Luria published in 1974 his
   world known book ``On the historical development of cognitive
   processes{''}. It describes the data of an experimental study of mental
   functions in illiterate people living in the peripheral parts of
   Uzbekistan (Central Asia). A.R. Luria together with L.S. Vygotsky worked
   out the design of this study, performed in 1931-1933. The study proved a
   significant influence of social life and literacy on the structure of
   logical reasoning. In the conclusion to this book Luria indicates, that
   his colleagues often advised him to repeat this study in 40 years, but
   the author did not considered it reasonable, as radical changes in
   cultural and educational level of Asia population must equalize the
   differences in cognitive processes with people from central regions. Is
   it so?
   Study design. A group of psychologists from Moscow, Belgorod and
   Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky performed an integrated study of endogenous
   populations of the north of Kamchatka peninsula living in regional
   centers or nomadic herdsmen in tundra. Thirty subjects (17 men and 13
   females) all with primary education in Russian schools were assessed
   using the same tests on classification and generalization, as Luria did,
   together with Luria neuropsychological battery, and projective drawing
   on life attitudes.
   Conclusion. Life values of endogenous peoples are more nature centered
   than in Russians from central regions. Nomadic and settled subgroups
   with the same level of education differed in some neuropsychological
   tests, revealing the influence of social life conditions. It confirms
   Luria's idea about cultural determination of cognitive processes but
   also shows that life conditions are as important cultural factors as
   literacy.},

Abstract = {Being neighbors, China and Central Asian states face common problems,
   which require collective response and leadership. In this article, we
   explore to what extent China's increased engagement in the region since
   the dissolution of the USSR has included attempts to lead cooperation to
   address some of these common problems. We answer our research question
   by exploring observable leadership efforts, such as institutional
   development, financial support, moral or belief supply, and unilateral
   exemplary activities. The analysis shows that in three selected issue
   areas, namely counter-terrorism, infrastructure development, and water
   management China has made certain efforts to lead, but the scope and
   character of its efforts have varied significantly between different
   issue areas and over time. This variation can be explained in the light
   of China's evolving foreign policy interests, the specificities of the
   Central Asian states, and the role of Russia as the other prominent
   external actor. While earlier China's initiatives focused on Central
   Asia and Russia, the more recent ones either include Central Asian
   states among other members or focus only on some of them. Joining
   China's projects helps Central Asian states to improve their
   international standing and diversify their foreign relations, but also
   affects regional geopolitical structure.},

   personal remittances of labour migrants and the dependence of the
   economy of Central Asian countries on these remittances was carried out.
   It is determined that the economies of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are
   30\% dependent on the remittances of labour migrants, which in the World
   Bank rating for this indicator raises them to the first positions among
   other countries of the world.},

Abstract = {The history of Islamic law in Russian Central Asia defies many of the
   categorizations offered by both global and Russian imperial history.
   Recent studies of law in the age of colonialism have concluded that the
   attainment of legal hegemony in the colonies was consequent upon the
   initiative of indigenes that strategically manipulated jurisdictions; as
   colonial subjects increasingly involved the state in their private
   conflicts, they effectively pushed their masters to consolidate the
   institutional arrangements through which the state dispensed justice.
   Historians of the Russian Empire have reached a diametrically different
   conclusion: under tsarist rule, they argue, Muslims continued to access
   the services of the native courts, which remained mostly untouched
   following Russia's southeastward expansion. As the empire promoted a
   policy of differentiated jurisprudence, Russians effectively safeguarded
   the integrity of Islamic law. I argue that both of the aforementioned
   approaches are confined to the level of institutional history, and thus
   fail to consider that the creation of colonial hegemony rested on ways
   in which colonial subjects understood law and viewed themselves as legal
   subjects. I show that Russians, from the outset of their rule in Central
   Asia, initiated Muslims into colonial forms of legality by overcoming
   the jurisdictional separation they had themselves put in place. In
   allowing the local population to file their grievances with the military
   bureaucracy, the Russians effectively pushed Central Asians to reify
   colonial notions of justice, and thereby distance themselves from the
   tradition of Islamic legal practices.},

Abstract = {Central Asia has experienced massive economic and social shocks during
   the past decade following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.
   Demand for cereals, particularly for staple cereals and meats, has
   fallen significantly even as production and productivity have plummeted.
   Although agricultural reforms were launched in 1991, the performance of
   the agricultural sector has been weak across the region. Prospects for
   food security in Central Asia appear mixed. Projections indicate that a
   growing and urbanizing population in Central Asia with rising incomes
   will increase demand for cereals by 32\% between 1995 and 2020 to reach
   24 million tons, and for meat by 47\% to reach 2.9 million tons.
   Improvements in crop productivity will be essential to meet the
   increases in demand projected for the region. Cereal production is
   forecast to keep pace with demand such that Central Asia will be
   virtually self-sufficient in cereals. However, national food
   self-sufficiency or food security does not necessarily translate into
   household or individual food security. Moreover, self-sufficiency comes
   with a high price-tag of opportunities foregone and inappropriate use
   made of resources. Given the growing enthusiasm for food
   self-sufficiency in Central Asia, it is imperative that research be
   undertaken to assess the full costs and benefits of such a policy. (C)

Journal = {ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {685-705},
Abstract = {Anthropologists estimate that 70 percent of human societies are
   patrilocal, meaning that adult sons reside with their parents, and that
   wives go to live with their husbands' families upon marriage. Yet very
   little is known about how this widespread social norm influences
   intrahousehold resource allocation and, through this, economic
   development. This paper examines the effects of patrilocality on
   schooling and household educational expenditures in Tajikistan. To
   identify the causal effect of living in a three versus two generation
   household on these outcomes, exogenous variation in housing availability
   across communities is exploited. It is shown that the impacts of living
   in a three generation household are important for both school enrolment
   and for educational spending. The results suggest that one reason why
   patrilocal societies remain poorer than those with nuclear household
   norms is that three generation households make relatively few human
   capital investments in the youngest generation. Patrilocality, which
   probably evolved to solve coordination problems in agrarian societies,
   may thus be a cause rather than simply a correlate of low educational
   attainment in developing countries.},

Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While much of the English School has focused on liberal aspects of
   solidarism, forms of ``illiberal solidarism{''} in contemporary
   international society remain underexplored. Drawing on archival material
   and elite interviews conducted in Central Asia in the period 2013-2019,
   this paper advances the claim that the Central Asian elites have
   developed the institution of authoritarianism in their region through
   the mechanisms of mimicry/emulation and praise/blame. By looking at
   specific discourses and practices over the last two decades, the paper
   discusses how the Central Asian governments have been using the new
   elements of the ``democratic transition{''} in combination with the
   traditional legitimation offered by diplomatic recognition to secure
   authoritarian regimes in the democratic age, to create authoritarian
   state-centric solidarity in the region, and to make ``avtoritet{''} and
   ``stabil'nost'{''} fundamental pillars of the Central Asian regional
   order. The paper contributes to the English School literature by
   providing an initial account of illiberal solidarism and by showing how
   authoritarianism can potentially be an institution of specific regional
   international societies; to the authoritarian diffusion literature by
   demonstrating that authoritarianism can have a deontic component
   alongside considerations of domestic survival; and to the broader norm
   diffusion literature by focusing on the spread of illiberal values.},

Abstract = {The existing historiography on liaisons between Russia and Central Asia
   in early modern period often tends to portray the cross-cultural
   diplomacy between the settings as an assemblage of sporadic,
   inefficient, clumsy encounters, full of diplomatic failures. Further to
   it, the dominant paradigm emphasizes cultural differences in the region,
   whereby any form of cross-cultural encounters was inevitably hampered by
   various confessional, religious and social borders. As a result, we tend
   to read every case of cross-cultural encounter between early modern
   Central Asia and Russia as a metaphor of cultural incommensurability. In
   the essay, I shall offer a close reading of two 17th-century Muscovite
   diplomatic missions to Central Asia as test cases with which to make
   sense of cultural encounters through the lens of individual actors. In
   doing so, I shall highlight the specific practices and strategies that
   allowed the diplomatic actors to play key roles as cultural mediators
   using their language skills, local knowledge and contact networks. In
   the broader sense, the essay set out to examine how can we problematize
   cross-cultural encounters between Central Asian principalities such as
   Khiva and Bukhara on the one hand, and Pre-Petrine Russia on the other:
   and to consider what we actually mean when we speak of early modern
   diplomacy in Central Eurasia.},

Abstract = {More money now flows into developing countries from the remittances of
   labor migrants than from official foreign aid. To make use of these
   crucial inflows, migrants rely upon transnational livelihoods strategies
   to allocate remittances. Remittance practices support individual needs
   and communal reciprocities by engaging a site of inter-household
   collaboration. While recent theories of transnational migration situate
   households prominently within these practices, ethnographic research in
   Kyrgyzstan reveals that households do not make use of remittances on
   their own. Communal practices span households by employing relations of
   debt, reciprocity, and trust. This article seeks to bridge the
   development literature focused on transnational livelihoods with an
   anthropological attunement to the social reciprocity of remittances. The
   resulting assemblages require constant upkeep while exposing social
   obligations to distortion and normative change.},

Abstract = {The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 heralded not only the creation and
   opening of borders but also the rapid entry of new actors and ideas into
   this previously isolated part of the world. This is typified by dramatic
   increases in the number of international research collaborations
   involving an ever-growing array of actors. Yet instead of pluralizing
   knowledge creation and ways of knowing, intensifying processes of
   globalization have given rise to a ``global science{''} system that has
   not flattened or significantly altered existing knowledge hierarchies,
   despite greater diversity in international research collaborations. In
   the former Soviet state of Tajikistan, this is further tempered by
   resourcing gaps, political controls, and cultural factors, offering a
   unique setting through which to explore how researchers negotiate
   international research collaborations. Centering the perspectives of
   Tajikistani researchers, the article offers new insights into the
   reframing of globally homogenizing models of international research
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that organizational justice (procedural, distributive,
   and interactional justice) has important impacts on work-related
   attitudes and behaviors, such as organizational citizenship behavior
   (OCB). In this article, we explore the extent to which individualism
   moderates the relationship between organizational justice and OCB
   (organizational obedience, participation, and loyalty) among citizens in
   Kyrgyzstan. We make additional contributions to the literature because
   we know very little about these constructs in this former Soviet Union
   country, Kyrgyzstan, an under-researched and under-represented region of
   the world. Results of our data collected from 402 managers and employees
   in Kyrgyzstan offer the following new discoveries. All three justice
   constructs are related to OCB. Individualism moderates only the
   distributive and interactive justice to OCB relationships. We develop an
   intricate theory with provocative implications: Procedural justice
   produces obedience. For ``individualists,{''} interactional justice
   inspires loyalty and, interestingly, distributive justice ``can only
   buy{''} participation, but ``can't buy{''} loyalty. Therefore, for
   individualists, interactional justice outweighs distributive justice for
   organizational loyalty. Based on Kyrgyz citizens' justice, OCB, and
   individualism, our theory reveals novel insights regarding culture,
   money attitude, and intrinsic motivation and provides critical and
   practical implications to the field of business ethics.},

Abstract = {Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, both rich in hydrocarbons, diverge in their
   attitudes toward global initiatives that promote transparency in
   extractive industries. While Azerbaijan became a champion of the
   Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the region,
   Turkmenistan declined to embrace the norm of revenue transparency. This
   paper analyzes the reasons for this outcome by evaluating the impact of
   external influences on the management of extractive industries in
   Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan since 1992. In particular, it questions the
   role of geopolitical and economic factors in making oil and gas revenues
   more transparent. The paper argues that in comparison with the
   leadership in Azerbaijan, the Turkmen elite had few incentives to
   cooperate with international organizations that promote transparency due
   to Turkmenistan's dependency on Russian and Chinese pipelines and
   limited foreign investment from Western countries.},

Abstract = {Under the authoritarian regime of Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan has achieved
   independence and stability by exploiting its natural resources through a
   strategy of ``staple globalism'' and by balancing the great powers
   against each other. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the
   new regime first distanced itself from Russia and tried regional
   alliances, then accepted help from NATO, and most recently turned
   cautiously to Russia (and China). Throughout, Uzbekistan has managed to
   receive considerable assistance from international agencies and military
   aid from several outside powers, albeit relatively little private
   foreign investment, owing to its poor business climate. The country has
   also handled potential conflicts with neighbors without significant
   violence. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Regents of

Pages = {1-34},
Abstract = {Turkmenistan has experienced increasing educational migration, and many
   of these students hope to return home after graduating. The ability of
   returned migrants to succeed in Turkmenistan's labor market is
   complicated by a variety of factors, including variation in educational
   quality across countries, intrusive state regulation of foreign
   education, and Turkmenistan's large informal sector. Based on a survey
   of 98 Turkmen citizens, this study compares the career trajectories and
   perceptions of the labor market of people educated in Turkmenistan to
   those educated elsewhere. Because men and women undertake different
   strategies of educational migration, it also compares patterns of labor
   market integration by gender. Country of education does appear to matter
   for employment in Turkmenistan, but the effect is most prominent
   immediately after graduation. Women were less likely to be employed in
   Turkmenistan, partly because they were more likely to have been educated
   abroad, and more likely to have a partner abroad.},

Title = {Meanings of Fatherhood in Urban Tajikistan},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF MEN \& MASCULINITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Research is limited on the ways in which men from post-Soviet countries,
   especially Asian Muslim men, define their paternal responsibilities and
   the factors that shape their fatherhood experiences. From February
   through August 2014, the first author conducted qualitative interviews
   with 30 fathers with children ages 0 to 19 years old who lived in urban
   areas of Tajikistan. Interviews explored fathers' perspectives about
   their childcare responsibilities, rewards, constraints, and difficulties
   of fatherhood. We clustered responses regarding respondents' childcare
   responsibilities into 4 interrelated themes: (a) teaching, (b)
   providing, (c) caregiving, and (d) nurturing. Fathers identified several
   constraints that affect their fatherhood experiences, including work and
   education responsibilities as well as the age and gender of their
   children. Overall, fathers indicated that the most difficult dimensions
   of fatherhood included responsibilities of fatherhood, finding effective
   disciplinarian approaches, and their inability to meet children's
   expectations. Most respondents commented on the joy, happiness,
   prosperity, inspiration, and support fatherhood brought to them. Results
   of this research may be useful for service providers and public health
   experts to define programs for increasing involvement of fathers in
   childcare. In addition, results may be useful to guide future fatherhood
   research, especially in post-Soviet societies.},

Title = {Reconceptualizing water management in Khorezm, Uzbekistan},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {251-268},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Khorezm region is located in the northwest of Uzbekistan,
   approximately 350 km from the current shore of the Aral Sea. It
   comprises a large-scale irrigation system that conveys water from the
   river Amu Darya to agricultural land cropped mainly with cotton, wheat,
   and rice. Khorezm's water resources are vulnerable as they depend on
   upstream developments and are indispensable to rural livelihoods and
   state budgets. Since water scarcity is expected to increase in the
   future, sustainable water management is a necessity. Hence, the
   objectives of the paper are to: (1) conceptualize the distinctive
   features of water management in Khorezm; (2) provide an integrated
   analysis of water management by establishing linkages between society,
   technical infrastructure, and the bio-physical environment; and (3) make
   policy and technology recommendations for improved water management. To
   conceptualize water management in Khorezm, the paper distinguishes three
   types of practices: formal practices, strategic practices, and
   discursive practices. Based on these, it presents an analysis of water
   management on the state water management level, the water user
   association level, and the farmer and field level. For each level,
   recommendations are given. The paper concludes that elements of
   integrated water resources management (IWRM) such as transparency,
   accountability, participation, and technical efficiency are relevant to
   improve water management in Khorezm, as elsewhere. In addition, it
   underlines the need to create legal space for agency and innovation.
   Technical tools such as models are increasingly important for
   facilitating transparency and enabling agents to access and make use of
   information across the management hierarchy.},

Abstract = {Sino-phobia, which has reportedly grown internationally during the

   providing historical and theoretical context, the authors analyse
   publicly reported time-series data from Russia and original survey data
   from Russia and Kyrgyzstan to assess the extent of Sino-phobic attitudes
   and their associations with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic
   variables. By also considering attitudes toward Americans and other
   national groups, the authors show that anti-Chinese sentiment, while
   high, does not exhibit especially pronounced tendencies. In Russia,
   nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment are key correlates of
   Sino-phobia. Additional survey research is necessary to assess the
   impact of COVID-19 on Sino-phobia and determine whether it hinders
   China-friendly policies, as some observers have suggested.},

Abstract = {Carbon-fueled acceleration of global capitalism provides the main
   framework through which the interdisciplinary formation of the energy
   humanities approaches climate crisis. This essay attends to a no less
   consequential source of power, the atom, from an intersection of spaces,
   materialities, and enunciative positions that has received little
   scholarly attention. It focuses on the Russophone Kirghiz author Chingiz
   Aitmatov's experimental hybrid of socialist realism, science fiction,
   and indigenous cosmology to explore a kind of atomic writing that
   emerged from the secret weapons development and testing sites zoned off
   on the ``naked steppe{''} at the eastern margins of the Russian and
   Soviet empires. Challenging the logic of development, progress,
   sacrifice, and disposability in both capitalist and socialist modernity,
   the situated aesthetics of Central Asia's nuclear fantastic generates a
   planetary consciousness of compound environmental catastrophe-even as it
   salvages the possibilities of a cosmopolitics for the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {The Council of the European Union adopted in June 2019 its new EU
   Strategy on Central Asia. Besides the Eastern Partnership, the
   Central-Asian region is one of the most relevant areas for the EU, so
   determining and shaping its development priorities were of paramount
   importance. In this study, based on the developments and feedbacks in
   recent months, I would like to demonstrate how the weak EU image due to
   this document will be strengthened and why it is not suitable for
   reaching the goals which are probably even not existing. My hypotheses
   are: 1) in fact, the EU does not have any clear and real strategy
   focusing on Central Asia, 2) the EU is losing out on the game of big and
   middle powers interested in the region, 3) the EU cannot exploit the
   economic potentials of the region.},

Abstract = {Researchers working in Central Asia often report difficulty obtaining
   Western-style signed informed consent statements. The principles
   underlying informed consent were developed in cultures characterized by
   low-power distance and individualism, low context communication and a
   rules basis, whereas many Central Asian cultures emphasize high-power
   distance, collectivism, high-context communication and relationships.
   Yet, consent is an important principle. We interviewed scholars who grew
   up in Central Asia, but completed graduate work in the United States,
   Canada or the UK, to ask their recommendations for developing a
   culturally appropriate consent process. The common themes that arose
   include working within a network, building relationships of trust with
   potential participants and not utilizing legal-type documentation as a
   basis for consent.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the economic conditions in central Asia at the time
   of the Russian financial crisis of August 1998, the channels by which
   the crisis was transmitted to the central Asian region, and the policy
   responses. The paper concludes that, although real exchange rates of
   central Asian national currencies vis-a-vis the Russian ruble have
   returned to their precrisis levels following the nominal devaluations
   that ensued, other indicators of external competitiveness, such as unit
   labor cost indices, suggest the need for further surveillance in this
   area. Also, it is not yet clear if full exchange rate flexibility has
   been established in central Asia despite the protracted and costly exits
   from the nominal exchange rates in place at the time of the crisis.
   Finally, the ratio of debt to GDP in central Asia, which grew rapidly
   between 1998 and 1999 in the context of large exchange rate adjustments,
   remain a challenge for the Tajik and Kyrgyz authorities, in particular.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I explore the Youth Theatre for Peace (YTP) project in
   relation to environmental aesthetics and engaged participatory practices
   towards tolerance building in Central Asia. My main argument is that
   cultural histories of storytelling, manas (an oral and now literary
   Kyrgyz epic) and trickster tales incorporate ideas and narratives that
   are useful in negotiating the ambiguities between differing moral,
   political and social agendas and can be drawn on in conflict negotiation
   contexts. I argue that environmental aesthetics offers a useful
   theoretical framework for analysing the YTP project due to the nomadic
   eco-spirituality and eco-consciousness of the region. Further, specific
   (embodied and emplaced) performing arts activities provide opportunities
   for communities to build longer-term strategies for engaging with and
   intervening in the political realities in which they live.},

   temporisation for making hard decisions defining NATO's interests in the
   region and the limit of its reach. As a result, vague commitments and
   understandings have developed between NATO and its partner states in
   Central Asia and the Caucasus, most of which are little comprehended
   even among the parties themselves, and less so by external observers

Abstract = {This paper adopts a transglossic approach to explore the ordinariness of
   English amongst Muslim communities in South and Central Asia. It thereby
   maintains that studying English as an ordinary part of these
   communities' repertoires is contingent upon an approach to religion as
   situated, discursive, and interactive. This approach to religion is key
   to avoiding a paradoxical treatment of religion and language that
   critically examines the meaning of language without interrogating
   religion in the same manner. To this end, the paper uses examples from
   ethnographic face-to-face and online fieldwork amongst Muslim
   communities in Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Bangladesh to explore and
   rethink the relationship between religion and language. The paper
   concludes that religion is co-constructed and emergent in, across, and
   through English and other languages and semiotic resources. English is
   rendered ordinary in the sense that it is employed and invoked to
   perform religious identity in interlocutors' everyday language
   practices. It is thereby used to engage in processes of positioning, and
   emerges as a resource that is simultaneously translocal and polyvocal,
   while also locally meaningful in its situated practices.},

Title = {Characteristics of industrial structure evolution and isomorphism in
   Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES},

Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {1781-1801},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study undertakes a systematic examination of characteristics of the
   spatio-temporal evolution of industrial economies in Central Asia from
   the perspectives of industrial scale, structural rationality, industrial
   competitiveness, and industrial isomorphism. The results show that
   industrial structures in Central Asian countries are becoming
   increasingly advanced, with certain differences among them in the
   characteristics of this evolution. Kazakhstan has long had a
   tertiary-secondary-primary industrial pattern, and productive services
   have played an increasingly prominent role in the development of its
   tertiary industry. The transformation of the industrial structure in
   Uzbekistan, from a secondary-tertiary- primary pattern at its
   independence from the Soviet Union to a tertiary-secondary-primary
   pattern, is apparent. Tajikistan's industrial structure has also changed
   significantly in recent times. Its secondary industries shrunk while
   tertiary industries developed rapidly. In Kyrgyzstan, the ratios of
   secondary and tertiary industries to total industrial output have
   fluctuated significantly while considerable progress has been made in
   the service sector. The industrial structure of Turkmenistan is
   significantly lower than the other countries, and Turkmenistan is the
   only country in the Central Asian region which still shows a
   tertiary-secondary-primary industrial pattern. The feasibility and
   competitiveness of the industrial structures of these five Central Asian
   countries have different characteristics. Kazakhstan has structural
   advantages but lags in competitiveness, Uzbekistan is driven by both
   structural and competitive advantages, Tajikistan enjoys structural
   advantages while Kyrgyzstan lags behind in competitiveness, and
   Turkmenistan has a competitiveness-driven economy. Furthermore, values
   of the similar coefficient index of the three industrial structures in
   these countries were mostly above 0.95, the coefficients of the
   secondary industrial subdivisions in some countries were below 0.85, and
   those of tertiary industrial subdivisions among most countries were
   above 0.89, indicating considerable similarities in industrial structure
   among them. These findings are important in the context of establishing
   an effective industrial development strategy for the Silk Road Economic
   Belt, improving international cooperation, and upgrading industrial
   structures to achieve economic prosperity.},

Abstract = {In the early stages of its transition, Turkmenistan pursued a gradualist
   path. Diversification, industrialization, and market-based reforms led
   to very rapid economic growth particularly since the late 2000s. This
   article investigates the role of Turkmenistan's economic development
   policy in diversifying industries and promoting the manufacturing
   sector. The government has diversified the destinations for the natural
   gas exports. Although its agriculture had been characterized as cotton
   monoculture, the share of wheat has risen since the 1990s. The textile
   industry has led the manufacturing sector, and other industries are not
   well developed. The government has successfully attracted foreign direct
   investment. Turkmenistan's trade policy has contributed to supplying
   machines for manufactured products, although it might have been harmful
   to the early-stage development of the manufacturing sector.
   Turkmenistan, which is not a member of the WTO, may actively utilize its
   policy space to promote technology-intensive industries and must
   strengthen its level of human capital.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {45},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1224-1251},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look to new opportunities that
   may be available to the nations comprising Central Asia. The region has
   recovered only slowly since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on secondary data from reports by
   the UN, ADB and other NGOs, academic papers and the press, a
   quasi-mathematical equation is used to illustrate how infrastructure
   development is dependant on many factors. From this analysis the
   importance of the transportation sector for future growth is discerned.
   Historical detractors are noted and drivers for the future are
   discussed.
   Findings - The paper finds that Central Asia's future growth and
   prosperity would be based on a robust redevelopment of all its
   infrastructures but primarily on the implementation of Maglev high speed
   rail systems to move freight quickly internally and for Eurasian
   transit.
   Practical implications - Well-integrated transport infrastructures
   enhance local wellbeing. The interconnectedness and interdependence of
   globalised economies depend on transport, but other aspects of the total
   infrastructure local and regional must be integrated to achieve growth.
   In the case of Central Asia it is seen that an accord between the
   Presidents is needed to ensure regional cooperation, which will lead to
   Eurasian cooperation.
   Originality/value - The region has been forgotten, to some extent, by
   the global community, yet it has great potential to become again an
   important transportation hub between Europe and Asia. The value of the
   paper is in noting the push of many NGOs towards regional integration,
   which may be best approached, we suggest, from an initial investment in
   its transportation infrastructure.},

Abstract = {This article examines impacts of infrastructure development and climate
   variability on economic outcomes for the Amu Darya Basin in Central
   Asia. It aims to identify the most economically productive mix of
   expanded reservoir storage for economic benefit sharing to occur, in
   which economic welfare of all riparians is improved. Policies examined
   include four combinations of storage infrastructure for each of two
   climate futures. An empirical optimization model is developed and
   applied to identify opportunities for improving the welfare of
   Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. The analysis 1)
   characterizes politically constrained and economically optimized
   water-use patterns for these combinations of expanded reservoir storage
   capacity, 2) describes Pareto-Improving packages of expanded storage
   capacity that could raise economic welfare for all four riparians, and
   accounts for impacts for each of two climate scenarios. Results indicate
   that a combination of targeted water storage infrastructure and
   efficient water allocation could produce outcomes for which the
   discounted net present value of benefits are favorable for each
   riparian. Results identify a framework to provide economic motivation
   for all riparians to cooperate through development of water storage
   infrastructure. Our findings illustrate the principle that development
   of water infrastructure can expand the negotiation space by which all
   communities can gain economic benefits in the face of limited water
   supply. Still, despite our optimistic findings, patient and deliberate
   negotiation will be required to transform potential improvements into
   actual gains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article aims to provide a more complete and dynamic account of the
   legal framework that underpins religious regulation in Central Asia from
   independence in 1991 through 2018, focusing on Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
   and Uzbekistan. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on a few
   key laws, high-profile events or secondary sources, our analysis
   includes the entire body of legal documents available in government
   digital legal data repositories. We find that although these three
   Central Asian states' approach to religious regulation has become more
   repressive over time, they have done so at very different paces and to
   very different degrees. While they have all increasingly restricted
   religious belief and practice that falls outside state-approved
   interpretations of Islam, the turn towards criminalization was much
   quicker and more blatant in Uzbekistan than in Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan, and has been much more absolute in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
   relative to Kyrgyzstan.},

Abstract = {This article considers how the ideas and worldviews of the first

   that the contested ideas of regionalism in Central Asia were responsible
   for the rejection, reconstruction, and diffusion of foreign norms within
   the region and beyond. The ideational norms of the Central Asian states
   are argued to play a critical role in the creation of new
   norms-multi-speed and multi-level Eurasian regionalism-and their
   diffusion into global normative processes. Thus, the Central Asian
   region, and its contribution to the development of Eurasian normative
   regionalism, deserves recognition in world politics.},

Abstract = {Information technologies can act as technical artifacts and can
   facilitate stakeholder communication, supporting decision making in a
   complex societal context. The water sector is one such example where
   limited water resources are threatened by climate change and growing
   competition for resources between sectors, regions and countries.
   Attempts to improve water governance and management through information
   technologies have been made by international, regional and national
   water agencies for the last 20 years in Central Asia. However, early
   attempts were focused on collection, systematization and analysis of the
   generic data related to the water sector in the region. There are still
   significant gaps (technical, human and financial capacities) for
   application of such technologies at the lower operational levels of
   water management, i.e. where the full dimensions of variables,
   interactions and complexities are observed and, most importantly,
   everyday politics of water are performed. The aim of this paper is to
   present practical results on improving water management in Central Asia
   through the application of better data management tools at the
   operational level across diverse institutional settings, i.e.
   transboundary, watershed levels in the region.},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {85-95},
Abstract = {The relevance of the philosophical understanding of the concept of
   ``game{''} is caused by the great interest in this phenomenon from the
   humanities and mathematical sciences (game theory). The subject of
   research is the socio-philosophical aspects of the game in the Kyrgyz
   family traditions. The purpose of the study is to conduct a historical
   and philosophical analysis of the game component within the framework of
   the specifics of the Kyrgyz ethnos. In the course of our research, we
   identified such properties of a game as non-utilitarianism,
   irrationality, the presence of rules, aesthetics, and the predominance
   of the child over the adult. We conclude that the nomadic and rhizomatic
   structure of Kyrgyz society played a decisive role in the sustainability
   of the transmission of family traditions through the game component. The
   author analyzed the game component of social matter during the main
   historical periods of the Kyrgyz ethnos and stages of psychosocial
   development. The following methods were used conceptual analysis,
   synchronic and diachronic method, comparative-historical approach,
   network methodology with elements of the post-structuralist topological
   approach.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The burial of organic carbon in lake sediments plays an important role
   in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Clarifying the current status of carbon
   burial in the lakes of Central Asia is of great significance for the
   application of carbon balance assessments. With the analysis of the
   total organic carbon and nitrogen and the carbon isotope and organic
   carbon burial rate in the core sediment of the North Aral Sea, the
   status and influencing factors of organic carbon burial over the past 70
   years can be revealed. The results showed that the main source of
   organic carbon was predominantly from lacustrine aquatic plants.
   However, the contribution of terrigenous organic carbon increased from
   the 1950s to the 1960s. The burial rate of organic carbon in North Aral
   Sea sediments was consistent with the overall change in the regional
   temperature. The burial rate of organic carbon showed an upward trend as
   a whole with an average of 28.78 g center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1).
   Since 2010, the burial rate of organic carbon has stood at the highest
   level in nearly 70 years, with an average of 55.66 g center dot
   m(-2)center dot a(-1). The protection of a lake by human beings can not
   only significantly improve the lake's aquatic ecosystem but also help to
   increase the burial rate of the lake's organic carbon.},

Abstract = {In recent years, flows of many rivers and lakes have become reduced in
   arid and semi-arid regions around the world. The most typical examples
   of this phenomenon occur in Central Asia, and the reduction of the Aral
   Sea area is closely related to agricultural water use. However, due to a
   lack of continuous data in Central Asia spanning many years, ``virtual
   water{''} is used to evaluate changes in agricultural water use. Based
   on virtual water theory, 325 kinds of agricultural products in eight
   categories are selected as the research object, and changes in virtual
   water are calculated for Central Asia from 1992 to 2016. Results
   indicate that: (1) The average annual net export of agricultural virtual
   water (TVWNE) in Central Asia is about 9 billion m(3), concentrated in
   Kazakhstan, whose annual TVWNE reaches 8.1 billion m(3). (2) Since 2007,
   the TVWNE in Central Asia has dropped significantly, with a drop rate of
   86\%, while the total volume of agricultural virtual water has gradually
   increased since 1998. (3) The upstream and downstream countries in
   Central Asia have different characteristics in the change of virtual
   water quantity.},

Abstract = {To ensure adequate oil supply and mitigate geopolitical uncertainties,
   China has diversified its sources of crude oil imports in recent years.
   Central Asia is a neighbor region of China, rich in oil and natural gas
   reserves, which can play an important role in China's strategy to reduce
   its dependence on energy supplies from the Middle East. The geopolitical
   attributes of energy and the geopolitical situation in Central Asia
   determine that Central Asia's energy development and cooperation are
   disturbed by domestic and foreign factors, and also face the risks of
   complex energy structural evolution and geopolitical games, which create
   a unique energy geopolitical pattern in Central Asia. This study
   proposes an analysis framework for energy geopolitics in Central Asia,
   arguing that the complexity of energy geopolitics in Central Asia can be
   demonstrated from the perspectives of both the main countries of energy
   development (game actors) and the whole-industry-chain of energy
   development (game themes). The most obvious feature of Central Asian
   energy geopolitics is the fierce game that is played between key
   countries and regions, Russia, the United States, China, the European
   Union (EU), Japan, India, Iran, and Turkey. Strategic geopolitical
   considerations and resource requirements necessitate the active
   participation of these players in Central Asian energy development and
   mean that the foreign policy agendas of states in this region are likely
   to become ever more crowded. Therefore, the energy cooperation between
   China and Central Asia faces the geopolitical risks of the great power
   games. It is necessary to develop reasonable and effective policies to
   establish guarantee mechanisms to minimize the risks of energy
   cooperation. This study characterizes the energy geopolitical strategies
   of Russia, the United States, China, and other related powers in Central
   Asia. It also assesses the country risks faced by energy cooperation
   between China and Central Asian countries. To withstand possible
   geopolitical and country risks, this study develops a series of policy
   frameworks which can be used to fortify the stability of the energy
   cooperation between China and Central Asian countries, and can also be
   effective in responding to the array of risks that might be encountered
   in the coming years.},

   ability to capture the complexity of social, political arid economic
   changes that Central Asia underwent in the course of seven decades
   between the October Revolution and the dissolution of the USSR. The

Abstract = {Although Central Asia emerged out of the ashes of the disintegration of
   the Soviet Union, yet the `Five Stans' (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
   Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) as a single geopolitical entity
   has emerged as new hotspot of global politics by virtue of its huge
   untapped hydrocarbon potentials and promises of new discoveries. That is
   perhaps the reason that even after the disintegration of the USSR, the
   geopolitical importance of Central Asia has never waned down, instead
   emerged as a grand chessboard for regional and extra-regional players.
   In the quest for energy security and diversity of supply sources by the
   energy consumers, the heartland region has witnessed a new great game in
   the scramble for resources to which many now call as the New Great Game
   for not just controlling but administering the energy resources of the
   region. This article examines the position of India in Central Asia and
   her policy initiatives in the epic quest for oil and energy in the
   traditional bastion of Russia and the new grand chessboard of China and
   the USA and endeavours to unearth if India at all have a foreign policy
   discourse towards the region.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Energy has become the symbol of 21st-century geopolitics. Asia in this
   geopolitical game is considered to be the ground zero. As of 2021, at
   least a quarter of the world's liquid hydrocarbons are consumed by
   China, India, Japan and South Korea. Over the next 20 years, 85\% of the
   growth in energy consumption will come from the Indo-Pacific region.
   According to the World Energy Outlook, China will account for 40\% of
   the growing consumption until 2025, after which India will emerge as the
   biggest single source of increasing demand. The increase in demand for
   gas will overtake that for oil and coal combined. Part of the story here
   is that the Indo-Pacific region will become increasingly reliant on oil
   from the Middle East and Central Asia. By 2030, 80\% of Chinese oil will
   be imported while 90\% in the case of India. But Japan and South Korea
   will remain 100\% dependent on oil imports. Where from these huge
   amounts of oil and gas will come? The scramble for oil and gas in
   Central Asia probably is the right answer to the question asked. To
   materialize the quest for oil and energy, many countries although lately
   but turned towards Central Asia for sure. With this premise, the present
   article attempts to contextualize the geopolitics of energy in Central
   Asia and tries to investigate the nature and contour of the great game
   while illustrating the unflinching importance of the region for global
   energy security in general and the Indian energy security in particular.},

Title = {Visibility of Moodle applications in Central Asia: analysis of SEO},
Journal = {UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY},
Abstract = {Search engine optimization (SEO) is an important tool that can predict
   the number of website visits, and good SEO strategies can help increase
   the visibility of educational resources. In the current article, the
   relevance between Search engine optimization (SEO) characteristics and
   the number of Moodle users in four Central Asian countries was examined.
   The analysis of learning management systems covered 38 Moodle websites.
   Analysis was conducted using semi-automated tools. Results suggested
   that although there is no difference in general SEO scores of Moodle
   installations, page structures and link structures in websites of
   different countries were dissimilar. Also, server configuration
   practices were different. In addition, there was a positive
   correspondence between the number of visits to a website and the number
   of external factors; the duration of users' visits was correlated with
   page structure. As for the normalized number of visits, the analysis
   revealed that in Kazakh universities, students use the Moodle system
   more frequently in a day than in other countries, while visits to Tajik
   universities' Moodle platforms were the lowest; the difference was 53
   users per day.},

Abstract = {This article estimates the extent and speed of exchange rate
   pass-through (ERPT) in seven Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries
   using monthly data over the January 1995-May 2020 period. The
   estimations are performed using the local projections method. We find
   that the average pass-through in the CCA is about 10\% on impact and
   about 25\% after 12 months. There is no evidence of asymmetric ERPT with
   respect to the size and the sign of exchange rate changes. The
   pass-through is broadly unchanged in fixed versus floating exchange rate
   regimes. There has been a downward shift in the speed of ERPT in the
   aftermath of the global financial crisis as CCA countries have entered a
   relatively low inflation environment. The pass-through estimates could
   be used by the CCA monetary authorities for inflation projections. The
   absence of nonlinearities in the pass-through with respect to the
   exchange rate regime suggests that transition from fixed to floating
   exchange rate regimes in the region is not likely to impose additional
   inflationary costs.},

Journal = {MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adaptation is an urgent and critical way to cope with the impact of
   climate change. The Paris Agreement has noted that adaptation is a key
   component of the global response to climate change. Nations with lower
   incomes and greater vulnerability to climate change have and will
   continue to suffer from the potential or actual impacts of climate
   change due to their limited and fragmented adaptation. Here, we consider
   Central Asia as a case study due to its increasing temperature,
   increasing rainfall variability, worsening drought, rapid institutional
   changes after independence, and uneven economic investment in
   adaptation. This paper identifies five urgent fields (including the
   theoretical basis, technology and measure, law and regulation, funding,
   and the political system) and analyzes the gap between ideal and real
   adaptation, finds the direction for future adaptation, and provides
   adaptation strategies for similar nations by using CiteSpace, which is
   based on the Web of Science Core Collection from 1990 to 2019. The
   detailed strategies present four mainstream development directions: (1)
   improve the theoretical basis of adaptation and increase investment in
   research; (2) encourage research and development into targeted
   approaches of adaptation and acquire technology transfer from developed
   countries; (3) integrate adaptation into medium- and long-term plans for
   national sustainable development, widely involving non-government
   agencies in the process; and (4) obtain financial support from
   international organizations.},

Abstract = {One of the distinguishing characteristics of the European Union's (EU)
   policy in Central Asia has been its continuity. Although the EU has
   recently revised its strategy for the region, Brussels' priorities saw
   little change both thematically and in terms of approach. This article
   argues that two mutually reinforcing factors help explain the continuity
   of the EU's Central Asia policy. First, the sui generis nature of the EU
   means the decision-making system is both complex and decentralized. The
   multitude of veto actors serves to make the status quo more realistic.
   Furthermore, the EU leadership is immune from the incentives and
   pressures of domestic political competition, an essential factor in the
   foreign policymaking of national leaders. The compounding factor is
   Central Asia's peripherality for Brussels. The region is distant
   geographically and marginal economically. As a result, continuing
   existing approaches and commitments remains the least costly and most
   feasible policy option.},

Title = {Statecraft in the Steppes: Central Asia's Relations with China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA},
Abstract = {Central Asia and China enjoy a mutually beneficial, albeit hugely
   asymmetrical, relationship. Nevertheless, leaders in Central Asia have
   occasionally and selectively resisted a broadening and deepening of
   their relations with China. Framed by a `hedging' foreign policy
   approach, this article suggests that the practice of hedging arises not
   just from structural and exogenous conditions but is also facilitated by
   domestic considerations peculiar to each Central Asian state. The claim
   here is not that leaders in Central Asia are effective or proficient
   hedgers; rather, that some are attempting to use hedging as part of
   their statecraft. The varying ability of leaders in Central Asia to
   hedge, manage, and negotiate their relations with China is often
   under-appreciated but deserves to be highlighted as an evolving
   approach.},

Abstract = {A senior American specialist on the geography of China surveys that
   country's enduring interest and involvement with the former Soviet
   republics of Central Asia, increasingly on the basis of Xinjiang's role
   as a bridgehead for economic linkages. Among the key features of this
   growing involvement reviewed in the paper are the establishment in 2001
   of a regional security alliance (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) to
   combat Islamist extremism as well as separatist activities; growing
   commercial linkages (especially with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
   Tajikistan) in tandem with improved transport links and increasing
   cross-border movements of merchants, traders, and tourists; and China's
   growing need for oil and increasing reliance on Kazakhstan as a key
   source for petroleum. China's growing engagement with Kazakhstan and
   other Central Asian countries is examined within the context of both
   opportunities as well as challenges, the latter reflecting the
   increasing complexity of Han Chinese and Uyghur/Turkic relations owing
   to increased Uyghur ties to affiliated populations in the Central Asian
   states. Journal of Economic Literature.},

Abstract = {China's involvement in Central Asia occupies an under-researched and
   emerging area of Chinese foreign policy, one which primarily revolves
   around its attempts to maintain regional stability in and around its
   periphery, strengthen its energy security in the region and maintain
   stable relations with the United States. Through its codominance with
   Russia of the nascent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), it has
   and will likely continue to find cooperation with SCO member states over
   the former two issues, but will encounter some difficulty in finding
   cooperation regarding the latter. The PRC's relations with Central Asia
   hold important short- and long-term implications for understanding the
   role of Xinjiang in China's foreign relations, China's energy security
   and its relations with the US. Furthermore, SinoCentral Asian relations
   function as a proving ground for testing the viability of China's grand
   strategy, effectively articulated by Avery Goldstein, in a specific
   foreign policy setting. Beijing's Central Asian policies reflect its
   larger geopolitical strategy, meant to ensure its peaceful rise to
   regional prominence, assuage fears of a China threat and focus on
   domestic development. This study concludes that China's relations with
   Central Asia meet vital national interests in regional stability, energy
   security and stable US-China relations, while achieving secondary
   benefits crucial to its grand strategy of a peaceful rise.},

Abstract = {Agriculture provides humanity with the most basic products to sustain
   life and raw materials for production, closely linking human society and
   nature together. The sustainable development of agriculture, an
   inevitable choice to maintain long-term social stability, steady
   economic growth, and ecological security, is the key to the coordinated
   development of the economy, society, and environment in developing
   Central Asia economies. We attempted to evaluate the trend of
   agricultural sustainability in Central Asia between 2002 and 2017 by
   adopting analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method in this
   study. It was found that the overall sustainability level of regional
   agriculture is rising, which is mainly driven by economic progress, with
   social and ecological dimensions contributing much less. Accordingly, we
   advanced four suggestions: enhancing water productivity, optimizing
   planting techniques, improving agricultural cooperatives, and promoting
   digital land management to boost the agricultural sustainability of the
   region.},

Abstract = {How far, if at all, did the intellectual legacy of early 20th-century
   Muslim reformism inform the transformative process which Islam underwent
   in Soviet Central Asia, especially after WWII? Little has been done so
   far to analyze the output of Muslim scholars ('ulama') operating under
   Soviet rule from the perspective of earlier Islamic intellectual
   traditions. The present essay addresses this problem and sheds light on
   manifestations of continuity among Islamic intellectual
   practices-mostly-puritanical-from the period immediately before the
   October Revolution to the 1950s. Such a continuity, we argue, profoundly
   informed the activity of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of
   Central Asia and Kazakhstan (SADUM) established in Tashkent in 1943 and,
   more specifically, the latter's attack against manifestations of
   religiosity deemed ``popular,{''} which were connected to the cult of
   saints. Thus, this essay posits that the juristic output of Soviet.
   `ulama' in Central Asia originates from and further develops an Islamic
   reformist thinking, which manifested itself in the region in the late
   19th- and early 20th-century. By establishing such an intellectual
   genealogy, we seek in this article to revise a historiographical
   narrative which has hitherto tended to decouple scripturalist
   sensibilities from Islamic reformism and modernism.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this article is to develop a discussion on
   folklorization or how identity is commodified and reduced to only some
   cultural traits. Currently, folklorization is one of the main devices in
   PRC's cultural and political policies in Central Asia. Authors analyze
   folklorization both inter-state with a particular focus on Kazakhstan
   and Kyrgyzstan, and intra-state, with focus on Xinjiang, based on
   empirical data collected in these countries. The discussion provided is
   about China's soft power and how it is projected to Central Asia under
   the administration of Xi Jinping. Moreover, it is concerned about
   folklorization as a political tool, utilized by the PRC government to
   mitigate tensions in the Xinjiang region, but also folklorized
   landscapes to be found also in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.},

Title = {Benefit Sharing for Solving Transboundary Commons Dilemma in Central
   Asia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-77},
Abstract = {Transboundary water governance often represents challenges specific to
   the commons dilemma. Use of water in one country affects use in another
   country, yet dynamic and diverse political and socioeconomic factors
   coupled with relatively large size of a resource system that links not
   only other sectors such as land and energy but also crosses national
   jurisdictions make it particularly challenging for interested and
   affected actors to self-organize. Central Asia represents a typical case
   of this commons dilemma, where more than 60 million people depend on
   transboundary waters shared by five independent republics that suffer
   from vicious cycle of historical rivalry and complexity. We explore
   whether and how benefit sharing, where the focus is on benefits and not
   quantities of water, can help solve the transboundary commons dilemma.
   Further, we suggest distinguishing three priorities in benefit-sharing
   solutions: economicdevelopment; egalitarian-social; and environmental.
   Investigating various configurations of prioritization, we discuss
   selected expressions of it available in the literature in general and
   from our transboundary waters case study in Central Asia in particular.
   Based on our findings we stress the importance of setting environmental
   preservation (restoration) and equitability of sharing as the joint top
   priority for benefit sharing to be sustainable in the long run, in
   contrast to a short-term perspective with prevailing
   economic-development emphasis. In the context of historical distrust
   conditions and interdependencies, we highlight the mutually important
   causal relationship between benefit sharing and trust building. For
   making the new arrangements resilient, particularly in case of
   large-scale commons, benefit sharing also requires a strong civil
   society.},

Abstract = {This article looks at Russian foreign policy in Central Asia, with a
   focus on security issues. It identifies the elements of support,
   balance, coercion, and imposition that affect relations with that
   region. Russia plays a game that, despite many difficulties, it wants to
   be a positive-sum game according to its interests in the area. By
   pursuing this analytical focus, the article questions whether the
   establishment of an enlarged security community involving Russia and the
   Central Asian states, beyond the non-functional Commonwealth of
   Independent States, could be envisaged. Russia faces a complex interplay
   of differentiated states in the area along with the involvement of
   external actors competing for influence, all of which complicate
   achievement of its interests.},

Abstract = {The fundamental fact about the religious landscape in post-Soviet
   Uzbekistan (and in post-Soviet Muslim societies in general) is the
   lasting impact of the Soviet legacy. The anti-religious campaigns of
   1927-1941 in the USSR caused massive destruction to the infrastructure
   of Islamic learning and marginalized the authority of the ulama,
   subordinating them to those of both the state and the nation to an
   extent arguably not seen anywhere else in the Muslim world. For the
   ulama after 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the task has
   been to re-establish their authority within a political field still
   dominated by Soviet-era institutional structures of state control of
   religious activity and Soviet-era discursive modes that lead to a deep
   suspicion towards religion. This article focuses on the
   ``de-Islamization{''} of the 19305 and then considers its implications
   for the ulama of today.},

Abstract = {Why and how has Tajikistan responded to the threat of democratic
   revolution? In this article, I argue that state failure and civil war in
   Tajikistan have imposed limitations on the country's emergent path of
   authoritarian development. Scarce resources and limited rent-seeking
   opportunities in postwar Tajikistan weakened the informal bases of
   presidential power and fragmented the country's state security
   institutions. As a consequence of its weakened presidential power and
   fragmented coercive capacity, Tajikistan's leadership has taken a
   moderated response to the threat of democratic revolution and pursued a
   slow, graduated strengthening of authoritarian rule. While electoral
   reforms were reversed, restrictions imposed on the media and on
   non-governmental organizations were selective and temporary and the use
   of force has been relatively circumscribed.},

Abstract = {In October 2016, the Kyrgyzstani parliament passed a new law regulating
   marriage amidst a growing debate on gender, sexuality, and the integrity
   of the Kyrgyzstani nation. The amendment, which aimed to tackle the
   already illegal practices of underage and forced marriage, criminalized
   involvement in these acts by targeting the practice that in Kyrgyzstan
   is colloquially called nitre., or what might be referred to as a
   religious or non-state registered marriage. The amendment regulated and
   recognized nitre for the first time. By adopting novel language and
   using terminology whose meaning differed significantly from common
   usage, the amendment also subtly religionized nitre. The vociferous
   public debate surrounding the passage of the bill similarly marked nitre
   as something done by the particularly pious explicitly outside of the
   state's purview, producing a spurious and politicized reading of the
   quotidian practice in Kyrgyzstan.},

Abstract = {The demographic situation of the population of Uzbekistan and the
   problems of formation of labour resources, territorial distribution and
   utilization of labour resources based on it are illuminated in the
   article. The natural movement of the population of the country today,
   and in the near future, serves as a leading factor in the effective
   implementation of the process of reproduction of labour resources.
   According to the content and essence, the re-establishment of the labour
   resources is narrower than the re-establishment of the population and it
   is reflected in the recovery of the number and quality of the
   economically active population, as well as in the recovery of mental and
   physical abilities. It has been shown that the demographic situation and
   demographic development of the regions, on the basis of scientific
   analysis, are due to the fact that the exact labour resources and the
   economically active population do not differ significantly in terms of
   age, sex and territorial composition within the Republic. Furthermore,
   attempts have also been made to reveal the use of labour resources,
   employment and its structure of sectors, the problems of employment in
   men and women and their geographical features. Changes in the population
   and its employment rate, the share of labour resources in the total
   population, employment, and labour productivity coefficients of young
   people, the situation of the economically active population and its
   dynamics over the past 20 years were analyzed and diagnosed by using
   comparison and statistical methods.},

Abstract = {Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan has
   experienced an extraordinary and devastating expansion of opiate
   trafficking and consumption. While heroin was virtually unknown in the
   country up to the mid-1990s and opium was produced and consumed locally
   only to a modest degree, in less than a decade Tajikistan has become a
   key transit country for Afghan opiates bound north- and westwards, at
   the same time as it has witnessed a rapid growth of domestic heroin use.
   Tajikistan now rivals Afghanistan for the unenviable title of the
   country most dependent on the illicit drug industry, with the opiate
   industry adding at least 30\% to the recorded gross domestic product.
   The opiate trade is so important economically that it corrupts the whole
   political system. This article therefore argues that since the mid-1990s
   Tajikistan has become a narco-state, in which leaders of the most
   powerful trafficking groups occupy high-ranking government positions and
   misuse state structures for their own illicit businesses.},

Abstract = {In the frame of this article, the authors maintained that natural
   resources and environmental conditions are the basis of material
   production and the life of the population. Systematization of the
   scientific sources on sustainable development indicated that the state
   of the environment and the quality level of resource use, protection,
   and reproduction largely determine the rates of economic growth and
   production efficiency. The relevance of this scientific problem decision
   is that at the present stage of economic development, consideration of
   the ecological and social factors when making decisions on sustainable
   development is becoming especially significant. One of the factors
   affecting social behaviors when it comes to sustainable decisions is
   awareness of the importance of sustainability. The primary purpose of
   this research is to measure sustainability awareness in Uzbekistan. A
   survey of 440 Uzbek citizens was conducted to fulfill the research aim.
   The survey results were analyzed using SmartPLS software. The paper
   presents the results of an empirical analysis, which showed that
   environmental awareness is positively and significantly connected with
   energy conservation. At the same time, the authors found that energy
   conservation is positively and significantly connected with
   sustainability issues. In line with the above findings, the obtained
   results allowed stating that sustainability issues are positively and
   significantly connected with sustainability awareness. The authors
   concluded that raising awareness among the population could positively
   effect the sustainability issues being solved in the region. The
   scientific novelty of this research could be described in the fact that,
   to the best of the authors' knowledge, no such research has been
   previously conducted.},

Title = {The future of energy in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {329-338},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Central Asia republic of Uzbekistan is well endowed with energy
   resources, yet its energy system presents some critical problems in
   terms of sustainability, security and affordability. Uzbekistan is the
   most populated country in the region, and therefore population growth,
   economic development and urbanization are likely to further strain the
   system in the future. We study some possible pathways for the Uzbek
   energy sector until 2040. We do so by creating a detailed model of the
   Uzbek energy system, and analyzing quantitatively the differential
   effect of determined policies (as compared to Business As Usual ones) in
   the transformation of the energy demand and supply sides. We find that
   even in a scenario of moderate economic growth, energy sector
   modernization can reduce the cumulative primary energy consumption by
   447 Mtoe (10.2 times the primary energy consumption of Uzbekistan in
   2010) and CO2 emissions by 1155 Mt (10.5 times the current annual CO2
   emissions). To achieve these savings, we estimate the required
   investment in the power and heat sectors at 2010\$33.6 billion, or 1.5\%
   of the country cumulative GDP (gross domestic product) between 2010 and
   2040; despite these additional investment needs, we conclude that the
   affordability of energy to households is preserved or improved. (C) 2015

Title = {Hashish as cash in a post-Soviet Kyrgyz village},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1227-1234},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: This paper discusses how hashish produced by the local
   population of Tyup, Kyrgyzstan became an important source of cash in an
   agricultural semi-subsistence economy.
   Methods: The paper is based on a research study conducted between 2009
   and 2010 that adopted a mixed-method approach to data collection. I
   gathered 64 semi-structured interviews, 147 structured interviews and
   made ethnographic observations of the livelihoods of the people of Toolu
   village in Tyup region.
   Results: The local population of the region became involved in hashish
   production due to a cash deficit in both the agricultural economy and
   wider society from the beginning of the 1990s. Privatization of land as
   a consequence of the neoliberalization of the economy left many families
   with small share lands which are insufficient to provide market surplus.
   Agricultural products, therefore, are mainly consumed by the majority of
   farmers, turning the economy of the region into a semi-subsistence
   agricultural economy. In the context of such a cash deficit economy,
   wild-growing cannabis plants are used not only as a cash crop but are
   symbolically turned into a form of cash and a source of informal credit.
   People can pay for goods with hashish as well as obtain advance payments
   and credits for it. I argue that hashish making assists the agricultural
   rural economy by allowing people to obtain goods, advance payments and
   credits to use for the cultivation of land, their everyday needs and
   maintaining social relationships. I also argue that many local farmers,
   who do not consider themselves as criminals, were able to become
   involved in this activity by shifting the meaning of hashish and hashish
   making from an illegal activity to a culturally valued and justifiable
   form of economic activity.
   Conclusion: This allows me to show that the local drug economy in Tyup
   serves as a lens through which to examine the strategies through which
   illegal and illicit drug production becomes culturally acceptable.
   Understanding of hashish production in this local context of the
   semi-subsistence agricultural economy operating in a constant deficit of
   cash provides rich data for effective evidence-based policy. (C) 2014

   impacts of rainfall shocks during the prenatal period on birth weight.
   In particular, a 0.1 log point increase in in-utero rainfall relative to
   the local norm reduces birth weight by 23.4 grams (or 0.84\%).
   Furthermore, children whose mothers are poor and live in rural areas are
   disproportionately affected. The negative impacts of fetal exposure to
   rainfall shocks could be partly attributed to prenatal care, diseases,
   and nutrient intakes. Besides, the impacts tend to concentrate in the
   first trimester of pregnancy.},

Abstract = {Why are public offices for sale in Kyrgyzstan? To address this question,
   this article attempts to set out a new logic for understanding the
   motives, nature, and consequences of corruption in the country. Rather
   than securing access to a single favor through bribery, officials invest
   in political and administrative posts in order to obtain access to
   stream of rents associated with an office. Political and administrative
   corruption is organically linked in this system, and corruption stems
   not so much from weak monitoring as from being a franchise-like
   arrangement, where officials are required to pay continuous fees to
   their bosses. The key is to be the public official influencing the
   redistribution of rents as well as participating in the informal market
   where public goods are privatized and exchanged for informal payments.
   Thus, instead of control over the pure economic assets of the state,
   influence over the state's institutional and organizational framework is
   the dominant strategy for earning and investing in the country.},

Abstract = {The Aral Sea catastrophe profoundly worsened the socio-economic,
   environmental and health conditions of the local communities in Central
   Asia. This research paper is based on quantitative approach. The three
   indicators of climate change temperature, relative humidity and
   precipitation were used to assess if climate change was one of the main
   contributors to the shrinkage of Aral Sea. The initial data were
   retrieved from Global Weather Data SWAT. The paper has analyzed the
   aforementioned indicators of climate change from January 01st, 1979 to
   July 05th, 2014 using Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling
   System model. The paper has found out that the discharge of Amu Darya
   River Basin at the inlet of Aral Sea Basin in Karakalpakstan, an
   autonomous Republic located in Uzbekistan, has sharply declined. A
   maximum peak flow happened at the inlet of Aral Sea in Karakalpakstan on
   May 25th, 1988. Since then, the inflow at the Aral Sea Basin in
   Karakalpakstan was sharply declined due to the drastic climate change in
   the region. The author believes that the outcome of the research paper
   will support policy makers of Central Asian states as well as other
   stakeholders to take measurable steps in addressing the issue of Aral
   Sea crisis.},

   evolution of the EU's goals and practices in Central Asia, contrasting
   them with China's leadership strategy, and discussing implications for
   states in the region. The EU and China have diverging approaches to
   Central Asia due to differences in foreign policy goals and domestic
   politics. Nevertheless, as of now there seems to be no rivalry between
   their projects, as neither claims sole leadership nor builds formal
   institutions with exclusive membership. The presence of two very
   different leaders is beneficial for Central Asian states as it has
   allowed them to draw more material resources, generate new ideas,
   diversify partners and balance external influence.},

Abstract = {Tajikistan is the country with the largest share of remittances to GDP
   in the world. At the same time it suffers from stubbornly high levels of
   child malnutrition against which only very slow progress has been made.
   This paper investigates the relationship between international migration
   and child malnutrition, using data from a recent nationally
   representative household survey. There are theoretical reasons to expect
   that migration may be exerting both positive and negative effects on
   nutrition and food security, so that understanding what the net effect
   may be is essentially an empirical question. Our results indicate that
   migration appears to be playing a positive role in enhancing child
   growth patterns (as measured by height-for-age z-scores) in the country.
   We explore some of the possible channels through which this effect might
   be operating and find that one such channel is by increasing households'
   kilocalorie consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to develop an optimization model for
   determining transit tariffs for energy resources, ensuring maximum
   efficiency of energy cooperation between Russia and the countries of
   Central Asia. The informational basis of the study was the statistical
   values of the indicators in the context of the countries studied for
   2010-2017: gross domestic product (GDP), exports, energy imports, CO2
   emissions, the level of transit tariffs for oil and gas. In order to
   achieve the objectives set by the method of multidimensional factor and
   integral analysis, the effectiveness of export-import relations between
   the studied countries was evaluated. The regression analysis method
   determined the elasticity coefficients of the export-import potential of
   countries and the transit tariff, with their impact on the efficiency of
   energy trade. Using a non-linear method of the generalized decreasing
   gradient, a model has been developed for calculating the optimal levels
   of transit tariffs for oil and gas, at which maximum efficiency of
   energy cooperation in the framework of export-import operations between
   Russia and Central Asia is achieved. The developed model for calculating
   the optimization of transit tariffs for hydrocarbons is based on the
   mutual reduction of their level between countries and the principle of
   equivalence. Practical application of the obtained optimal values of
   transit tariffs will ensure the intensification of export-import
   operations with hydrocarbons between countries on mutually beneficial
   economic conditions. It will be the basis for the development of
   effective strategies for the development of dense energy cooperation in
   the future.},

Abstract = {There are times when entire populations of certain countries have had to
   readjust their lives and economic strategies as all of society is under
   transition. Post-Soviet Central Asia underwent this period after 1991.
   During times of transition, there are always people that tend to be able
   to make use of the new uncertainties, even at the risk of entering legal
   grey areas. Here new social groups emerge, ethnic origin becomes
   relevant and new kinship ties are made. These transformation periods are
   often short and provide limited opportunities for analysing the
   strategies of those pioneers that I call Kairos economists. They often
   act only in cooperation with residents of the border and with duty
   customs and security personnel. This article analyses this special
   economy with the help of case studies that have been observed during the
   transformation period from the Soviet to an independent Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a computable spatial equilibrium model of Central

   Initiative on the economy of the region. The model captures
   international and subnational economic units and their connectivity to
   each other and the rest of the world. Aggregate real income gains from
   the Belt Road Initiative range from less than 2 percent of regional
   income if adjustment mechanisms take the form of conventional Armington
   and monopolistic competition, to around 3 percent if there are
   localization economies of scale and labor mobility. In the latter case,
   there are sizeable geographical variations in impact, with some areas
   developing clusters of economic activity with income increases of as
   much as 12 percent and a doubling of local populations, while other
   areas stagnate or even decline.},

Journal = {PROBLEMS OF POST-COMMUNISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Many countries have securitized their policy responses to the COVID-19
   pandemic by framing it as an existential threat demanding extraordinary
   security responses. The politics of securitization are particularly
   advantageous to nondemocratic regimes. Yet, contrary to the expectation
   that the Central Asian governments would resort to their
   tried-and-tested method of framing a new policy issue as a national
   security threat, these governments have used a deliberately constrained
   representation of the pandemic with some even diminishing the
   significance of a threat posed by COVID-19. What explains these
   unexpected patterns of securitization in response to the pandemic? This
   study argues that autocratic regimes' concerns with legitimacy and their
   specific legitimization practices shape their choices about
   securitization of a policy issue. In Kazakhstan, the government's
   response to the crisis became part of a political struggle between
   competing claims to presidential legitimacy. In Kyrgyzstan, weak
   government legitimacy rooted in poor economic performance coupled with
   the fear of unrest preempted any coherent effort to securitize the
   crisis. In Uzbekistan, the government's new technocratic self-image
   limited securitization within its COVID-19 response. In Tajikistan, a
   strategy of denial and delay emerged, since securitization of COVID-19
   promised little additional security aid.},

Title = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES IN POST-SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA: THE CASE OF BISHKEK},
Booktitle = {FROM SUSTAINABLE TO RESILIENT CITIES: GLOBAL CONCERNS AND URBAN EFFORTS},
Series = {Research in Urban Sociology},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {125-142},
Abstract = {Purpose -This chapter examines issues of sustainability in regard to
   post-Soviet Central Asian urban centers via a case study of Bishkek,
   Kyrgyzstan. This urban center of approximately one million people is the
   largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, and one of the larger cities in Central
   Asia. Dubbed ``the Tree City{''} during the Soviet Era, it, like other
   Central Asian population centers, occupies an oasis-like environment at
   the foot of a major mountain range, the Ala-Too Range of the Tian Shan
   (Mts.). This major mountain massif, which extends across the northern
   part of Central Asia and on into North-West China, has numerous peaks
   more than 4,000 m high and many glaciers. It is these snowfields that
   provide most of the water used by the city of Bishkek and its suburbs.
   Methodology - The findings represented herein are based on ethnographic
   field observations and interviews conducted in 2006-2007 and 2013-2014.
   A variety of documentary resources were accessed as well.
   Research findings - During Soviet times, Bishkek and its environs were
   the location of industrial complexes focused on the processing of
   minerals and agricultural produce, much of which was shipped to other
   republics within the USSR. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many
   of these industrial sites have fallen into disuse and disrepair. So,
   while Bishkek has numerous ``socialist{''} planned parks,
   long-established green spaces, and a relatively large ``urban forest{''}
   along major boulevards and thoroughfares, it is also dotted with
   abandoned factories, warehouses, and crumbling infrastructure. In parts
   of the city, and especially around its perimeter, urban fruit and
   vegetable gardens have reappeared, as many residents had to return to
   subsistence gardening to provide basic food needs for their households.
   In the last decade, however, the local economy has begun to diversify
   and grow. This has brought more cars to the streets and a substantial
   number of new businesses and building projects, along with increasing
   amounts of air, water, and noise pollution. Concomitant with this new
   development has been the emergence of a nascent green movement, the
   establishment of environmental organizations, and a small but growing
   ``green consciousness{''} as witnessed by the creation of new recycling
   programs, increased bicycle travel, and related activities pointing
   toward a more sustainable future.
   Implications - In this chapter, the relative sustainability (social,
   cultural, economic, and ecological) of this Central Asian urban center
   are considered as it has emerged from its Soviet past to become the
   focal point of new enterprises, including a small but growing ecotourism
   industry. Bishkek, in common with other major cities of this region,
   which is far from the moderating influences of the sea, must adapt to
   the realities of what are likely to be increasingly severe climate
   change impacts - increased average annual temperatures, the rapid
   retreat of mountain glaciers and a reduction in the essential waters
   that they provide, and increasingly severe and numerous periods of
   drought. Whether or not Bishkek can successfully adapt to these changes
   and emerge as a more sustainable city remains to be seen.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Limited data on the pollution status of spatially extensive water
   systems constrain health-risk assessments at basin-scales. Using a
   recipient measurement approach in a terminal water body, we show that
   agricultural and industrial pollutants in groundwater-surface water
   systems of the Aral Sea Drainage Basin (covering the main part of
   Central Asia) yield cumulative health hazards above guideline values in
   downstream surface waters, due to high concentrations of copper,
   arsenic, nitrite, and to certain extent dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
   (DDT). Considering these high-impact contaminants, we furthermore
   perform trend analyses of their upstream spatial-temporal distribution,
   investigating dominant large-scale spreading mechanisms. The ratio
   between parent DDT and its degradation products showed that discharges
   into or depositions onto surface waters are likely to be recent or
   ongoing. In river water, copper concentrations peak during the spring
   season, after thawing and snow melt. High spatial variability of arsenic
   concentrations in river water could reflect its local presence in the
   top soil of nearby agricultural fields. Overall, groundwaters were
   associated with much higher health risks than surface waters. Health
   risks can therefore increase considerably, if the downstream population
   must switch to groundwater-based drinking water supplies during surface
   water shortage. Arid regions are generally vulnerable to this problem
   due to ongoing irrigation expansion and climate changes. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Central Asia has been generally omitted from most academic debates,
   including those on the causes and consequences of widespread plagiarism
   and copy-and-paste behaviour among journalists. In this article I
   address this problem by interviewing working journalists from
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The article argues
   that plagiarism in journalism is not only thriving but also encouraged
   by a variety of mechanisms, such as the distribution of
   ``ready-to-publish{''} media content by government press secretaries and
   encouragement for journalists to simply ``add your name{''} to these
   materials. It finds that some journalists are proud of the fact that
   others plagiarise their work, saying ``it indicates we are doing a
   superior job{''}, which in turn encourages further copyright breaches
   within the profession. This is significant, because students and early
   career journalists may witness such practices and conclude that
   plagiarism is a norm and that is how it should be, thus creating a false
   ``model of excellence{''} for future journalists and the public. The
   results are also discussed in relation to agenda-setting theory, whereby
   governments predominantly control media outlets. In such a context, the
   public may end up only having access to news that is subsidised and
   approved by their governments.},

Abstract = {Analysts have frequently discussed ``cadre rotation{''} in post-Soviet
   Kazakhstan, or the tendency of President Nusaltan Nazarbayev to transfer
   high-level personnel across regions. Some see it as an element of clan
   politics, while others consider it to be an element of center-periphery
   politics. Nearly everyone agrees, though, that it is a mechanism of
   authoritarian rule. Here I argue that cadre rotation has a deeper logic
   and is tied more to state formation than to regime politics. After
   describing cadre rotation in historical context, I offer a comparative
   analysis of its implementation in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan since 1991
   to highlight divergent processes and outcomes of state formation.},

Abstract = {This paper quantitatively analyzes the utilization efficiency of
   agricultural resources in Central Asia by calculating the consumption
   coefficient of the main resources, including arable land, water and
   fertilizers. The results of these investigations reveal the following:
   (1) The average consumption coefficients of cultivated land resources in
   Central Asia are much higher than the world average value of up to 7.74
   m(2)/kg, which is 3.6 times that of China, suggesting that the
   cultivated land resource consumption coefficient of cultivated land
   resource utilization efficiency is low in the Central Asian region. (2)
   Up to 80\% of available water Central Asia is about 9.43 m(3)/kg, or
   nearly 9.3 times the average value elsewhere in Asia, indicating that
   agricultural water use efficiency in this region is very low and water
   resources are wasted. (3) The fertilizer consumption coefficient in
   Central Asia is 0.035 kg/kg, which is close to the world average, but
   the utilization efficiency of fertilizer is relatively high. Therefore,
   in the future development of agriculture, Central Asia should pay more
   attention to the management of agricultural water resources in order to
   improve the utilization efficiency of these resources as well as that of
   arable land.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian conflict management (ACM), conceptualised by Lewis et al.
   (2018), is an analytical framework aimed at understanding how
   authoritarian regimes respond to violent domestic challenges in ways
   that reject liberal conflict resolution practices that have emerged
   since the 1990s. Operationally, the authors define ACM as having three
   pillars: discursive control, spatial control and authoritarian political
   economic practices. Quantitative methods have not yet been broadly
   applied to ACM. This study quantitatively examines violent intrastate
   conflict in the Middle East and Central Asia to test several assumptions
   undergirding ACM, namely ACM's prevalence over time and impact on
   governments' ability to garner external support in domestic conflicts. I
   find that regimes in these regions deployed full ACM in fewer than half
   of cases, and the prevalence of ACM has not increased over time.
   Discursive and spatial control practices were employed more frequently
   than authoritarian political economic interventions. Finally, regimes
   that deployed full ACM were more likely than regimes that did not to
   have received external authoritarian support; no such difference was
   observed vis-a-vis support from external non-authoritarian countries.},

Abstract = {Although there is now a large body of literature on poverty in the
   countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, there remains a dearth of
   comparative analysis of child poverty and wellbeing. This article uses
   household survey microdata for the period 2001-2003 to compare absolute
   poverty, relative poverty, material deprivation and participation in
   schooling among children in five countries: Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova,
   Russia and Tajikistan. The analysis shows that low absolute levels of
   household consumption are associated with other deprivation indicators
   and with children's participation in schooling. The article also
   highlights the usefulness of relative poverty measures that effectively
   identify children at risk of exclusion in even the poorest countries in
   the region. The article concludes by arguing that household consumption
   is a good indicator of child poverty and deprivation in the region, and
   that relative poverty measures should be more widely used in monitoring
   global targets for poverty reduction.},

Abstract = {The industrialized countries had unfavorable natural circumstances in
   comparison with Asia. But, as Europe had a preference for Indian
   commodities, it tried to find ways to import-substitute them. As a
   result, Europe created science and technology, constructed the
   transatlantic trade system and import-substituted Indian printed cotton.
   As Russia also tried to import-substitute ``red{''} printed cotton from
   Central Asian, it achieved its early industrialization. Thus, it can be
   concluded that when a certain national ongoing appreciation or
   preference persists for a long time (in this case, three centuries),
   even if circumstances are unfavorable, obstacles can eventually be
   overcome and the object in question obtained, even if indirectly. In the
   case of Russia, their preference for ``red{''} printed cotton from
   Central Asia promoted the modern cotton industry.},

Abstract = {Mountains have been an intergovernmental and transnational issue of
   growing importance for 15 years. Thanks to global conferences such as
   the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 and regional
   treaties such as the Alpine Convention (1991), it is easier and
   increasingly useful for local communities to connect across borders.
   This growing will and capacity to be associated with intergovernmental
   initiatives is the result of a general trend in public affairs to bring
   together different stakeholders at various levels. However, the
   `'voice{''} of mountain people sometimes remains outside debates and
   decision-making processes related to mountain development. The present
   article focuses on the emergence of a mountain community network in
   Central Asia. It addresses the issue of local governance and the
   international networking process to strengthen the `'voice{''} of
   mountain people.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork as well as collaborative events with
   artists and policy makers in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, I demonstrate
   how water concepts and forms of interaction are anchored in the
   particular water incarnations of springs, lakes, glaciers and big
   rivers. As main water arteries for the Aral Sea, the Naryn and Syr Darya
   Rivers are managed between shifting alliances of the farming interests,
   International Non-governmental Organisation (INGO) bodies and national
   agencies of four riparian states. These Central Asian rivers have been
   subject to big dam-building programmes since the mid-Soviet period,
   while international companies now mine on the glaciers of the Naryn
   headwaters. I analyse socionatural water relations on a spectrum of
   three `incarnations': first, river water as an exploitable resource;
   second, enspirited springs and lakes; and third, glaciers as indexes of
   human wrongdoing. While the multiplicity of water relations has been
   documented in many parts of the world, the concept of water incarnations
   highlights their topographical anchoring. This Central Asian case
   further shows how this anchoring can support claims of national
   entitlement. Finally, this paper argues that the situated heterogeneity
   of water relations can make it difficult to connect them to more
   sustainable water relationships in the region.},

Title = {Critical Post-Functionalism in the Architecture of Late Soviet Central
   Asia},
Journal = {ABE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Number = {13},
Abstract = {Relying on all but forgotten texts of architectural criticism from late
   Soviet Central Asia, the article explores the discursive strategies
   employed by architects, critics, and historians to justify the shift
   away from the rigid functionalism of the 1960s to the regionally
   sensitive architecture of the 1970s and the 1980s. Soviet architects and
   critics, alert to the Soviet government's insistence on the primordial
   continuity of regional and ethnic architectural traditions, and to the
   need to incorporate them into the new socialist style of Central Asian
   architecture, used the ideological quest for national forms as a means
   of expressing their growing distrust of prefabricated functionalism and
   their opposition to a Central Asian version of the Stalinist style. This
   architectural criticism essentially shielded late Soviet architecture
   from ideological dogma, allowing for its impressive formal flexibility.
   By critically exploring two scholastic distinctions, first between the
   national form and the socialist content (or essence), and second between
   the national and the international in socialist architecture, this
   article reconstructs the unique intellectual conditions governing the
   architectural profession in the USSR where architects operated in a
   context characterized by the impossibility of private commissions, the
   quest for aesthetic objectivity, the rise of historic preservation, and
   the gradual transformation of controlled socialist nation-building into
   the violent nationalism of the 1990s.},

Abstract = {A bibliometric analysis was performed in this work to evaluate the
   research publications on Central Asia from 1990 to 2014 based on Science
   Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index databases. This study
   presented a comprehensive overview of the field from the aspects of
   major journals, subject categories, outstanding keywords, leading
   countries, institutions and authors, as well as the research
   collaborations. It was identified that a total of 11,025 papers were
   published in 2356 journals and there had been a steady development over
   the past 25 years for Central Asia research. Geosciences
   Multidisciplinary, Geochemistry and Geophysics, Paleontology,
   Environmental Sciences and Zoology were the most popular subject
   categories. Keywords analysis indicated that ``Tien Shan{''}, ``climate
   change{''}, ``taxonomy{''}, ``new taxa{''}, and ``health care{''} were
   the topics that generated the most interest and concern. Besides,
   temporal evolution of keywords revealed the rapid growth of ``Central
   Asia Orogenic Belt{''} and ``Zircon UPb dating{''}. According to
   research forces analysis, USA and Russian Academy of Sciences came as
   the leading contributors and had the dominant position in collaboration
   networks. This paper was a new attempt to better the understanding of
   the progress in Central Asia research. The findings of this study would
   help researchers improve the performance.},

Abstract = {Greater deployment of non-hydropower renewable energy sources in Central
   Asia appears to be a rational solution to energy security in the region.
   However, renewable energy diffusion in Central Asia is at an incipient
   stage. Moreover, the utilization of renewable energy sources varies
   substantially across the region. Whereas fossil fuel-rich, more
   developed Central Asian economies pursue the deployment of
   non-hydropower renewable energy sources, water-rich, lower-income
   countries retain their reliance on large-scale hydropower. This article
   argues that wider deployment of non-hydropower renewable energy sources
   is critical for Central Asian countries' sustainability and attempts to
   explain the double paradox of plenty through the specifics of
   institutional environments in energy-poor and rent-dependent Central
   Asian economies.},

Title = {Portrait Under Construction: Lotte Jacobi in Soviet Russia and Central
   Asia{*}},
Journal = {OCTOBER},
Year = {2020},
Number = {173},
Pages = {65-117},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Traveling in Russia and Central Asia in 1932-33, the German-Jewish
   portrait photographer Lotte Jacobi produced an extraordinary archive of
   several thousand photographs documenting Soviet industrialization,
   collectivization, modernization, and, most profoundly, the revolution's
   human face. Yet she never assembled a photo book or other reflection
   about her experience. Based on a study of the archive in its entirety,
   this essay tells the story of Jacobi's journey through the lens of her
   photographs, building a portrait of the worlds in which she moved under
   the auspices of the Soviet photo agency Soiuzfoto. It discusses her
   portrayal of a diverse array of workers, collective farmers, peasants,
   street traders, intellectuals, and political figures, first in Moscow
   and Michurinsk and then in the newly established socialist republics of
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where she was hosted by leading indigenous
   communists such as Abdurahim Hojiboyev and Fayzulla Xo'jayev. The essay
   theorizes some of the key problems that her corpus raises: the relative
   weight of political commitment and external control in its production;
   whether it operates in a realist or mythic mode; the extent to which it
   presents Soviet Russia's role in Central Asia as that of a modernizing
   state or colonizing empire, as its tsarist predecessor had been; and the
   critical status of what she called ``types{''} with respect to the
   nineteenth-century racist ``type{''} photograph. A coda considers
   Jacobi's belated return to her Soviet corpus for the first time in the
   late 1950s and early `60s, a period characterized by a post-Stalinist
   thaw and the nominal end of the Red Scare in the United States, to which
   she had emigrated in 1935 in the wake of Hitler's appointment as
   chancellor and Germany's subsequent transformation into a one-party
   dictatorship.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {5-20},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {With a decrease in formal trade barriers, trade facilitation has come
   into prominence as a policy tool for promoting trade. In this paper, we
   use a gravity model to examine the relationship between bilateral trade
   flows and trade facilitation. We also estimate the gains in trade
   derived from improvements in trade facilitation for the Central Asian
   countries. Trade facilitation is measured through the World Bank's
   Logistic Performance Index (LPI). Our results show that there have been
   significant gains in trade as a result of improving trade facilitation
   in the Central Asian countries. These gains in trade vary from 28
   percent in the case of Azerbaijan to as much as 63 percent in the case
   of Tajikistan. Furthermore, intraregional trade has increased by 100
   percent. Among the different components of the LPI, we find that the
   greatest increase in total trade comes from improvement in
   infrastructure, followed by logistics and efficiency of customs and
   other border agencies.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-336},
Abstract = {Accession to the European Union (EU) constitutes one of Turkey's primary
   foreign policy objectives. However, to establish whether the country
   would benefit from becoming part of an integrated Europe, its foreign
   policy alternatives to EU membership must also be examined. The first
   part of this article analyses Turkey's changing relations with Europe.
   Against this backdrop, the article then moves to assess Turkey's
   partnership with the USA and the potential of maintaining a close
   relationship independent from Europe. The role of Russia, Turkey's old
   neighbours and relations with the Turkic states, as well as the
   potential for attaining a leading role among them, are also considered.
   The argument is that Turkey may exploit its geostrategic position to
   pursue its core foreign policy interests and even assume an important
   regional role. However, Ankara ought to concentrate on what has long
   been its priority - full Turkish membership of the EU.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1263-1287},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {NGOs and neocolonialism are among the key concerns of postcolonial
   theorists, but their representation in postcolonial literature has
   received surprisingly little attention. This article examines the
   representation of NGOs and their impact on ``developing{''} societies in
   postcolonial literature, specifically in two post-Soviet Russophone
   novels - Kazakhstani author Lilya Kalaus's The Fund of Last Hope: A
   Post-Colonial Novel (2013) and Tajik author Eleonora Kasymova's Tajik
   (2007). My analysis bridges research in literary studies and social
   sciences by complementing studies ``from above{''} of the post-Soviet
   transition, and is intended to reveal how postcolonial societies,
   especially women, adopt, adapt, or resist the norms promoted by their
   countries' NGOs. I argue that rather than taking a side or remaining
   passive objects in the power games of their nations, women writers use
   their personal insights into the workings of post-Soviet NGOs to expose
   the neocolonial tendencies in the agendas of each political player.
   Echoing Achille Mbembe's notion of ``mockery from within{''}, the
   authors satirise how local NGOs' dependency on the West, and their
   inability to divorce themselves from Soviet influences, lead to their
   self-orientalising, contradictory and inefficient practices. Moreover,
   they reveal the complicity between foreign neocolonial forces, local
   corrupt elites and their subjects. Thus, Kalaus and Kasymova blur the
   oppressor/oppressed binaries and problematise the stereotypical
   anti-western critiques of NGOs in their countries. Furthermore, they
   point to the specificities of the Soviet colonial project and how its
   legacies are played out in the post-Soviet context. Much as the
   competing interests from Russia and the West, Soviet legacies,
   especially internalised Soviet Orientalism, exacerbate class divisions
   among women and lead to the depoliticisation of gender activism. By
   focusing on the understudied post-Soviet cultures through a postcolonial
   lens, the article widens our understanding of global neocolonial
   processes and their representation in literature more broadly.},

   covering 57 countries over the period of 1995-2010, we find no evidence
   of FDI spill-over effects on innovations, when corruption is
   endogenously modelled in the regression. Interestingly, we find that
   corruption and expenditure on education sector are positively related to
   the number of patents applications, suggesting anti-corruption programs
   encourage innovations that promote economic growth. Our study shed light
   on the national innovations and anti-corruption programs.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a sociologically informed understanding of what
   influences the lives and life-choices of people living in Kazakhstan and
   Kyrgyzstan (Central Asian Republics) and Armenia and Georgia (the
   Caucasus), four of the successor states of the Soviet Union that
   suffered significant social and economic changes following the collapse
   of the Union in 1991. The focus is on the nature of these societies for
   their citizens; ultimately we are concerned to understand what makes a
   society liveable for all, what type of society enables people to be
   generally satisfied with their lives. To do this we use the Social
   Quality model to derive indicators from which to model what makes for a
   liveable or at least tolerable society. The model is validated by
   reference to subjective satisfaction-how people feel about life in
   general-as the ultimate outcome indicator of individual well-being. The
   data we use were collected as part of a broader study of living
   conditions, lifestyles and health in eight of the successor states of
   the Soviet Union, the Confederation of Independent States (CIS).},

   in comparative market settings by reporting on a high-stakes ultimatum
   game and revelation game experiments in two transition economies:
   Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. While controlling for cultural differences
   and framing effects, we find statistically significant differences in
   fairness and honesty behavior between the two countries. Specifically,
   subjects in Uzbekistan (in an earlier stage of transition to a market
   economy) are fairer and more honest than their later-stage Kazakh
   counterparts. Our experimental findings have implications for the

Title = {Institutional aspects of water management in Central Asia - Water users

Journal = {WATER INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The way water resources in the former Soviet Union (FSU) were managed in
   the second half of the past century had both positive and negative
   effects and contributed to the existing situation. On the one hand,
   extensive development of water resources led to the transformation of
   millions of hectares of virgin lands into agricultural production,
   providing millions of people with food and livelihoods. On the other
   hand, the over-exploitation of water resources led to drastic changes of
   the environment: many water bodies, such as lakes, small rivers, and
   delta wetlands dried up. The Aral Sea basin is one of the dramatic
   examples of the negative impacts of large-scale irrigation
   interventions. The state-controlled era of development in the Soviet
   period has a legacy of standardized procedures and rules formulated at
   the top. The shortcomings of such a water management included
   fragmentation, duplication, and a highly administrative approach without
   considering the needs of the environment and input of water users into
   planning, allocating, and managing of water resources. This paper
   presents an analytical view of the role and importance of water users
   organizations/associations (WUOs/WUAs) in the irrigated agriculture and
   under irrigation management transfer (IMT) in Central Asia region,
   International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Scientific
   Information Center of Interstate Coordination Water Commission (SIC
   ICWC) conducted the ``Best Practices.{''} Projects including activities
   covered Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins of Central Asia. During the first
   stage of the project (01.04.1002-31.03.2002), the monitoring objects
   were: 30 district water management organizations (DWMO), eight WUAs, 58
   collective farms (CCF), and 61 private farms (PPF) from eight provinces
   Central Asia) project for conserving water resources by involving water
   users into water savings. The primary strategy was to propagate
   application of inexpensive technical and managerial methods and measures
   to save water by users themselves. The project is a joint project of
   IWMI and SIC ICWC aimed to monitor and disseminate the best practices of
   water conservation initiated by water users. The first year of the
   ``Best Practices{''} project accomplished a broader involvement of water
   users into the water conserving methods, therefore continuing the
   beneficial good water management practices. It also continued to involve
   the water supplying organizations and various groups of water users
   (collective farms, farmers, and water users' associations). The major
   interest was to analyze the impacts of the different water conservation
   and management practices on productivity of water use.},

Abstract = {A large part of the Central Asian region is located within the inner
   flow of the Aral Sea basin. The water resources are formed from renewed
   superficial and underground waters of natural origin, and also with
   returnable waters. The intensive increase of water intake, that took
   place in the second half of the twentieth century caused practically
   complete assimilation of the river inflow. That was the main reason for
   the Aral Sea crisis. On the basis of the analysis of long periodical
   rows of observation by meteorological and hydrological stations, the
   estimation of regional water resources and calculations of changes of
   some components of the hydrological cycle due to the expected climate
   changes are presented. Measures for adaptation in the southern part of
   the Aral Sea region are considered.},

Journal = {IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Number = {S1},
Pages = {79-85},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of donors in addressing a complex set of
   water-related challenges in Central Asia and draws some lessons with a
   view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of development
   assistance in the region.
   In the first years following independence, collaboration between the
   republics was strongly supported by development agencies under the
   leadership of the World Bank. This effort was marked by the
   establishment of the Interstate Fund of saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and
   the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (SIC ICWC) in Central
   Asia, preparation and signing of interstate agreements in 1993 and 1994,
   as well as development of a regional water strategy.
   Despite significant donor contribution, the last several years have also
   demonstrated weaknesses in donors' activities in the region, which is
   especially discouraging, given the increased tensions over competing
   uses of water for hydropower upstream and irrigation and ecosystem
   demands downstream. Among the main weaknesses are:
   lack of sound coordination;
   avoidable involvement of international experts and ignorance of local
   capacity;
   cut in support of regional water-related projects.
   Given the above, donors should rethink their development assistance
   policies in the region in order to encourage more active interaction
   between the countries for the benefit of people and the environment.

Abstract = {Women political participation is understood to be a part of civic rights
   but their participation is hindered by various factors. Numerous
   researchers have claimed that Islam as a religion, Muslim social culture
   and tradition inhibit women from political participation in Muslim
   societies. However, there are a number of Muslim majority countries
   where women occupy the highest public offices and head ministries. How
   can this contradiction be explained. This article examines women
   political participation in Central Asian Muslim republics by looking at
   socioeconomic, parliamentary representation and informal participation
   factors. The study argues that socioeconomic factors in the republics
   still do not allow much liberal public space for women to take part in
   politics; however, in terms of parliamentary representation the
   republics maintains a record that sometimes are better off than many
   mature democracies. In terms of informal participation the region
   records better visibility of women in politics.},

   trade was alleged to be a major motivating factor in the Russian

   little-studied and little-understood. In this article I will argue,
   first, that the region's slave trade was characterized by decentralized
   trade networks and by abundant inter-nomadic trade; and, second, that
   Russian efforts to end the slave trade by decree and through military
   force in the 1860s and 70s were not as successful as has often been
   assumed.},

Abstract = {Energy is the most abundant and valuable natural resource of Central
   Asia and northwest China(1) and includes oil, gas, coal, electricity,
   and renewables. Kazakhstan has large reserves of oil and coal.
   Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have significant reserves of gas. Kyrgyzstan
   produces significant amounts of hydroelectric power. Xinjiang, China has
   significant coal resources and an uncertain, although generally
   promising, potential for oil in the Tarim basin. These energy reserves
   form the basis for future economic growth and development in the region,
   and energy exports are beginning to generate important foreign exchange
   revenues. Although Central Asia enjoys vast energy development
   potential, there are obstacles to exploiting these resources, including
   limited infrastructure for transporting energy-notably oil and gas
   pipelines and electric transmission lines-in the region, political
   turmoil, payment difficulties, and inadequate energy policies. Despite
   these challenges, however, with appropriate government planning Central
   Asia is poised to become a significant world supplier of energy,
   especially in the oil and gas sectors, and the region is likely to
   diminish OPEC's influence of the global oil market over the long term.

Abstract = {In developing countries, the magnitude as well as the composition of
   foreign capital greatly influences the political fortunes of domestic
   actors, and thus regime trajectory. This paper demonstrates that the
   states of Central Asia and the Caucasus depend heavily on external
   capital flows for the financing of their fiscal deficits and that the
   bulk of the flows go directly to authoritarian governments. This
   situation has empowered authoritarian rulers, provided very little
   financial strength to local businesses, and offered half-hearted
   incentives for market reforms. Moreover, the small differences among
   these states in terms of the composition of capital flows also explain
   why some of these states have moved towards a milder version of
   authoritarian rule while others have been stuck in hard
   authoritarianism. (c) 2005 The Regents of the University of California.

Journal = {ETHNOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-159},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Within the past century, international tourists have increasingly sought
   exotic destinations in their pursuit of relaxation, escape, and
   adventure. Recognizing the opportunity to earn valuable foreign
   currency, developing countries have catered to these desires by
   encouraging tourism development. The interplay between ``hosts{''} and
   ``guests{''} and the impact of tourism on host communities have been
   recurring themes in the anthropological literature on tourism, but
   scholars recognize that these categories have several limitations. The
   terms gloss over the wide variation that exists in the tourist
   experience for both guests and hosts, and ignore the important actors
   known as mediators. This article examines the role of mediators in two
   post-Soviet Central Asia states: Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Mediators
   there are particularly important because neither country is well known
   in Western countries, and neither country inherited a well-developed
   tourist infrastructure from the Soviet state. These mediators are
   cultivating a positive image of Central Asia as a new tourist
   destination, developing tourist accommodations, and lobbying government
   institutions to support and regulate tourism. However, the industry is
   rife with conflict and competition.},

Abstract = {Vulnerability to earthquake disasters in mountainous regions frequently
   escapes investigation and analysis. The tragic and costly earthquake
   disasters that have recently occurred in Central Asia have spurred
   important questions among local, regional, and international
   policymakers, scientists, and social activists regarding the root causes
   of earthquake vulnerability. Drawing on an analysis of recent earthquake
   disasters in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, this
   article explores the concept of ``seismic culture{''} (Degg and Homan
   2005) in relation to vulnerability. Specifically, it argues that
   diminishing levels of indigenous hazard knowledge, demographic shifts,
   gendered livelihood transformations, and the lack of public access to
   science-based earthquake information have contributed to overall low
   levels of seismic cultures of prevention in the region. A major finding
   of the study points to the particular role of women in helping to
   redress the erosion of seismic culture, thereby bolstering local
   resilience, earthquake preparedness, and disaster risk reduction.},

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the analysis of the main stages of the
   emergence and development of contacts, as well as of the active
   interaction of the nations of Afghanistan and Central Asia (CA), from
   antiquity to the present. Due to its geographical position, complicated
   internal political situation and ethno-confessional mosaic, Afghanistan
   and the Central Asian states for a long time have been in the area of
   close attention of both global and regional powers. The relevance of the
   selected topic is due to the call to strengthen the CIS southern borders
   and create a culture of mutual neighborly co-operation, which is one of
   the priority tasks not only of the states of Central Asia, but also of
   Russia and China As the most important factor that can largely determine
   the future, the commonwealth of the historical destinies of Afghanistan
   and Central Asia is pointed out, with respect to the fact that
   representatives of ethnoses residing on both sides of the Panj and Amu
   Darya rivers has been interconnected for many centuries-and most of them
   are related. It is emphasized, that in the ancient period and the Middle
   Ages Afghanistan ties with Central Asia (including Kazakhstan and East
   Turkestan) had comprehensive and systematic character; thus, material
   culture, beliefs and customs-all formed, albeit peculiar, but in many
   respects similar or even identical complexes. A comparison of the
   archaeological, anthropological and historical-ethnographic materials of
   these regions suggests that already in the early antiquity they were
   pooled by the same model of the economy and general ethno-linguistic,
   cultural and historical traditions. Economic and cultural recovery, both
   of Afghanistan and Central Asia, from antiquity and the Middle Ages,
   until the XV century (the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries)
   were promoted by the routes of the Great Silk Road. It is concluded that
   through research and analysis of contacts and experience of interaction
   of various nations inhabiting the center of the Eurasian continent one
   can look at the deep roots of historical processes and find solutions to
   various contemporary problems taking into account the historical past.},

   characterized by confrontation, power politics, balance of power and
   coercion. Yet, spheres of influence still constitute part of the
   present-day political vocabulary, and several regional dynamics are in
   fact framed and analysed by using this concept. Are spheres of influence
   returning, or have they simply evolved? How do spheres of influence look
   like in contemporary international relations? With a specific focus on
   Russia and Central Asia, this article adopts an English School approach
   to the study of spheres of influence and offers a conceptualization of
   contemporary spheres of influence as structures of negotiated hegemony
   between the influencer' and the influenced' where norms and rules of
   coexistence are debated, contested and compromised on. The implications
   of this are multiple. First, the approach allows for seeing spheres of
   influence as social structures where norms and rules of coexistence are
   in play. Second, it allows for an analysis of the implementation and the
   legitimacy of spheres of influence through history. Third, by stressing
   the evolutionary character of spheres of influence, it puts the notion
   of their return' into question.},

Abstract = {With China continuing to make economic forays into Central Asia,
   attention has simultaneously turned to Russia's privileged position in
   the region. A cursory glance through many articles concerned with the
   `Russia - Central Asia - China' dynamic provides a misleading impression
   that Beijing's strengthened ties with the countries of Central Asia are
   coming at the expense of Moscow's influence. This paper will show that
   events, conventionally characterized as breakthroughs in the `China -
   Central Asia' relationship in the last four to five years, are in fact
   part and parcel of larger economic trends that began long before the
   inking of the energy and trade deals. The reality of China's growing
   economic influence in Central Asia is not disputed. What this paper will
   argue is that despite the heralded dislodging of Russia by China, Russia
   will continue to play a substantial role in the region through a
   combination of energy, culture, and military bonds that run much too
   deep for Beijing to sever in the short to medium term.},

Abstract = {The water climate-food security nexus is uniquely vulnerable in Central
   Asia, a region replete with transboundary water conflicts, shortages in
   land and water resources and high sensitivity to climate change. Using a
   water balance for the Amu Darya River Basin, we present a synthetic
   evaluation of future water use, crop yields, land and water
   productivities for the period 2016 to 2055 in Ahal, Dashoguz, Lebap, and
   Mary provinces in Turkmenistan. Modeled fut socio-economic scenarios
   include food security and diet change (FSD), export-oriented sustainable
   adaptation (ESA) and business as usual (BAU). Results show that water
   requirements and water deficits during growing seasons will exhibit a
   decreasing trend from 2016 to 2055 in most provinces under all three
   scenarios. Crop yields and land and water productivities will likely
   increase in the four provinces under both the FSD and ESA scenarios.
   Mary province had the highest mean income and losses of irrigated
   agriculture, with an annual average value of about 7 x 10(8) USD/year
   and 1.5 x 10(3) USD/year, respectively. Ahral province showed the
   largest annual mean land and irrigation water productivities for all
   three scenarios, up to about 800 USD/ha/year and 0.40 USD/m(3)/year
   respectively. Results obtained from this study provide tools to assist
   resource managers to identify vulnerabilities in the nexus of water,
   land and climate to ensure food security, water management, and
   sustainable development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this article Laura Adams examines cultural change in Uzbekistan
   through the evolution of European-style theater during the twentieth
   century. The adoption of this theatrical form was part of a broader
   project of cultural modernization undertaken first by the Jadids and
   then by the Soviets. It was also an example of a colonial hierarchy of
   cultures, which deemed European forms to be more advanced than
   indigenous ones. In spite of a pervasive discourse about the renewal of
   national culture, however, European-style theater continues to be
   strongly supported in Uzbekistan today. Adams argues that both
   modernization and colonialism contributed to an internationalist
   orientation among Uzbekistan's cultural elites. This orientation makes
   an investment in indigenous cultural forms less desirable, since they
   are only intelligible on a local level. European-style theater, however,
   enhances the value of national culture both by marking its modernity and
   by communicating national content in an internationally understood and
   valued medium.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the historical interaction between colonizer
   and colonized influenced gender inequality in the Central Asian state of
   Uzbekistan. The study demonstrates that the interaction had cultural and
   structural components that contributed to the establishment of gender
   conservatism as a national virtue. After the failure of other
   initiatives in the region, the Soviets launched a massive unveiling
   ritual in Uzbekistan that led to widespread resistance, including a wave
   of murders of unveiled women. At the same time, the Soviets left in
   place local patriarchal networks that reinforced this gender
   conservatism. To underscore the critical nature of these interactions
   and their variability, the study includes evidence from neighboring
   Kazakhstan, a nomadic society where women did not veil and where local
   networks were disrupted through Soviet-led collectivization and
   sedentarization. The study argues that these two societies interacted
   differently with the Soviet modernizing project, with implications for
   present-day disparities in gender equality.},

Title = {Household allocation of microfinance credit in Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-98},
Abstract = {The limited endowment of resources that usually characterised low-income
   households imposes a binding trade-off between current and future
   consumption. In many transition countries, microfinance represents the
   primary source of credit other than informal moneylenders for low-income
   households which is the situation in the Kyrgyz Republic. Thus, this
   study analyses the determinants of household microfinance credit
   allocation in Kyrgyzstan from 2006 to 2010. We model the household's
   behaviour through a multivariate approach to allow for multiple choices
   at the same time. Results indicate that mobile phone and livestock
   ownership were identified as two key factors which increase the
   probability of borrowers using microfinance credit for productive
   purposes. Furthermore, borrowers in the rural Naryn region, one of the
   poorest areas in Kyrgyzstan, have a higher probability of allocating
   their loans toward food purchases and the smallest probability of
   allocating credit toward starting a business or other productive
   purposes.},

Title = {Engaging with Labour Migrants: Emigration Policy in Tajikistan},

Abstract = {Tajikistan is one of the main migrant origin countries in the
   post-Soviet world, with about one million labour migrants living and
   working in Russia. It is also one of the world's most
   remittance-dependent economies. By exploring how and why the Tajik
   government has engaged with labour migrants since 1991, this article
   analyses the development of emigration policy in Tajikistan. In doing
   so, the article de-reifies the state and illustrates the complexity of
   policy processes: many actors are directly and indirectly involved in
   policymaking and implementation. Four aspects are analysed: shifts in
   emigration policymaking over time and the influence of different
   domestic actors; the assistance offered to labour migrants; the impact
   of Russia as the main host country; and the influence of international
   organisations in the context of the nascent global governance of
   migration. This article argues that Tajikistan's emigration policy has
   gradually moved from a laissez-faire phase, through a proactive, then a
   ``messy{''}, to a reactive one. It shows that Tajik authorities have
   followed often contradictory pathways of (non)involvement with labour
   migrants and thereby illustrates how declared policies can be
   distinguished from informal practices performed by the state.},

Abstract = {This article studies sigma- and beta-convergence across the regions of
   Kazakhstan over the period of 1993-2014. The results of the article show
   that incomes across the regions of Kazakhstan diverged over the whole
   period of 1993-2014 and the period of 1993-2006, and converged during
   the period of 2006-2014. However, after controlling for the rate of
   investment and population growth it is evident that regional convergence
   occurred over the whole period of 1993-2014. This would suggest that
   since private investment in Kazakhstan is heavily influenced by the
   availability of natural resources in the regions, regional policy in
   Kazakhstan should be directed towards shifting away from a
   resource-based growth model to an alternative growth model.},

Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {546-562},

Abstract = {A study of myth, cult, and language as tools of state power, this paper
   analyzes ways national identity was constructed and articulated in one
   state. When Turkmenistan became independent in 1991 its first president,
   Saparmyrat Nyyazow, promoted himself as the savior' of the nation by
   reconceptualising what it meant to be Turkmen. Myth, public texts and
   language policy were used to construct this identity. While they were
   the targets of the state's cultural products, Turkmen citizens
   contributed to the processes of cultural production. Nyyazow legitimised
   his authoritarian leadership, first by co-opting Turkmen citizens to
   support his regime, and then by coercing them as participants in his
   personality cult. The paper concludes that Nyyazow used the production
   of culture, invented tradition' in Hobsbawm's sense, to bolster his
   agenda and further his own power. It also argues that the exaggerated
   cult of personality Nyyazow cultivated limited his achievements, rather
   than solidifying them.},

Abstract = {To make on object transparent implies that its internal features become
   better visible. It also means that the surface of that same object
   becomes less discernable. I apply this analogy to argue that the current
   preoccupation with transparency allows certain ideological movements to
   hide controversial agendas from public scrutiny. Focusing on evangelical
   Christian aid to Kyrgyzstan, this article traces how post-Soviet
   liberalization enabled evangelicals to gain a strong footing in this
   Muslim-majority society. Their emphasis on religious rights served to
   legitimize their missionary agendas, while the adoption of development
   rhetoric allowed evangelicals to present themselves as ``transparent{''}
   civil society players. As such, this empirical case illuminates the
   ideological workings of ``empty{''} and ostensibly value-free political
   imageries.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Soviet policy toward genealogically defined
   identity groups in the Central Asian republic of Turkmenistan. For
   Soviet authorities, kinship loyalties were problematic chiefly because
   they hindered the emergence of class consciousness among the Turkmen.
   Soviet officials pursued two essentially contradictory policies in their
   attempt to eliminate ``tribalism{''} in the Turkmen republic. First,
   they sought to undermine the economic basis of genealogical affiliation
   by dismantling the existing system of collective land tenure. Second,
   they devised a policy of ``tribal parity,{''} which attempted to
   suppress kin-based conflict by guaranteeing fair and equal treatment for
   all genealogical groups. Instead of allowing class consciousness to
   supplant kinship loyalties, however, Soviet rule tended to increase the
   salience of distinctions based on genealogy. Because of the close
   linkage between genealogy and socioeconomic standing in Turkmenistan,
   Soviet attempts to foment class conflict inadvertently exacerbated
   descent group conflict.},

Pages = {137-159},
Abstract = {Counter-extremism has become an important tool for the authoritarian
   government of Tajikistan to consolidate its position. In this article,
   we argue that counter-extremism is not purely about destructive acts,
   such as banning groups or arresting individuals: it is productive, too.
   Using a Foucauldian understanding of disciplinary power and biopower, we
   argue that counter-extremism in Tajikistan is an attempt to produce
   secular, docile citizen subjects who are resistant to extremist ideas.
   Using ethnography and discourse analysis, we focus on the way in which
   these practices are gendered, targeting the bodies of those deemed
   `dangerous'. Counter-extremism, we argue, is exercised not only by the
   state but also by citizens, who monitor themselves and others for signs
   of radicalization. Although some support state secularism, most merely
   accept it. A smaller group resist practices that target certain forms of
   religious belief and practice. We explore these everyday forms of
   resistance against disciplinary power and biopower.},

Abstract = {Using post-Soviet Kazakhstan as a conceptual point of departure, this
   article considers the role that proactive framing and persuasion play in
   ensuring regime survival in soft authoritarian contexts. Drawing on
   interviews, opinion polls, news media, and the scholarly literature, the
   authors use three examples-Kazakhstan's OSCE bid, the global financial
   crisis, and ``Rakhatgate{''}-that highlight the regime's varying
   proportions of persuasive and coercive efforts. The ways a soft
   authoritarian leader responds to potentially threatening events are
   examined. Non-material sources of regime durability are analyzed as
   essentials for understanding authoritarian regime dynamics and, by
   implication, for developing a full theory of regime change.},

Title = {The feminization of agriculture in post-Soviet Tajikistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {128-139},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper we aim to analyse economic and social transition factors
   affecting the agricultural labor force and to understand the
   feminization phenomenon in rural Tajikistan. Agrarian reforms, seasonal
   male labor out migration, and the subsequent increase in women's labor
   participation have facilitated changes in gender occupational
   segregation. We assume that in post-Soviet transition countries such as
   Tajikistan, the process of feminization grew from the need to take on
   jobs and to to slip in the role of the breadwinner due to the absence of
   men. The process enabled women to gain knowledge and experience in new
   employment positions.
   We contribute to the knowledge on feminization by conducting
   qualitative, case based analysis through in-depth interviews and focus
   group discussions and present unique data on previously unobserved
   employment categories and their characteristics from the Sughd province
   of Tajikistan.
   Results suggest that existing local systems of power and male-dominated
   relationships are being challenged due to male labor force outmigration,
   leading to a feminization of the remaining labor force and recipient
   clients. The jobs women perform remain subject to low protection,
   security, and earnings. However, increased participation in the labor
   force provides a gateway to a wider spectrum of labor opportunities and
   advances women's roles in primary agricultural production as well as in
   the service supply sector, and provides them a certain amount of control
   over their own lives.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {499-518},
Abstract = {Contributing to the growing literature on feminist geopolitics, this
   article addresses the security discourses employed by the Karimov regime
   in Uzbekistan's post-independence nation-building process. It examines
   the ways in which militarism and the `culture of war' are productive of
   gendered national identities in Uzbekistan, focusing on how the
   `protector-protected' relationship figures prominently in the Karimov
   regime's anti-terrorist rhetoric. It does so through a textual analysis
   of the Andijon uprising and the `Day of Memory and Honor' holiday. It
   argues that the terrorist threat has been a driving factor in the
   pervasive militarization of society, but that official responses to
   state violence in Andijon obscure alternative security concerns of the
   general population in Uzbekistan and more specifically those of women.
   It adds to existing feminist geopolitics literature by expanding it into
   a new empirical context, while rejecting the assertion that a
   `geopolitical' analysis necessarily entails a `global' approach.},

   transition experience in an English Medium Instruction (EMI) environment
   through the Multiple and Multi-dimensional Transitions (MMT) theoretical
   lens. Data were collected from a small purposive sample of students
   through semi-structured interviews. The findings of the study reveal
   that the students experienced transitions in the academic,
   psychological, and social domains of their life. The academic
   transitions were in the form of gaining linguistic competencies, the
   psychological transitions were toward changing the students' outlook and
   their image of self, and the social transitions were toward a
   readjustment of the students' role in their family and community. Thus,
   these mostly positive and multi-directional transitions were
   developmental and transformational in nature},

Abstract = {The article has been written in order to disclose the development
   potential of agricultural cooperation in the Kyrgyz Republic in the
   conditions of its integration into the unified food market of Eurasian

   national and global food value chains. Upon examination of works
   revealing the potential of cooperation in the development of value
   chains, analysis of the agrarian structure and evaluation of the
   potential held by member states for cooperation, the authors of the
   article have proposed measures for comprehensive development of
   agricultural cooperation in the Kyrgyz Republic. The article is based on
   the materials by international organizations, the National Committee of
   Statistics of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Eurasian Economic Commission and
   results of research conducted by separate authors. The article's
   materials can be used to generalize the international practice of
   studying the role of cooperation in the development of food value chains

Title = {Electricity demand in Kazakhstan},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {35},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3729-3743},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Properties of electricity demand in transition economies have not been
   sufficiently well researched mostly due to data limitations. However,
   information on the properties of electricity demand is necessary for
   policy makers to evaluate effects of price changes on different
   consumers and obtain demand forecasts for capacity planning. This study
   estimates Kazakhstan's aggregate demand for electricity as well as
   electricity demand in the industrial, service, and residential sectors
   using regional data. Firstly, our results show that price elasticity of
   demand in all sectors is low. This fact suggests that there is
   considerable room for price increases necessary to finance generation
   and distribution system upgrading. Secondly, we find that income
   elasticity of demand in the aggregate and all sectoral models is less
   than unity. Of the three sectors, electricity demand in the residential
   sector has the lowest income elasticity. This result indicates that
   policy initiatives to secure affordability of electricity consumption to
   lower income residential consumers may be required. Finally, our
   forecast shows that electricity demand may grow at either 3\% or 5\% per
   year depending on rates of economic growth and government policy
   regarding price increases and promotion of efficiency. We find that
   planned supply increases would be sufficient to cover growing demand
   only if real electricity prices start to increase toward long-run
   cost-recovery levels and policy measures are implemented to maintain the
   current high growth of electricity efficiency. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Constrained contraceptive choice: IUD prevalence in Uzbekistan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {50-57},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {CONTEXT. Because individuals' and couples' needs vary, the availability
   of a variety of contraceptive choices is a key component of successful
   family planning programs. Most women in Uzbekistan rely on a single
   contraceptive method (the IUD), but it is unclear whether this reflects
   constraints on choice or simply a widespread preference.
   METHODS: Nationally representative data from the 1996 Uzbekistan
   Demographic and Health Survey and the 2002 Uzbekistan Health Examination
   Survey were used to evaluate the relationship between demographic
   characteristics and knowledge and use of contraceptives among sexually
   active women. Separate multivariate regression analyses were performed
   for 1996 and 2002.
   RESULTS: Nearly all sexually active women knew about contraceptives, and
   in 2002 most reported that they had ever used the IUD (71\%) or any
   modern method (77\%). In both surveys, women with higher levels of
   wealth (odds ratios, 2.2-3.1) and education (1.9-2.5) were more likely
   than other women to know about contraceptive methods other than the IUD.
   Higher levels of wealth and education, as well as urban residence and
   non-Uzbek ethnicity, were also associated with the use of contraceptives
   other than the IUD, although these relationships were generally weaker
   in 2002 than in 1996.
   CONCLUSION. Despite the high prevalence of contraceptive use in
   Uzbekistan, the country's reproductive health program may be
   constraining method choice. Expanded programmatic efforts emphasizing
   choice from a range of methods are needed, especially among subgroups of
   women who have little knowledge or experience with methods other than
   the IUD.},

Abstract = {Leadership is critical for the viability of rural groups. The way in
   which leadership is legitimised can mediate leader and group member
   behaviour in the face of social dilemmas. Yet there has been scant
   research on leader-follower dynamics in naturally occurring groups.
   Highlighting the case of agricultural machinery circles in Tajikistan,
   the effect of leading by example on investments to a collective good is
   studied in a framed field experiment. To increase realism, and contrary
   to standard economic experiments, this investment is a voucher allowing
   the group to make a real-world machinery purchase at reduced costs. Two
   treatments manipulate leaders' legitimisation. Elected leaders achieve
   30 per cent higher contributions to the collective investment against a
   baseline version without a leader. Contributions remain, on average,
   relatively stable over the course of the game. The results are discussed
   with reference to the debate on external intervention in agricultural
   producer organisations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE},

Volume = {15},

Pages = {S127-S144},
Abstract = {When Mukadas Kadirova changed her mode of dress as an act of religious
   devotion, she and her family - the self-proclaimed (former) epitome of
   modern, Soviet citizenry - were confronted with conflicting normative
   systems. Was Mukadas still a modern woman? Was the family? And what was
   modernity anyway, they asked: socialist ideals, capitalist consumption,
   or pious women fashionably tying their headscarves? This paper, based on
   fourteen months of fieldwork in Kyrgyzstan, examines Mukadas's religious
   transformation; her attempts to map this alteration onto the shifting
   discursive and material realities of the post-Soviet period; and her
   play with variant notions of modernity. Mukadas's struggle ultimately
   shows that while modernity is often characterized by a linear,
   forward-looking gaze, experiences of modernity are not always marked by
   this progressive `onward' sense. Modernity can be simultaneously past,
   present, and future.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept, criteria
   and definitions of quality of higher education from the perspectives of
   the leadership of three new independent accreditation agencies in
   Kyrgyzstan. Design/methodology/approach The author employed
   interpretative qualitative research design. The data for this study were
   collected through semi-structured interviews with the leadership of
   three independent accreditation agencies and through review and the
   qualitative analyses of new policies on accreditation of higher
   education institutions, new accreditation standards and criteria. A
   priori codes by using categories were defined in advance and emergent
   codes based on data driven were used for data analyses. Findings The
   research findings support the author's argument that the new independent
   accreditation processes will not assure quality because first, the
   agencies are not independent of the Ministry of Education and Science;
   second, the current standards do not provide evidence of quality; and
   third, the institutions do not have what in Europe is called a ``quality
   culture{''} - ongoing, continuous efforts toward quality.
   Originality/value This is first scholarly work looking at independent
   accreditation process at its beginning stage. The results of an article
   can have influence on further development of accreditation system and
   improvement of accreditation standards.},

Abstract = {Individual-level migration responses to economic fluctuations and
   political instability remain poorly understood. Using nationally
   representative survey data from Kyrgyzstan, we look at variations in
   levels and propensities of internal and temporary international
   migration and relate them to changes in the economic and political
   environment in that Central Asian nation in the first decade of the
   century. A multinomial event history model predicting yearly risks of
   both types of migration detects no clear association of internal
   migration risks with episodes of heightened political instability but
   shows a decrease in those risks in response to the strongest economic
   shock of the observation period. In comparison, international migration
   risks, while also insensitive to political turmoil, appear to increase
   at the time of the most pronounced economic downturn. The results also
   point to instructive patterns in migration propensities by type of area
   of residence, education, gender, and ethnicity. These findings are
   interpreted in light of complex intersections of demography with
   politics, economy, and culture in this transitional Eurasian setting.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the reproductive behavior of young women and
   men in the post-Soviet Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan, focusing on
   the link between migration and fertility. We employ event-history
   techniques to retrospective data from the `Marriage, Fertility, and
   Migration' survey conducted in Northern Kyrgyzstan in 2005 to study
   patterns in first-time parenthood. We demonstrate the extent to which
   internal migration is related to family formation and to the patterns of
   becoming a parent after resettlement. We gain deeper insights into
   demographic behavior by considering information on factors such as the
   geographical destination of migration and retrospectively stated motives
   for reported moves. In addition, our study reveals clear ethno-cultural
   differences in the timing of entry into parenthood in Kyrgyzstan.},

   impose a financial burden on households, which is alarming for the
   authorities, who see the ritual economy as a threat of the citizens'
   impoverishment. The reputation of families and the desire to confirm
   social status in the eyes of relatives, neighbors and friends doom
   households to conspicuous extravagance. This article uses empirical
   evidence collected through interviews with the residents of Central
   Asian countries in 2021-2022. The ritual economy in the countries of
   Central Asia is a vivid example of social pressure on the financial
   behavior of families. Spending during the performance of rituals is a
   kind of self-presentation of households. A significant part of the
   inhabitants of the Central Asian region is not able to bear the burden
   of expenses associated with the performance of rituals without
   borrowing. Even despite the fact that, for example, for weddings they
   begin to prepare much in advance. However, own savings, as a rule, are
   not sufficient. The way out is a formal or informal loan. The article
   describes how debt obligations are organized under a formal agreement
   with a bank loan or informal borrowing from friends and relatives, and
   what drives household choice. The expansion of bank lending is driven by
   two reasons. The first is the attractiveness of bank loans due to the
   fact that they are not personalized and do not imply a feeling of
   personal gratitude to those who lend money. The second reason is the
   growth in defaults on loans from relatives and friends, which causes a
   reduction in the practice of using social networks as sources of
   lending. Non-payments of loans indicate a reduction in the ability of
   the social environment to control the behavior of its members.},

Abstract = {This paper looks into the role of policy-making carried out by various
   government officials in the Japanese financial community who contributed
   to the formulation and implementation of Japanese ``Silk Road
   Diplomacy{''} in the 1990s and woos. Furthermore, it examines the role
   of key Japanese ministries in the overall Japanese geopolitical
   engagement in Central Asia. When the five Central Asian republics of the
   USSR became independent in 1991, they soon encountered a proactive
   engagement of Japanese diplomacy toward them. Besides boosting bilateral
   assistance and economic ties, official Tokyo has vigorously promoted the
   Central Asian states' eligibility in many international financial
   institutions and provided extensive advice on reform policies. Both
   Japanese and Central Asian officials shared a preference for gradualism
   in economic reforms as a popular approach alternative to the Western
   neoliberalism in Central Asian countries, although the extent of
   embracing gradualism varied upon individual republics and advising
   officials. Spurred by the failures of the Washington consensus and
   financial crises of the 1990s, Central Asian gradualism can be regarded
   as an early precursor attempt at post-neoliberalism.},

   Belonging in Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BORDERLANDS STUDIES},
Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of reconsidering the meaning of the
   nationhood within artificially created borders in Central Asia in both
   theoretical and regional settings. This paper argues that there is a
   dichotomy in the images used to describe CA regional relations and
   nationhood in the IR discipline that either extensively relies on
   arguments along the lines of rivalry, domination, and spheres of
   influence or, alternatively, attempts to go beyond rationalist rhetoric
   by focusing on local understandings of various concepts and termswith
   little, dialog between these two theoretical camps. This paper
   emphasizes the way neighborhood in Central Asia is tightly integrated
   into the nationhood construction through the notions of
   brotherhood/fraternity (birodarlik/kardoshlik/baurlastyk) and of the
   shared norms of endurance (sabr) and informal collective decision-making
   (maslahat) for nationhood and region building. Unpacking these meanings
   contributes to the task of creating a more diverse and inclusive IR
   discipline reflective of various regional specificities.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on regional integration through the lenses of the
   Water-Food-Energy (WEF) nexus, a concept putting strong emphasis on
   cross-sectoral and multi-level interactions as well as on resource
   interdependencies. There is an extensive amount of published research
   focusing on the Aral Sea basin. In this paper, the authors build upon
   these different contributions and provide a meta-analysis of the
   literature of WEF nexus opportunities in Central Asia (CA) countries.
   This paper contributes to ongoing discussions regarding how the WEF
   Nexus can represent an opportunity for reinforced collaboration
   regarding resources management. To do so, focusing on existing
   literature, this paper first (1) explores how the nexus can be a
   relevant instrument for regional integration. Second (2), it provides an
   overview of water, food, energy conditions and challenges in the Aral
   Sea basin in particular. Third (3), synthesizing existing research, the
   authors identify critical variables to be considered as hurdles or
   leverage points for WEF nexus implementation in the Aral Sea basin.
   Finally (4), we go back to our initial set of questions and identify
   some possible avenues for future research.},

Title = {Comparing at What Scale? The Challenge for Comparative Urbanism in
   Central Asia},
Booktitle = {EMERGING URBAN SPACES: A PLANETARY PERSPECTIVE},
Series = {Urban Book Series},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {109-127},
Abstract = {Can research on cities in a specific region contribute to comparative
   urban literature? This chapter focuses on the intersections between
   comparative urbanism and the academic investigation of Central Asian
   cities. I argue that the inherited structures of scholarly activities
   and a lack of financing have created an epistemological predicament
   within the region; as a result, Central Asian cities have been
   addressed, if at all, primarily by scholars based in the West. Their
   limited and isolated findings have not yet found their way into a larger
   debate on comparative urbanism. This article is, therefore, an attempt
   to reflect on the ` state of art' when it comes to Central Asian
   urbanism. In the past 20 years, comparative work in urban studies has
   produced interesting and valuable insights into the potential synergies
   between postcolonial, political-economic and cultural/post-structural
   analyses. Comparative urbanism, while emphasising the multiple
   trajectories out of which different cities are forged, prompts us to
   look beyond enduring bounded entities and outdated epistemologies by
   focusing on different cities. Jennifer Robinson, for example lists `
   post-socialist cities' among ` divisive categories' and suggests that we
   ` move beyond' such categories and the hierarchies which they imply.
   These inspiring thoughts, however, clash with the conventions of the
   publishing industry and the priorities of academic existence. In
   scholarly literature and in teaching, various geographical boundaries
   persist, leading to the ` lumping' of cities into regions. The challenge
   remains for comparative work in urban studies to become more grounded in
   the disarray of geographic scales and historical periods. Accordingly,
   from a Central Asian perspective, this chapter explores the potential
   for a regionally oriented analysis to offer new insights into the
   methodology and conceptualisation of comparison.},

Abstract = {China's relationship with Central Asia has grown manifold since the
   foundation of Shanghai Five in 1996, which in June 2001 became the
   Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. The impetus to the relationship has
   further been accentuated when China-Russia friendship treaty was signed
   in July 2001. The US-led war in Afghanistan against Taliban and Al-Qaeda
   has yet again cemented Chinese position in Central Asia, and the
   recently concluded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has undeniably
   dramatically underscored the strategic value of Central Asia to the west
   and has opened up possibilities for Chinese security, political and
   economic interests. Geostrategically enmeshed with Central Asia, China
   will remain an integral and increasingly influential player in Central
   Asia. This research paper contextualises China's emergence and interests
   in Central Asia discarding the much talked about great game thesis and
   asserts by analysing the rise of China in the region as an unmatched and
   unchallenged power which has been testified once again with the recent
   BRI of Beijing.},

Abstract = {Objectives. Using the example of Uzbekistan, this article examines the
   challenges and opportunities for conducting field research in a context
   of tightened scientific closure in those countries with highly
   autocratic regimes. Methods. Drawing on the author's own field
   experience conducting elite interviews in Uzbekistan in 2002 and 2003
   (as well as many subsequent visits), it examines three strategies of
   field research that emerged in this context of tightening scientific
   closure. Results. The article outlines several essential features of
   authoritarianism in Uzbekistan and tracks the regime's shift toward
   scientific closure over three distinct phases, tracing out the
   implications of this shift for those carrying out systematic field
   research. Conclusions. Uzbekistan illustrates the challenges and
   opportunities facing researchers under conditions of scientific closure
   in the 20-30 other countries ruled by hard authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explore the relationship between tourism, renewable
   energy and CO2 emissions in Europe and Central Asia countries over the
   period 1990-2015. Using two-step GMM estimator, we find that tourism has
   positive effect on CO2 emissions, while renewable energy reduces carbon
   emissions. For example, when renewable electricity production increases
   by 10 percentage points, CO2 per capita emissions decrease by 4.1\%. Our
   results also suggest that GDP per capita has inverted U-shaped
   relationship with environmental degradation in ECA region, confirming
   existence of Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) phenomena in this region.},

Abstract = {This essay examines hydraulic engineers in Central Asia under tsarist
   rule and their participation in processes of agricultural expansion and
   empire-building in the imperial province of Turkestan. This province
   theoretically provided the perfect space in which Russians, who
   continually worried about their own ``backwardness{''} in relation to
   Europe, could demonstrate their ability to be a colonial power on par
   with European empires, yet the lack of an understanding of irrigation
   engineering and the difficulties of irrigating arid regions threatened
   to jeopardize Russia's efforts at a ``civilizing mission.{''} Still, a
   growing group of Russian technical specialists was able to participate
   in scientific dialogue and transnational technological exchanges with
   other hydraulic engineers in other parts of the world who were similarly
   enthusiastic about the potential of science and technology to create a
   more modern future in the Russian Central Asian borderlands. Ultimately,
   however, even though the zeal of these Russian and foreign hydraulic
   experts coincided with Russian political ambitions in Turkestan, the
   political realities of the tsarist government's position in the region
   would determine the fate of their grand visions for transformation.},

   that Central Asian states tend to be integrated with other countries of

   the Central Asian states had in terms of regional integration has been
   rapidly disappearing over recent decades. While currently Russia and the
   former Soviet Union outperform China as the key economic partners for
   Central Asia, there is a clear trend towards an increase in economic
   links to China. Finally, we find that Central Asian states are
   pro-active in creating new economic links in Eurasia: the role of
   Kazakhstan, in particular, should be noted from this perspective.},

Abstract = {The vast majority of Central Asians consider Islam to be part of their
   social identity - as it has been for centuries. Yet seventy years of
   official Soviet atheism decimated Islamic institutions of learning,
   leaving both imams and die population largely unfamiliar with
   traditional Islamic teachings. There is now a struggle within the five
   formerly Soviet republics of Central Asia between Islamists and
   governments to reconstruct an Islam and to capture die allegiance of the
   populace. Central Asia is not now engaged in a clash of its Islamic
   civilization with a Christian West or an Orthodox North - and far less a
   Confucian East. Rather, it is struggling to construct its own Islamic
   identity (or identities) on the foundation of a glorious ancient past, a
   harsh recent past, and a bleak economic and political future. This paper
   discusses the different aspects of religion in Central Asia (including
   Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, Sufism, Shi'ism, ``popular Islam,{''}
   and Islamism), and describes political efforts to control (or
   ``manage{''}) religion - particularly die ``Islamist threat.{''} Such
   governmental efforts, however, appear to be exacerbating the wry
   Islamist threat that they seek to contain.},

Abstract = {Central Asian (international) politics has traditionally been understood
   as if domination were the core aim of local actors, and that they apply
   any sort of means (such as obtaining rent or coercion) to achieve that
   end. The persistence of that conception subsequently reproduces the
   ``spirit{''} of the New Great Game. By spirit, I mean a way of
   interpreting regional events that rests on practices akin to a Great
   Game-such as competition and a struggle for power-without fully
   subscribing to the analogy. The essay then assesses a distinctive and
   increasingly important way of understanding Central Asian politics based

Abstract = {The countries of Central Asia have a perilous nuclear legacy inherited
   from the Soviet Union. Using survey data from Aktau and Nur-Sultan,
   Kazakhstan, a generalised ordered logit model is used to analyse
   relationships between people's attitudes, location, and demographic
   characteristics and their support towards construction of NPPs. Results
   suggest there is complex association between historical proximity and
   support for NPPs. Furthermore, the general public can be separated into
   two groups: (1) those who oppose nuclear power and (2) those that have
   become complacent towards future risks. Perceived risk to human safety,
   radiation, and environmental damage are found to be associated with
   higher levels of opposition to the building of an NPP, whereas
   importance of job creation is found to be associated with higher levels
   of support for an NPP. These results are important as they indicate a
   need to promote public engagement prior to constructing an NPP.},

Journal = {COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2010},

Number = {3},
Pages = {327-344},
Abstract = {Private tutoring has become increasingly visible in Eastern Europe and
   Central Asia since the collapse of the socialist bloc in the early
   1990s. Yet, this unprecedented growth of private tutoring, in its varied
   forms and arrangements, has remained largely unnoticed by policymakers
   in the region. Based on the data from the cross-national studies of
   private tutoring in 12 countries, this explorative study examines
   factors driving the demand for private tutoring and discusses government
   responses to private tutoring in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
   Croatia, Georgia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine
   (research conducted in 2004-2005) and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
   Tajikistan (research conducted in 2005-2006). The article analyzes
   various policy contexts and examines challenges that confront education
   stakeholders and policymakers as they formulate their responses to the
   rapidly-spreading and constantly-changing phenomenon of private
   tutoring. Finally, the article discusses whether, and to what extent,
   the existence of regulatory mechanisms influences the scope, nature, and
   implications of private tutoring across the countries of Eastern Europe
   and Central Asia.},

Journal = {GLOBAL GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {403-421},

Abstract = {Numerous international organizations play a key role in generating and
   sustaining migration governance across the world in the absence of a
   global migration regime. However, global governance scholarship lacks
   grounded understanding of their role, which is often rejected or simply
   left unnoticed. In rare cases when lOs do get academic attention, light
   is shed on two referent ``migration{''} lOs the International
   Organization for Migration and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
   while other lOs remain in their shadow. Drawing on the case of the
   post-Soviet Central Asia, which is characterized by both significant
   migration dynamics and multilayered governance but has so far escaped
   attention of migration governance scholars, this article takes two steps
   for establishing a new research agenda. First, it deploys and applies to
   lOs the concept of global migration governors defined as authorities who
   exercise power across borders for the purpose of affecting migration
   policy. Second, it moves discussion beyond the referent lOs and
   demonstrates the role of often overlooked nonreferent lOs, such as the
   World Bank, active in the field of migration governance. This analysis
   is based on fieldwork in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
   and Russia conducted in 2011-2015.},

Abstract = {There is an enormous interest in development interventions aimed at

   about how women's aspirations influence their gender attitudes, the
   marriages into which they select and their involvement in
   intra-household decision-making. We find that women in Kyrgyzstan with
   higher aspirations are more likely to espouse egalitarian gender
   attitudes, as are their husbands, and their husbands have higher
   aspirations. They also live in households in which women play a greater
   role in decision-making, and in which spouses are more likely to agree
   about women's roles in decision-making.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The nation-building projects in much of post-socialist Eurasia have been
   characterized by the promotion of ethnic majorities and marginalization
   of minority groups. In dialogue with the scholarship on nation-building,
   ethnic exclusion and conflict, and ethnic migration, this study examines
   individual views on current and future interethnic relations,
   assessments of prospects for own ethnicity, expectations for future
   economic changes, and intentions to migrate abroad in the multiethnic
   nation of Kyrgyzstan. I use nationally representative survey data to
   model differences in these outcomes across the majority-minorities
   divides and between regional subgroups of the nation's ethnic majority.
   The results show that a native minority that experienced recent ethnic
   violence has the most negative assessment of current interethnic
   relations. However, the minority group of outside origin, which never
   suffered direct violence but whose size and societal preeminence have
   eroded rapidly, is least optimistic about the future and is most
   inclined to migrate. Yet, the analyses also detect substantial regional
   differences within the ethnic majority, underscoring the complexity of
   historically-rooted ethnocultural and socioeconomic cleavages as well as
   of more recent political experiences. I interpret these findings within
   the context of evolving meanings of ethnic identity and national
   belonging in this rapidly changing society.},

Title = {Could Changing Power Relationships Lead to Better Water Sharing in
   Central Asia?},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Even though Central Asia is water rich, water disputes have
   characterized the region after crumbling of the Soviet Union in 1991.
   The uneven spatial distribution and complex pattern of transboundary
   water sources with contrasting national water needs have created an
   intricate water dilemma. Increasing national water needs, water claims
   by surrounding countries, uncertainties in renewable water volumes, and
   effects of climate change will put further strain on the future water
   use in Central Asia. We argue that the present power distribution with
   three downstream hegemons (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and
   two upstream much poorer countries with less political influence
   (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) is not likely to lead forward to a greater
   willingness to share water. We discuss this situation with the analogue
   Egypt-Sudan-Ethiopia in the Nile Basin. Thus, as in the case of Ethiopia
   in the Nile Basin, gradually economically stronger upstream countries
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan due to hydropower development are likely to
   eventually re-define the hydropolitical map of Central Asia. As in the
   case of the Nile Basin, a more even power balance between upstream and
   downstream countries may lead to an improved political structure for a
   much needed better collaboration on water issues.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Around the world, state water management organizations are the agents
   delegated to implement basin-level integrated water resources management
   strategies. In Central Asia, the hydrographic water management-deeming a
   river basin or a catchment area a proper water management unit-is a
   widely accepted concept. Yet, state water bureaucracies are incapable
   and/or reluctant to interact on water management with the ``outsiders'',
   both domestically and internationally. To overcome this shortcoming,
   basin councils are promoted as formalized platforms to facilitate
   inter-sectoral dialogue, and likewise, to support local participatory
   processes within river basin planning and management. The approach
   offers a framework of integrating water sector planning and management
   with environmental, social and economic agendas of a given basin. State
   water management organizations are designated the role of technical
   secretariats of such basin councils which should be facilitating and
   helping to improve other stakeholders' behavioral response in
   watersheds. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the process
   of implementation of the river basin model through the theory of change
   based on issues, challenges and recommendations identified in the
   transboundary Central Asian Isfara River Basin shared by Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan.},

Abstract = {Central Asian countries are examined pre- and postindependence to
   identify the impact of economic and financial development policies. The
   theoretical background to financial flows and the relation between the
   development of the financial system and economic growth in transition
   economies is analyzed using regression, correlation and Granger
   causality. Data from twenty-seven transition economies in eastern Europe
   and the former Soviet republics for 1992 to 2008 are used. The results
   indicate that the transition reform indicator of the European Bank for
   Reconstruction and Development appears to have a negative growth impact,
   and the results for the indicator of credit to the private sector show
   no significant effect on growth. Moreover, the difference between
   lending and borrowing rates appears to have a negative growth impact, as
   expected.},

Abstract = {This work examines differences in the level of violence of
   counterterrorism measures adopted by Central Asian states. Why do some
   Central Asian governments opt for wanton repression in the name of the
   struggle with terrorism, while others adopt less severe methods of
   control and prevention? To answer this question, this study draws on a
   synthesis of rationalist and constructivist explanations. Like
   rationalists, it posits that the magnitude of terrorism and states'
   material capabilities affect governments' responses to terrorism.
   Following constructivists, the study stresses the impact of ideas about
   the nature of terrorist threats and views on the appropriateness of the
   use of force on the counterterrorism policies of Central Asian states.},

Abstract = {Family violence is among the Grand Challenges for Social Work. Central
   Asian women report high rates of family violence, and yet they have
   limited options for responding to spousal violence. Despite the
   significance of the social problem, social workers are only beginning to
   develop interventions to address spousal violence in Central Asia.
   Authors used the domestic violence module from the 2012 Demographic and
   Health Surveys conducted in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan for analysis of
   spousal dynamics and women's responses to spousal violence. Dependent
   variables were help seeking, physical retaliation against husband, and
   divorce from husband, and independent variables were severe mixed
   violence, injuries, and fear. Authors applied latent class analysis for
   identifying types of violence experienced by women. Logistic regression
   was used to measure associations between variables. Authors utilized
   bootstrapping percentile confidence intervals for assessing the indirect
   effects of severe violence via injuries and fear. Severe mixed violence
   and injuries were related to an increased likelihood of a woman's
   response, while fear of husband reduced the likelihood of physical
   retaliation and divorce. Results suggest a strong need for social work
   interventions.},

Abstract = {The ``New Silk Road{''} or ``One Belt-One Road{''} (also ``Belt and

   which affects various areas of development of many states and regions of
   the world, including security issues, socio-cultural, political,
   diplomatic and civilisational aspects.
   A total of 173 agreements with 125 states and 29 international
   organisations have been signed under this initiative. The project is
   gaining momentum every year and attracts ever more researchers who
   analyse the economic, political, and cultural sides of the project and
   the interaction of the different countries and regions with China within
   the framework of this global enterprise. This article assesses the
   participation of five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) in the Chinese project and
   aims to define the mutual interests of the parties on the basis of
   economic indicators (i.e., ESI, RCA, TDC, and G-L indexes).},

Title = {Role of energy storage in energy and water security in Central Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Central Asia has faced major energy and water security challenges.
   Technically, water from the Pamir and Tian Shan Mountain ranges could be
   sufficient to meet the needs of the countries in the region, if there
   was no temporal mismatch between the availability of water for
   irrigation and electricity generation. While water is required for
   agriculture in downstream countries during the summer, demand for hydro
   electricity generation is mainly in the wintertime in upstream
   countries. With the aid of the open-source MESSAGEix energy systems
   optimization modelling framework, we study a renewable energy transition
   in the region through to 2050, considering innovative long duration
   water and energy storage solutions for optimal management of water and
   energy resources in different seasons. The modelling approach
   demonstrates that the proposed ``dual water and energy storage
   scheme{''}, with two different hydrological cycles for up-and
   down-stream regions, can guarantee enough water for energy generation in
   upstream countries in winter while ensuring water availability for
   irrigation downstream in summer. This scheme is economically feasible
   and, with further detailed analyses and geopolitical considerations, it
   can serve to improve energy security and water resource management,
   towards achieving sustainable development goals in Central Asia.},

Title = {Contesting danger: a new agenda for policy and scholarship on Central
   Asia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {87},
Number = {3},
Pages = {589-612},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Western geopolitical discourse misrepresents and constructs Central Asia
   as an inherently and essentially dangerous place. This pervasive
   `discourse of danger' obscures knowledge of the region, deforms
   scholarship and, because it has policy implications, actually endangers
   Central Asia. This article identifies how the region is made knowable to
   a US-UK audience through three mutually reinforcing dimensions of
   endangerment: Central Asia as obscure, oriental, and fractious. This is
   evidenced in the writings of conflict resolution and security analysts,
   the practices of governments, the activities of international aid
   agencies and numerous lurid films, documentaries and novels. The article
   first establishes the tradition of inscribing danger to Central Asia, in
   both academic and policy discourse, from the colonial experience of the
   nineteenth century through to the post-Soviet transition and subsequent
   considerations of the region in terms of the war on terror. It considers
   several examples of this discourse of danger including the popular US TV
   drama about presidential politics, The West Wing, the policy texts of
   `Washingtonian security analysis' and accounts of danger, insecurity and
   urban violence in the Ferghana Valley. It is argued that popular policy
   and academic texts are relatively consistent across the three dimensions
   of endangerment. This argument is demonstrated through a discussion of
   how policy-making and practice is informed by this discourse of danger
   and of how the discourse of danger is contested within the region. The
   example of urban violence in Osh, Kyrgyzstan and Jalalabad, Afghanistan
   in 2010 demonstrates how opportunities to mitigate conflict may have
   been lost due to the distortions of this discourse of danger. It
   concludes by raising the challenge to policy-makers, journalists and
   academics to contest this western geopolitical discourse and provide
   better accounts of how danger is experienced by Central Asians.},

Abstract = {Land cover is a key variable in the context of climate change. In
   particular, crop type information is essential to understand the spatial
   distribution of water usage and anticipate the risk of water scarcity
   and the consequent danger of food insecurity. This applies to arid
   regions such as the Aral Sea Basin (ASB), Central Asia, where
   agriculture relies heavily on irrigation. Here, remote sensing is
   valuable to map crop types, but its quality depends on consistent
   ground-truth data. Yet, in the ASB, such data are missing. Addressing
   this issue, we collected thousands of polygons on crop types, 97.7\% of
   which in Uzbekistan and the remaining in Tajikistan. We collected 8,196
   samples between 2015 and 2018, 213 in 2011 and 26 in 2008. Our data
   compile samples for 40 crop types and is dominated by ``cotton{''}
   (40\%) and ``wheat{''}, (25\%). These data were meticulously validated
   using expert knowledge and remote sensing data and relied on
   transferable, open-source workflows that will assure the consistency of
   future sampling campaigns},

Abstract = {After a decade of relative neglect post-Soviet Central Asia has become a
   foreign policy priority for the transatlantic community. Both the United
   States and Europe have engaged with the region in recent years in
   pursuit of new strategic interests, including maintaining military
   basing access in support of coalition operations in Afghanistan and
   securing the export of Central Asian oil and gas to the West. Despite
   this period of renewed engagement, however, the quality of democratic
   governance within the region remains poor, especially in comparison with
   other post-communist regions that successfully completed their political
   transitions. In fact, the United States and the European Union have
   often tempered promoting their Central Asian democratization agendas in
   order to maintain access to these strategically important fixed assets.
   The transatlantic struggle to balance the pursuit of strategic interests
   and democratic values has been rendered more difficult by Russia's
   recent resurgence as a regional power. Backed by the Central Asian
   governments, Moscow has challenged the purpose and influence of
   western-based international and non-governmental organizations in the
   region, thereby further diminishing the transatlantic community's
   capacity to promote sustained democratic reforms.},

Abstract = {Dollarization rates in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) region are
   among the highest in the world, with adverse consequences for
   macroeconomic stability, monetary policy transmission, and financial
   sector development. Using dynamic panel data models, we find that
   foreign exchange deposits and loans in the CCA are mainly driven by
   volatile inflation and exchange rates, low financial depth, and
   asymmetric exchange rate policies biased toward depreciation. Although
   there is no unique formula for success, empirical studies and
   cross-country experiences suggest that credible monetary and exchange
   rate frameworks, low and stable inflation, and deep domestic financial
   markets are essential ingredients of any de-dollarization strategy. In
   implementation, policymakers need to consider proper sequencing of
   policies, effective communication as well as risks from potential
   financial disintermediation and instability, and/or capital flight.},

Title = {The Paradox of Water Management Projects in Central Asia: An
   Institutionalist Perspective},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian
   countries have been faced with numerous development challenges in
   agriculture, especially those related to water use. Well-intentioned
   foreign donors and development agencies have stepped in to support local
   farmers, research centers, and public authorities in devising innovative
   solutions. Yet, development aid projects have borne fruit only
   partially. Paradoxically, innovative and apparently useful technologies
   proposed by foreign donors have rarely and only partially succeeded in
   taking root in the local institutional contexts. To explain this
   paradox, this paper draws on the institutional approach which shows the
   possibility of technological innovations being encapsulated by
   dysfunctional institutions. Reviewing recent studies of water-related
   projects in Central Asia, the paper shows this encapsulation to be at
   the core of the development project failures pervasive both in the
   Soviet period and today. If the concept of encapsulation is valid, then
   the current development efforts can be made more effective by detecting
   and counteracting the structures of vested interest on the part of all
   the actors involved, such as foreign donors, public authorities,
   research centers and local farmers.},

Abstract = {P>The dismantling of the Soviet Union and the corresponding independence
   of the Central Asian states in the early 1990s had severe economic
   consequences for the Central Asian Region. The transition from command
   to free-market economies was (and sometimes still is) accompanied by
   dramatic contractions in production in virtually all primary resource
   sectors. However, arguably the most catastrophic and ongoing declines in
   output were to be found in the fisheries sector. This study shows how a
   combination of ecological (most notably the introduction of alien
   invasive species and pollution), economic (increasing abstraction of
   water for irrigation and power generating purposes), social (increased
   impoverishment following the removal of employment guarantees) and
   governance (collapse of local management structures, decrease of support
   to the sector and deterioration of trade relationships with neighbouring
   countries) affected fisheries production and consumption in the Central
   Asian transition economies. In the light of these findings, some general
   observations as how this decline might be arrested or reversed are
   provided.},

Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {114-129},

Abstract = {The paper seeks to develop and explain the concept of small state
   foreign policy specialization, using the example of the Republic of
   Latvia and its engagement with the Central Asian countries. Latvia's
   foreign policy development for the past few years demonstrates an
   increasing self-assertiveness of the small Baltic state. Since leaving
   the Soviet Union, Latvia has been seeking to consolidate its position in
   the Western community of countries, demonstrating that it is a
   trustworthy partner. Most recent developments in Latvia's foreign policy
   demonstrate the country's willingness to share the responsibilities
   within the international system, support its EU and NATO partners, as
   well as advance its own diplomatic goals. The analysis demonstrates that
   the European Union is interested in economic, security and political
   collaboration with the five Central Asian countries, and Latvia has
   natural advantages in its expertise, know-how and historical positioning
   towards the region. Unlike larger EU member states, Latvia can be viewed
   as more understandable and an equal partner in bilateral relations.
   Latvia has chosen its engagement and support for the Central Asian
   countries at the EU level because of both a fair solidarity and the
   efficient use of the limited financial and diplomatic resources that the

Abstract = {The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the

   international norms in Central Asia. The contestation between these sets
   of norms has not led to a complete polarisation between members of the
   two organisations, however. Instead, the OSCE has used a range of
   discursive tactics to reduce political contestation, downplaying some
   contested issues and seeking shared discourses on security threats. This
   article explores these tactics and suggests that these discursive shifts
   may eventually threaten the normative identity of the OSCE and lead to
   the acceptance of a more hybrid set of security-related norms in the

Abstract = {The article discusses the history of the Khorezmian
   Archaeological-Ethnographic Expedition from its inception (1937) to its
   end (1997) after the dissolution of the USSR. Three stages are
   distinguished: pre-war beginnings (1937 to 1941); post-war heyday (1945
   to 1976), the most prolific and successful stage of work; and final
   decline (1976 to 1997) during which work was eventually wound down in
   the wake of the collapse of the USSR. The charismatic director of the
   Expedition, Sergej P. Tolstov, is shown to have been an innovative
   archaeologist and outstanding organizer, but also a skilled
   self-propagandist and (up to a point) a collaborator with the Soviet
   authorities on ideological issues and `imperial' expansion. On the other
   hand, he offered Jewish colleagues a refuge in his own little `empire'
   during Stalin's anti-Semitic campaign. Through the many students trained
   on the Khorezmian Expedition, Tolstov and his senior assistant directors
   had an immense impact on the current generation of Russian
   archaeologists.},

Abstract = {The EU has been involved in various migration governance initiatives in
   Central Asia with ambiguous impact. Among the reasons given to account
   for EU external governance failures in Central Asia figure poor EU local
   expertise, ``awkwardness{''} of states in the region, low level of
   regional cooperation and high conflict potential among Central Asian
   states. This article identifies previously neglected challenges for EU
   migration governance in Central Asia due to the nature of international
   governors present in the field and to the character of relationships
   between them: strategic the lack of donors' coordination, and
   operational limited coordination and often open competition between
   implementing partners. The article concludes by arguing that current EU
   actions in this field form a set of disparate initiatives that do not
   amount to a comprehensive policy seeking to impact migration in Central
   Asia but rather strive to broaden and strengthen EU presence in the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {635-651},
Abstract = {The implementation of liberal peace in the context of both transition
   economies and post-conflict situations often involves policy advice from
   international financial institutions for rapid opening of the economic
   and political systems. Experience, however, shows that the immediate
   outcome is increased poverty and inequality, leading to high social and
   human costs. Efficiency-based inquiries on externally supported state
   building and peacebuilding projects often use a problem solving approach
   which seeks ways to improve performance without questioning the validity
   of the liberal peace model. Inquiries based on critical theory, however,
   question the underlying assumptions and the legitimacy of the project
   itself. Using evidence from Central Asia and Afghanistan, the article
   argues that legitimacy depends on both how much, in the eyes of local
   populations, liberal peace actually improves everyday life, and how much
   it is valued as a goal and adheres to internal norms and values. The
   main proposition is that values determine how the liberal peace model is
   understood, while outcomes impact on how the project is accepted. High
   expectations of protection and welfare during crises also mean that the
   state can play a key role as legitimizer.},

Abstract = {Turkey's role in the ongoing revision of the Euro-Atlantic security

   Euro-Atlantic security alliance needs Turkish cooperation and
   collaboration as much as Turkey needs it, particularly with respect to
   the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. Mutual policy blind spots can be
   eliminated if the stakeholders can focus on substantive policy goals

Pages = {85-103},
Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter analyzes and discusses the food insecurity and
   malnutrition situation in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), with a strong
   focus on the Caucasus and Central Asian countries.
   Methodology/approach - Authors use descriptive statistics to examine
   macro-level, sectoral-level, and household-level data from national and
   international sources to review production, trade, and consumption of
   food and agricultural products in the selected countries. Overall trends
   in economic growth and poverty reduction, constraints and bottlenecks in
   agricultural productivity growth, as well as policies that shape food
   security in the ECA region are analyzed.
   Findings - While the countries that constitute the focus of this chapter
   have shown significant progress in alleviating food insecurity and
   extreme poverty, many risk factors remain, such as inadequate
   micronutrient intake, sub-optimal quality diets, growing obesity rates,
   and high dependence on food imports in a number of the ECA countries.
   Practical implications - Based on the assessment of the food security
   situation in the ECA countries, the authors discuss government actions,
   including those emanating from various global initiatives, being
   implemented to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition.},

Pages = {1683-1697},
Abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that the propensity to cooperate in common
   pool resource dilemmas is higher for small, homogeneous groups with
   efficacious monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms. Given that transition
   from socialist to market economies is associated with larger, more
   heterogeneous groups with diluted opportunities for monitoring and
   sanctioning, individuals in later-stage transition economies may be
   expected to be less cooperative than their early-stage counterparts.
   However, evidence from experiments conducted with subjects in two

Title = {25 Years of Rural Development in post-Soviet Central Asia: Sustaining

Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-79},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To show that post-Soviet rural development in Central Asia has been
   confronted with sustained inequalities, three particular factors are
   analysed in this paper have being viewed as fundamental in influencing
   national and rural development. Firstly, most countries have based their
   growth models on economic nationalism (not only creating borders and
   national institutions, but also choosing inward-looking strategies),
   while leaning one-sidedly on their natural resource wealth
   (carbohydrates such as oil, natural gas and minerals, but also
   industrial crops like cotton). Secondly, and related to the first
   explanatory factor, the region has been struck by hidden and open
   resource-based conflicts, in particular on land and water. Inter-state
   tensions have emerged, in particular between downstream (irrigation
   water dependent) countries, such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and the
   upstream (hydropower energy dependent, and carbohydrate-poor) ones, such
   as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Thirdly, all the countries analysed here
   have followed a rather unequal capital city-centric growth model, using
   the proceeds of exports of mineral wealth (or cotton) for rapid
   urbanisation with little or no investment in rural development,
   resulting in a growing urban-rural divide and increasing rural-urban and
   cross-border migration. While it is recognised that this region is
   indeed a bridge between West and East (also re-emphasised by the Chinese
   `One Belt, One Road' initiative), it is argued in this paper that there
   is a need to reduce these inequalities and unbalanced growth, being that
   they will be an obstacle to the sustainable growth and development of
   rural areas.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},

Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Land degradation is a key issue for Central Asia as an agrarian region.
   Land degradation in Central Asia is usually seen as a technological
   challenge and corresponding solutions are associated with the
   improvement of land-use technology. However, the reality is more
   complicated and multi-faceted. Institutional aspects of land degradation
   in the region are more prominent and yet unnoticed. De-linked water and
   land rights, increased land production functions, water infrastructure
   degradation, a lack of water-use monitoring, and a lack of knowledge
   among water users constitute the major institutional aspects of land
   degradation in Central Asia. This paper looks at the linkages between
   water and land rights and the main aspects of land degradation. The
   research was built on a literature review, including internationally
   funded project reports and in-house investigations.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {359-378},
Abstract = {This article uses data from household income surveys to look at income
   structures amongst households in three mountainous regions of
   Tajikistan: Gorno-Badakhshan, the Rasht Valley and Eastern Khatlon. The
   structure of incomes demonstrates the dominant role of subsistence
   agriculture in all three regions although commercial agriculture is
   important amongst better-off households in Rasht. Relationships between
   poverty and household characteristics including access to capital,
   demographic variables and income-generating activities were examined. It
   was found that diversification of income sources was an important
   element in reducing the likelihood of being poor. Low access to land and
   livestock ownership and large numbers of children are the three
   characteristics most strongly associated with poverty. Economic
   activities reducing the risk of being poor include migration and
   ownership of a business, with salaries and wages being less significant
   as incomes from these activities are so low. Those families selling
   agricultural or livestock produce are amongst the least likely to be
   poor, having a production surplus and access to markets. The poor thus
   include those who have not benefited from the land reform process, who
   live in agriculturally marginal areas, have large numbers of children
   and no migrant labour.},

Abstract = {This forum brings together five different angles on the question as to
   whether and how political regimes and forms of order-making can and

   discussion engages critically with this and associated concepts, such as
   `illiberal peace' and `authoritarian conflict management', which have
   been developed out of the Central Asian / Eurasian context and discussed
   in their wider global ramifications and, within the framing of
   `illiberal peace', explored in various contexts in and beyond Central
   Asia. While further assessing the relevance and implications of this
   approach, this forum also attempts to think beyond `illiberalism' by
   introducing and discussing the idea of `post-liberalism'. This way, the
   authors engage in an exchange that serves to probe both concepts and to
   determine their strengths and limitations when it comes to analysing and
   understanding politics and societal processes in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strategies of two satellite operators working
   across post-communist territories of Central Asia: Eutelsat and Kazsat.
   To do so it develops a critical approach called footprint analysis,
   which involves investigating the variety of practices that occur within
   range of a given satellite's service. Satellites have been used in
   post-communist territories to circulate broadcast and telecommunication
   signals, facilitate flows of capital and reshape geographic imaginaries.
   In addition, satellites have become orbital platforms for the Caspian's
   booming oil industry. Satellites are used to support everything from
   surveying oil fields to monitoring drilling operations, from
   construction of oil rigs to the maintenance of pipelines. The article
   sets out to develop a model of analysis which can account for the more
   `cultural' uses of satellites (i.e. for broadcasting) in relation to
   their more `extractive' uses (i.e. for natural resource development).},

Abstract = {China, Russia and the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan formed the Shanghai Co-operation Organization
   (SCO) in 2001. China's backing for an SCO charter, permanent secretariat
   and anti-terrorism centre for the past three years reflects its desire
   to strengthen the SCO in countering United States influence in Central
   Asia. Diplomatically, China fears that the American presence means that
   regional states will be less accommodating to China's political demands.
   Economically, China worries that the United States' support for American
   petroleum companies will compromise Chinese efforts to wrest concessions
   from Central Asian governments. Security-wise, with bases close to
   China's western borders, Washington can assist Beijing in flushing out
   Xinjiang separatists operating in Central Asia, or put military pressure
   on China, should it be perceived as a threat. The American presence and
   resurgent Russian involvement in Central Asia seem to have put China's
   influence in the region on the defensive.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the interrelation between law and hope in the
   context of constitutional change in the Central Asian country of
   Kyrgyzstan. Drawing upon ethnographic and textual data, it is shown that
   the constitution has acquired particular discursive importance in
   Kyrgyzstan each time the foundations of the state have been severely
   challenged or shattered. Paying particular attention to three major
   political conflicts, the article demonstrates how, in the aftermath of
   each, speeches, performances, presentations and conversations were
   infused with `constitutional faith', binding together the political
   elite and ordinary citizens in an expression of their general hope that
   constitutional change could bring about a better future. I view
   constitutional faith as a practice of hope that allows people to
   actively engage with their being-in-the-world, particularly in times of
   crisis. In the aftermath of large-scale political conflict, with which I
   am concerned here, it can become a faith-based mode of conflict
   resolution.},

Title = {Monitoring variations of inland lakes in the arid region of Central Asia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Inland lakes are the major surface water resource in the arid regions of
   Central Asia. Therefore, the surface area changes in inland lakes have
   been a sensitive indicator of climate changes and human activities, and
   have often been the focus of ecological and environmental research. This
   study aimed to monitor the changes in surface area of nine major lakes
   over a 32-year period. The water body was extracted from MSS images from
   the mid-1970s, TM images from the early 1990s, ETM + images in the late
   1990s, and TM images in 2007. The results indicated that the total
   surface area of these nine lakes had decreased over time to 50.38\% of
   the area, from 91402.06 km(2) in 1975 to 46049.23 km(2) in 2007. As the
   surface area of lakes in the western part of Central Asia was larger
   than that in the eastern part, the shrinking trend of lake area was more
   significant in the west than in the east. There was a varied reduction
   of closed lakes in flat regions. The most substantial decrease was in
   the surface area of closed lakes in flat regions. Most significantly,
   the area of the Aral Sea was reduced by 75.7\% from its original area in
   1975. The area of alpine lakes remained relatively stable; the change in
   surface area was less than 0.7\% during the period 1975-2007. The area
   change in opened lakes with outlets was notably different from the other
   two types. The area of Zaysan had increased sharply by 5.85\%, and that
   of Bosten had decreased by 9.1\%. Sasykkol had hardly any changes in
   this period. Due to global climate warming, vapor transfer to the south
   via westerly winds had been blocked, resulting in a decrease of
   much-needed precipitation in the western parts of Turkmenistan,
   Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan between 1970 and 2000. The decrease in
   precipitation and the increase in water consumption for agricultural
   irrigation resulted in the decrease of river runoff. Consequently, the
   area of inland lakes in Central Asia shrank over the past 32 years.},

Abstract = {Tremendous urban transformations in two Central Asian cities since the
   early 20th century have resulted in remaking the subjectivity and
   worldview of its inhabitants. This article explores the connections
   between urban materiality and human subjectivity, and argues that, while
   their relationship is complex and mediated by specific socio-historical
   processes, the former can play a consequential role in producing the
   latter. The study examines ethnic Uzbeks in the cities of Osh and
   Jalalabat, located today in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan. The analysis traces
   three historical moments - the Soviet period, the 1990s, and the first
   decade of the 2000s - when shifts in urban material conditions were
   understood to carry great stakes in the shaping of the personhood of
   city dwellers. This insight may have a bearing on the possible future
   resolution of the serious inter-ethnic conflict between Kyrgyzs and
   Uzbeks in those cities, which erupted in 1990 and 2010.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Realists characterize the contemporary international system as a field
   of competing units of various sizes and capabilities, struggling by
   means of strategies of self-advancement to achieve goals that are
   sometimes common, sometimes contradictory. The nation-state is the
   fundamental unit in the realist constellation of actors. Large and
   resourceful states can achieve their goals through partnership,
   influence, alliance, demand, and coercion. Small and less resourceful
   states find the strategies at their disposal more constrained. Hence
   small states are encouraged by realist doctrine to pursue strategies of
   aggregation, coalition-formation, and integration. Thus, realist
   prescriptions for the small state encourage strategies that run counter
   to the realist explanation of international dynamics. Are realist policy
   prescriptions for the small state necessarily anti-realist? This paper
   addresses this question through an analysis of realist theory with
   respect to the foreign policy strategies of a small Central Asian state,

   1924. My fresh reading of Aitmatov's Soviet-era classic as more
   ambiguous than originally thought and its subsequent reinterpretations
   in recent Kyrgyz cinema corroborates David Chione Moore's seminal
   argument about the reality of post-colonialism in the post-Soviet space
   while also revealing the productive tension between the two conflicting
   views of the Soviet experiment as non-colonial or ``simply differently
   configured{''} colonial. Even though Aitmatov privileges Soviet culture
   over ``backward{''} Kyrgyz ways and wages a socialist realist struggle
   between the old and the new in The First Teacher, this early narrative
   crafted during the Thaw builds in a lot of ambiguity about the Soviet
   project in Kyrgyzstan. I argue that the novella's pronounced Thaw
   idealism and its revision of the Stalinist myth of the ideologically
   driven positive hero, combined with the young writer's subtly
   articulated Kyrgyz values that exist alongside and often in tension with
   his distinct Soviet persona, all allow for a more flexible
   interpretation and negotiation of a hybrid, ambivalent, and multivalent
   post-Soviet Kyrgyz culture and nationhood in contemporary Kyrgyz cinema.},

Title = {``The remediation policy after mining works in the Kyrgyz Republic{''}},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {304-310},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {According to the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic,
   the mining industry in 2014 had more than 53.9\% of the value of all
   industrial products, while the share of the mining industry in GDP in
   the same year was more than 10\%. Under the former Soviet Union, the
   mining industry was of great importance in the Kyrgyz Republic. In the
   last 20 years, discoveries of large gold deposits and other valuable
   minerals brought Canadian and other international corporations to
   exploit. These companies operate without clearly detailed land re
   mediation law and regulations. Many unresolved and partially resolved
   issues on disposal, reclamation of disturbed lands after mining,
   including radioactive waste, have been dealt in a case-by-case manner.
   This paper examines the current situation of the post-mining land
   remediation policy in the Kyrgyz Republic. It focuses on the legal and
   political frameworks for land remediation after mining works. The topic
   about re mediation has not gained much academic attention in the Kyrgyz
   Republic and other developing countries, especially as it is related to
   remediation policies, but this matter is urgent in the country. The
   Kyrgyz government has updated some strategies to deal with land
   remediation issues. However, this paper reveals that these recent
   efforts are still short of securing the health of the environment, which
   is the bedrock of the national wealth today and tomorrow. The discussion
   also shows how laws and regulations define and stipulate about
   remediation issues.
   This paper reveals that post remediation regulations do not give a
   well-defined guideline for administering remediation actions.
   Consequently, the land law that stipulates procedure on remediation
   activities are not well explained and do not provide detailed
   information. In establishing this remediation policy, the first step to
   be taken is to clearly define land remediation. The second step is to
   identify the types of remediation processes. The third step is to create
   new guidelines for appropriate remediation works by clarifying
   responsible agencies and establishing an adequate fund for all the works
   required, including monitoring and skill training.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate interdependences between entry into a
   marital union, childbearing, and migration. We apply event-history
   techniques to retrospective data on women aged 18-29 from a survey
   conducted in northern Kyrgyzstan in 2005 to examine how these events can
   influence one another, with a special focus on the effects of duration
   of exposure. In our analysis, we account for several duration
   dependences ('clocks'). The results illustrate that months since
   marriage formation is the most important duration variable in the
   first-birth propensities model. Out-of-wedlock conception is associated
   with increased marriage risks prior to the childbirth. Migration is
   often a part of the family-formation process: High first-birth
   propensities of recent migrants, as well as high migration risks among
   pregnant women, are due to marriage-related migration.},

Abstract = {The Kyrgyz Republic joined the WTO twenty years ago with the expectation
   that structural reforms required for obtaining membership and the
   application of trade rules would facilitate its transformation from a
   centrally planned to a market economy and ease its integration into the
   WTO multilateral trading system. It completed its accession process in
   record time, liberalized its economy considerably, reduced tariffs
   significantly, and made substantial commitments in a broad range of
   services sectors. It adopted legislation in all areas required for WTO
   membership and created competitive market access conditions for goods
   and services. Looking back at two decades of WTO membership, there is
   evidenced that the reform process is paying off. Trade has expanded
   significantly and new markets have been tapped for imports and exports,
   thus decreasing its dependency on traditional trading partners. As a
   result, the economy has grown rapidly. At the same time, many challenges
   remain to further diversify the economy, take better advantage of
   opportunities offered in the services trade, attract foreign direct
   investment, and fully implement all WTO related laws, rules, and
   regulations. The reform process continues to be essential to
   Kyrgyzstan's economic policies to deepen and solidify its integration
   into the world trading system.},

Journal = {DEMOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},

Number = {3},
Pages = {861-882},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The demographic literature on union formation in post-communist Europe
   typically documents retreat from marriage and increase in cohabitation.
   However, sociological and anthropological studies of post-Soviet Central
   Asia often point to a resurgence of various traditional norms and
   practices, including those surrounding marriage, that were suppressed
   under Soviet rule. We engage these two perspectives on union formation
   by analyzing transition to first marriage in Kyrgyzstan both before and
   after the collapse of the USSR. We use uniquely detailed marriage
   histories from a nationally representative survey conducted in the
   period 2011-2012 to examine the dynamics of traditional marital
   practices among that country's two main ethnic groups-Kyrgyz and
   Uzbeks-focusing on trends in arranged marriages and in marriages
   involving bride kidnapping. The analysis reveals instructive ethnic and
   period differences but also indicates an overall decline in the risks of
   both types of traditional marriage practices in the post-Soviet era. In
   fact, although the decline has characterized all marriage types, it was
   more substantial for traditional marriages. We interpret these trends as
   evidence of continuing modernization of nuptiality behavior in the
   region.},

   their return to their home country. The article focuses on the case of
   Kyrgyzstan, which has had a number of international study abroad
   scholarship programmes since its independence from the Soviet Union in
   1991. The research was exploratory and utilized in-depth interviews for
   collecting data.
   In agreement with the literature, the research found that the alumni of
   scholarship programmes had experienced changes in their values and
   woridviews as a result of being exposed to a new environment but also of
   having a formalized study programme that enabled them to critically
   reflect on their own country and culture and to expand their knowledge
   in the new context. These changes prompted most participants in the
   research to be civically engaged in the social and political issues of
   their society in their home country through voluntarism. Importantly,
   the article expands the literature by arguing that this civic engagement
   has positive implications for the development of civil society and
   democratic values and practices in Kyrgyzstan.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses Kyrgyz `time-telling', exploring how Kyrgyz herders
   and villagers `tell' of their experience of time through genealogies,
   family stories and epic poetry. The author takes a phenomenological
   approach, drawing on different forms of narrative; interweaving history,
   myth and story; revealing the life within the past, as genres mesh (and
   not always seamlessly). She argues that the lived experience of
   `time-telling' works through narrative, memory, sound, performance, and
   poetics, providing a matrix through which the past is continuously
   brought to life for performers and audience alike. The paper is in three
   parts. The first sets the scene, exploring three interwoven, kin-related
   Kyrgyz genres - family trees, genealogies, and epic poetry. The second
   looks at diverse manifestations of the Kyrgyz epic Manas, and its
   interpenetration with social life. The third reveals how different forms
   of performing and remembering the epic bring the past to life through
   the act of performance.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the role of risk attitude for entrepreneurship by
   gender differences in Kyrgyzstan. Logit analysis is applied to the
   cross-sectional data set drawn from the nationally representative survey
   for 2011. Entrepreneurship is measured by the self-employment activities
   and analysed by the agricultural and non-agricultural sample. Results of
   the study show that more risk-taking preferences are associated with
   higher entrepreneurship probability. However, this effect is not
   persistent for women in further estimations for non-agricultural
   entrepreneurship sample, while for men higher positive effect of risk
   loving behavior remains in off-farm self-employment too. These findings
   underline the existing difference in risk tolerance by gender in
   non-agricultural employment. Movement of women from farm to off-farm
   entrepreneurship may not necessarily require risk loving
   characteristics. However, further analysis of this difference should
   take into account potential difference of necessity and opportunity
   entrepreneurs by gender.},

Abstract = {Turkmenistan is currently one of the key suppliers in the global natural
   gas market, and it is important to examine its competitive position in
   the world. The aim of this article is to forecast the development
   strategy of its gas sector. To achieve this aim, the authors first
   examined: (1) Turkmenistan's position in the global gas market and the
   structure of its oil and gas sector; (2) the share of gas in
   Turkmenistan's exports. They then conducted an analysis of the causal
   relationship between FDI and GDP. The above research made it possible to
   conduct a comprehensive SWOT analysis. Based on the SWOT analysis, three
   sector development scenarios were developed: pessimistic, realistic, and
   optimistic. On their basis, the gas sector in Turkmenistan can build
   strategies for its development, considering the impact of market and
   non-market factors.},

   correlates with the early twentieth-century average wealth of their

   wealth inequality in the early twentieth century. The likely channels of
   persistence are the inter-generational transmission of human capital,

   cannot explain persistence.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of male migration on the labor force
   participation of the women left behind in Tajikistan. Studies from many
   countries show that when men migrate, female labor force participation
   decreases and this is largely explained by the income effect from
   remittances. Our study challenges this finding. Using panel data from
   2007, 2009 and 2011, we find that, in Tajikistan, migration has no
   significant effect on the number of hours that women work. We use panel
   data which allow us to control for unobservable heterogeneity, rather
   than the cross-sectional data used by others. We analyze several
   countervailing factors that may have neutralized the income effect, such
   as the need to substitute for the missing labor in the household. We
   also find that women work more when the household has a farm, regardless
   of the presence of a migrant in the household.},

Title = {Islamic Banking in Kazakhstan Law},
Journal = {REVIEW OF CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN LAW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-32},
Abstract = {Kazakhstan has adopted legislation designed to facilitate Islamic
   banking, and at least one Islamic bank has started operations in
   Kazakhstan. Islamic banking is based upon traditional Islamic law, which
   forbids the taking of interest, the making of profit without risk, and
   profiting from ``sinful{''} businesses such as pornography. The
   legislation in Kazakhstan forbids such activities for Islamic banks and
   also requires each Islamic bank to have an independent ``Council on the
   principles of Islamic finance{''} to rule on bank policies and specific
   transactions. Islamic banking practices use complex combinations of
   transactions, each permitted by Islamic law, to mimic common
   conventional banking transactions, such as loans bearing fixed interest
   rates and repayable on a fixed date. Stable income and manageable
   principal obligations from credit-worthy borrowers can ensure that a
   bank will receive high ratings from leading international credit rating
   agencies and, thus, can satisfy the requirements of Kazakhstan's bank
   regulators.
   The formal difference between Islamic banking transactions and the
   conventional transactions that they mimic could lead to differing
   treatment for taxation. To provide a level playing field, Kazakhstan has
   amended its Tax Code to provide for equal treatment of economically
   equivalent Islamic and conventional banking transactions. Adjustments
   have also been made to bankruptcy legislation, reflecting the
   unavailability of deposit insurance for Islamic banks and the special
   nature of investment deposits in Islamic banks.
   There are controversies among Islamic law scholars as to whether or not
   various practices used to mimic conventional banking transactions are
   unlawful because they violate the spirit of Islamic law. This creates
   what is called ``Sharia risk{''}, the risk that a transaction will be
   found unlawful after it has been concluded, with consequences highly
   unfavorable for a party.},

Abstract = {We describe artifacts from a burial from the period of Barbarian
   Invasions on the northeastern Caspian coast (Mangystau Region, Republic
   of Kazakhstan), near the contemporaneous settlement of Karakabak. The
   principal finds, representing the Shipovo horizon, suggest a date of
   late 5th to early 6th centuries. They reveal a mixture of Sarmatian and
   Late Sarmatian features with certain innovations. The origin of the
   latter is discussed. Metal artifacts belonging to the polychrome style
   (cloisonne work) make it possible, for the first time, to include the
   Mangystau Peninsula in the distribution range of the ``Pontic
   fashion{''}. We propose that these artifacts are of local origin, and
   that the craftsman replicated certain standards without the appropriate
   tools. The technological characteristics of the pendant and rings had
   been observed by previous scholars in late Eastern European artifacts
   associated with the Byzantine school. Their dates (5th-6th centuries)
   correlate with those of the fifth stylistic group of polychrome
   artifacts described by I.P. Zasetskaya. Our findings suggest that
   Karakabak, a craft and trade center, was the place where Byzantine-style
   cloisonne artifacts were manufactured. These were supplied to nomadic
   tribes inhabiting the Aral-Caspian area during the Hun and post-Hun
   periods.},

Abstract = {In addition to transferring about 16 percent of GDP from exporters to
   importers, Uzbekistan's quasi-fiscal multiple exchange rate regime
   generates identifiable welfare losses of 2-8 percent of GDP on import
   markets and up to 15 percent on export markets. These excess burdens
   have increased substantially with the growing difference among exchange
   rates. The welfare analysis allows some conclusions regarding the
   optimal reform strategy: (i) welfare losses will decline
   overproportionally as exchange rates unify, (ii) exchange rate
   unification should be supplemented by changing the explicit fiscal
   system; (iii) at a minimum, Uzbekistan would benefit from moving to an
   explicit fiscal regime.},

Abstract = {Cultural exchanges are an essential component of humanitarian
   interaction between countries and societies, in particular, between
   political partners and neighboring states whose citizens regularly
   communicate with each other. This paper discusses cooperation in the
   area of cultural exchanges between the Russian Federation and one of its
   Central Asian neighbors the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan. To
   date, cultural exchanges and humanitarian cooperation have received very
   little attention in Central Asian studies, despite the attention paid to
   Russian-Turkmen economic cooperation and policy aspects. This paper is
   aimed at illuminating the modes, factors, dynamics, and defining
   features of the Russia-Turkmenistan cooperation in the area of cultural
   exchanges over the recent decade. The notions ``cultural exchanges{''},
   ``humanitarian cooperation{''}, and ``cooperation in the area of
   cultural exchanges{''} are explored in Russian-Turkmen diplomatic
   documents and the legislation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
   The author has studied such sources as diplomatic documents, interviews,
   newsletters of state institutions and non-governmental organizations,

Journal = {VIOLENCE AND VICTIMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1124-1147},
Abstract = {Background: Violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners
   (IPV) is a sufficiently serious social issue in the countries of the
   former Soviet Union to warrant focused attention and sociological
   research. In spite of recent advances in the understanding of the
   prevalence and detrimental consequences of IPV worldwide, little is
   known about IPV in transitional countries, where very few studies have
   been carried out. Investigating IPV against women in different societies
   and analyzing micro- and macro-level factors (i.e., social, economic,
   psychological, etc.) that contribute to IPV is important for social
   scientists in order to understand the nature of IPV and to combat it.
   Objectives: The aims of the study were to examine the prevalence of
   physical IPV in Tajikistan and discuss the risk factors for IPV in this
   country of the former Soviet Union. Method: This research is based on
   the data from the Tajik Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in
   2012. SPSS 21.0 and STATA 13 were used for statistical analysis, which
   involved a multistep process and included a series of statistical
   methods such as a univariate descriptive analysis of IPV predictor and
   outcome variables and a multilevel regression model for survey data to
   estimate the effect of individual- and community-level characteristics
   and to take into consideration the multilevel nature of IPV. The
   analyses rely upon binomial and ordered logistic regression models.
   Results: The results of this study demonstrate that physical IPV is not
   a rare phenomenon in Tajikistan where 18\% of women in this region have
   experienced IPV at some point of their lives, and the rate of lifetime
   occurrence of IPV is 17.5\%. While women's older age and living in rural
   area are protective factors against IPV in Tajikistan, risk factors for
   physical IPV include higher number of children, household wealth,
   women's employment, partner's alcohol consumptions, witnessing IPV in
   women's family of origin, justification of IPV by women, and partner's
   controlling behavior. Conclusion: The current study provides evidence
   that a significant number of women are physically abused by their
   intimate partners in Tajikistan. In the context of the significant
   structural changes and the strengthening of patriarchal ideology
   resulted by the collapse if the Soviet Union, an examination of the risk
   factors of IPV in this region is well-timed and important for the
   understanding of gender relations and gender-based violence.},

Abstract = {Consumer perception and willingness to pay for genetically modified
   foods have been extensively studied in recent years. However, until so
   far there is little empirical evidence for genetically modified food
   acceptance among Central Asian consumers. This article contributes to
   existing literature in this field by exploring consumers' acceptance and
   willingness to pay for genetically modified potatoes in Tajikistan. A
   dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is used as a primary
   empirical tool. The data was collected in a major city of Tajikistan.
   The results indicate that more than half of survey participants are not
   aware of genetically modified potatoes. Yet, the majority of consumers
   expressed a positive or neutral opinion about this particular product
   and for two-third of respondents no risks are associated with
   genetically modified potatoes. These results highlight that Tajik
   consumers seem to be less risk-averse towards genetically modified food
   than consumers in Europe. This study explores consumer preferences for
   genetically modified potatoes in Tajikistan. A contingent valuation
   method is applied to measure consumers' willingness to pay for this
   particular genetically modified product based upon socio-demographic
   variables as well as predictors related to individuals' attitudes and
   perceptions. Findings of the paper show the relevance and possibility to
   introduce and market nonconventional potato in a Central Asian market of
   Tajikistan.},

Abstract = {Two agricultural economists examine the impact of a series of
   institutional changes during the 1990s on patterns of land ownership,
   farm income, crop specialization, and overall agricultural output in
   Turkmenistan. More specifically, the changes investigated entail the
   distribution of state-held irrigated land to private plots in 1990-1992,
   allocation of land to independent private farmers in 1993-1996, and the
   conversion of collective and state farms to associations of private
   leaseholders in 1996-1997. The study is based on official government
   statistics and the authors' survey of private farmers (200 1) and
   leaseholders in peasant associations (2002).},

Abstract = {In this paper, the determinants of the intention to use online learning

   analysis. A total of 541 responses from students, enrolled in online
   courses during the fall and spring semesters 2016-2017, were used to
   examine students attitude toward online education. In addition,
   interviews with six instructors were conducted. Results showed that
   success of students in e-courses depend on year of education and the
   academic major of students. Factors, defined in the scope of this work,
   namely, technical characteristics of LMS, ease of use, feedback options
   of LMS and advantages of LMS use, were also found to be significant for
   students in their success in online courses. In interviews with
   instructors, three main points were highlighted, namely, problem with
   students' perception of online courses, lack of online education
   experience among instructors and administrative issues.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the changing intersections between religion
   and politics in Muslim Central Asia. Adopting a long-term historical
   perspective, it shows how successive regimes meshed and clashed with
   Islam in their efforts to assert worldly power. Religion was uniformly
   marginalised in the era of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist socialism, but the
   cases of Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Xinjiang show that religion has
   been playing somewhat different roles across the region since 1991. For
   the secular authorities, Islam may be valued as a source of nation
   building or it may be feared as a potentially destabilising force. The
   resulting attempts to co-opt, channel and control religious expression
   provide insights into the nature of secular power and raise questions
   concerning the applicability to this region of influential theories in
   the sociology of religion.},

   delivery of education and whether market forces have improved the
   management of schools. We conclude with a summary of the economic and
   policy lessons derived thus far from the educational transition. The

Title = {Investments in the energy sector of Central Asia: Corruption risk and
   policy implications},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The world is facing serious energy situation. The sense of urgency to
   guarantee energy security is constantly increasing for many countries.
   Exploiting foreign energy markets through international investment has
   become a significant strategy to resolve energy risks and optimize the
   distribution of energy sources. Central Asia, with the important
   geographical position and various abundant energy resources, has
   attracted the interest of the international community and become a
   popular destination of foreign investments. However, the corruption
   risk, inter cilia, is a big concern for foreign investors, especially in
   the energy sector. The proportion of corruption in international
   investment arbitration cases with the five Central Asian countries as
   the Respondent is high up to 75\% in the energy field. Choosing Central
   Asia as the investment destination in situations like these is a
   decision made after weighing both the opportunities and risks, with the
   purpose to establish resource-seeking investment. Against this backdrop,
   this paper aims to provide policy implications for government
   regulators, policy makers, and foreign investors. It is suggested to
   modify bilateral investment treaties, establish legal framework of
   Central Asian countries, adopt investment facilitation measures,
   strengthen self-discipline and self-protection of investors and
   strengthen investment guarantee system.},

Abstract = {Central Asia presents a unique configuration of historical experience
   and societal responses that have been interacting and evolving for
   thousands of years. The current era of economic, political, and societal
   transformation in Central Asia began with the peaceful devolution of the
   Soviet Union and transition to the Commonwealth of Independent States in
   December 1991. Expectations about the natural social order based on
   western beliefs and experience may not apply in this part of the world,
   for-like all transitional and emerging market economies-Central Asia has
   inherited another social order that predates recent history. The field
   of Business Ethics provides an arena in which these issues can be
   explored. In this article, an overview of the current standing of
   Business Ethics as a field for teaching, training, and research in
   Central Asia is provided. Suggestions for further consideration and
   future research are presented in the concluding section.},

Title = {The Evolutionary Trends and Convergence of Cereal Yield in Europe and
   Central Asia},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The state of food security in the world, including that of Europe and
   Central Asia (ECA), was highlighted in 2020 by the outbreak of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, when the fact that the food security status of
   millions of people in ECA, particularly the most vulnerable and those
   living in fragile contexts, would deteriorate if swift action was not
   taken as soon as possible became apparent. Improving cereal yield is the
   key for the ECA to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target
   2.1 to end hunger by 2030. Impressive cereal yield growth has been
   witnessed within the ECA from 1991 to 2020, but there is still
   significant variation across the five sub-regions. This paper aimed to
   analyze the evolutionary trends and convergence of cereal yield in
   countries of the ECA from 1991 to 2020 for four major cereals: wheat,
   maize, barley and oats. The findings show that there is strong evidence
   of sigma-convergence and absolute and conditional beta-convergence for
   cereal yield in the ECA, which indicates that countries with low yield
   in the initial stages have totally experienced higher growth rate, and
   yield in countries farther away from the steady-state have to have
   faster growth rate to converge to the steady-state. The presence of club
   convergence is also identified in terms of geographic location and
   income level, simultaneously. Therefore, cereal yield in the ECA has
   converged to the whole and to different groups at the same time, which
   provides some evidence of agricultural technology spillover effect in
   the region.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses groundwater resources use and management in the
   socio-economic context of the Amu Darya River Basin which covers a part
   of the following landlocked Central Asian countries: Afghanistan,
   Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. These agrarian nations for
   sustaining their vital agricultural productions started to use
   groundwater during the recent drought years (19982001) because of its
   relatively good quality and quantity and as an alternative to highly
   mineralized surface waters. Present extent of groundwater resources use
   is discussed with consideration to their reserves, quality, and
   institutional management and transboundary aspects within the basin.
   After the collapse of the centralized water resources management system
   and infrastructure of the former Soviet Union, new underdeveloped
   systems are being practiced over the whole Amu Darya River Basin. The
   critical situation of groundwater management in Afghanistan is also
   discussed. This work attempts to document the management and use of
   groundwater in the Amu Darya Basin and present time management
   realities, with fragmented and weak national and regional regulation on
   groundwater. Special attention is given to groundwater resources in
   irrigated agriculture, which increased use in all countries of the basin
   is due to quick access to underground resources and relatively good
   quality and quantity.},

Abstract = {The paper foregrounds analysis of the significance of English in
   individual and collective life in relation to a myriad of feelings that
   religious and ethnic minorities experience in South and Central Asia
   within their multilingual ecology. The data reveal an entangling of
   varied yet coexisting emotions on the part of these minorities in
   Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tajikistan in relation to English and its
   positioning vis-a-vis other languages. The discursive realisation of
   emotion also gives a nascent understanding of the historical, political,
   social, cultural, and material significance of English at the microlevel
   - as the language is practised, nurtured, and sustained with anxieties
   and insecurities as well as desires and hopes of its users. Most
   importantly, the data indicate that English is used to legitimise ethnic
   and religious identity by minority communities. Drawing on findings from
   two ethnographic case studies, the paper thereby suggests the necessity
   of exploring individual metalinguistic awareness and subjective
   ``structures of feeling{''} (Park, Joseph Sung-Yul. 2015. Structures of
   feeling in unequal Englishes. In Ruanni Tupas (ed.), Unequal Englishes,
   59-73. London: Palgrave Macmillan) of users of English in order to
   understand its shifting meanings in varied contexts of Asia. The paper
   thereby brings together understudied areas in Asia, whilst also going
   beyond a South/Central Asia divide by incorporating studies from both

   globalisation in South and Central Asian spaces. International Journal

   Multi-level linkages},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Separating downstream agriculture from upstream hydropower in
   transboundary river basins complicates water management at the national
   level. The shift from hydropower to thermal power supply increases the
   competition for water between agriculture and energy generation,
   accelerates depletion of fossil energy resources, and increases
   greenhouse gas emissions. Because of the competition for scarce water
   between agriculture and energy generation, brackish groundwater
   irrigation has been explored as an option to cover the water deficit in
   Central Asia's lift irrigation zones. This study examines the
   combination of aquifer storage and recovery with drip irrigation to
   improve brackish groundwater quality in the Karshi Main Canal zone. In
   this zone, a cascade of sequential pump stations is used to lift water
   from the transboundary Amudarya River. The method used to evaluate the
   technology is a pilot-scale field study. The results show that
   wide-scale adoption of the technology can produce significant water
   (24\%) and energy savings (19\%), as well as reduced saline flows and
   emissions of greenhouse gases.},

Title = {Does China's Belt and Road Initiative Threaten Food Security in Central
   Asia?},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) needs little introduction; the
   infrastructure investment will reconfigure development in Central Asia.
   As its origin story and initial encounter, Central Asia offers a
   prismatic lens to delve into the vital impacts and significant changes
   wrought by the BRI. In the dryland region, the BRI impact on watersheds
   and agriculture is a critical challenge with direct implications for
   food security. Framed by diverse research sources, we utilized spatial
   datasets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative and
   the World Bank to explore the intersection of food production, water and
   development. Investigation evaluates the possible trade-offs that
   Chinese infrastructure investment can have on the communities and
   environment of Central Asia. The findings identify more than 15,000 km
   of rail and 20,000 km of roads linked to the BRI crisscrossing the
   region in 2018. Whilst these transport corridors have improved
   connectivity, many of these rails and roads traverse important
   agricultural and water zones, creating undetermined risks and
   opportunities. Land use change was examined within a 10-km buffer around
   BRI roads and rails from 2008 to 2018. Railways increased by 23\% during
   this time, yet irrigated and rainfed agriculture decreased whilst urban
   areas markedly expanded. Contextual research identifies how Chinese
   policies may encourage agribusiness investment for food exports as
   possible disruptions to national and regional food supply. However, to
   date Central Asia provides <1\% of Chinese agricultural imports. In
   fact, Afghanistan is the region's dominant export market, tripling
   agricultural imports >300\% in this time. Similarly, five times more
   livestock are traded within the region than to China. Evaluating
   infrastructure change is essential to understand BRI impacts on
   environments and societies, with the food-water nexus a particular
   concern in Central Asia. Limited Chinese imports of Central Asian
   agriculture suggests the region's food security will not be
   significantly altered by the Belt and Road Initiative.},

Title = {Revisiting US-China strategic competition in Central Asia and its impact
   on Pakistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, the US, and China are
   aspiring to enhance their strategic influence in Central Asia which has
   recently been intensified due to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
   Further, China has also increased its influence in Central Asia through
   regional organizations such as Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).
   Against this backdrop, Pakistan emerged as an important pivot of China's
   BRI where the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the flagship
   project. This study begins with a theoretical debate of Heartland theory
   of Halford John Mackinder and the later version of Heartland theory into
   Rimland theory by Nicolas Spykman, which explains the geopolitical
   significance of Central Asia for Major Powers. Within this theoretical
   context, the study discusses China and the US grand strategies in
   Central Asia in the form of China's BRI, SCO and the US
   counter-strategies such as from phase 1.0, policy to 2.0, policy, and
   the recent initiative of C5 + 1. The study finds out that US-China
   strategic competition will have implications for various states having
   relations with both of these two major powers. In case of Pakistan, the
   strategic competition between China and the US will affect various
   dimensions of Pakistan's security at the broader level such as
   political, military, and economic security. First, at the political
   level, it is affecting Pakistan's relations with Russia, China, Iran,
   and Gulf States. Second, at military level, Pakistan's strategic value
   has been enhanced as a frontline state against terrorism. Finally, at
   the economic level, CPEC provides opportunities for Pakistan's economy
   and regional connectivity.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critical analysis of the development of public
   administration education in the context of five post-Soviet,
   transitional, and authoritarian Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan from early
   independence to the present time (1991-2019). The study is based on a
   review of Master of Public Administration (MPA) programmes offered by
   Public Administration Academies in each of these five Central Asian
   countries, a focus group with local academics, extensive secondary data
   analysis, and critical reflections of a local scholar with six years of
   MPA teaching experience in a Kazakhstani university. This article
   highlights context-specific challenges in design and implementation of
   the MPA programmes in Central Asia. These challenges include the:
   ambiguous role of Public Administration Academies; programme design;
   pedagogical issues; and weak research capacity. It is argued that the
   MPA programmes in Central Asia often provide an example of `mimicry' of
   European/North American programmes with peculiar features of their local
   context. Public Administration Academies in Central Asia are highly
   politicised and strongly controlled by authoritarian governments. This
   study will be of particular interest not only to public administration
   scholars from all post-Soviet countries which share the Soviet legacy
   and socio-economic challenges, but also for scholars teaching in other
   authoritarian contexts.},

Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims at connecting the continents
   of Asia, Europe, and Africa through a combination of infrastructure
   projects and soft-power programs. All of the six land bridges and
   maritime routes under the BRI extend westward, mostly passing through
   Central Asia and the Middle East on land or by sea. Cooperation with
   countries in these regions will, according to China's design, meet its
   domestic energy needs, and grow the country's economy. China recognizes,
   however, that in Central Asia and the Middle East, the risks posed by
   what it calls the ``Three Evils{''} - terrorism, extremism, and
   separatism can impact the success of the BRI. They can also impact
   stability in its own adjacent areas, including Xinjiang. Therefore, in
   concert with the BRI, China is also identifying and deploying bilateral
   and multilateral diplomatic mechanisms aimed at security coordination
   with BRI countries in these two volatile regions. This article provides
   an overview of BRI developments in the two regions and examines some of
   the diplomatic mechanisms China is using to coordinate security and
   reduce risks.},

Title = {Civil society, political stability, and state power in Central Asia:
   cooperation and contestation},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {795-825},
Abstract = {This article develops a concept of civil society in Central Asia
   distinct from that which emerged from the East European communist
   societies of the late 1980s. Kazakhstan presents a case study of a civil
   society that conceptually can be located between the vibrant civil
   society of the Baltic democracies and the civil society of the strongly
   repressive environments of Belarus or Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan's
   authoritarian structures and cultural traditions make it difficult to
   develop strong independent civic organizations - cooperation tends to
   mark state-civil society relations more than contestation, which shaped
   much of Eastern Europe's experience. Even in a context of relative
   affluence where civil society organizations are allowed some space to
   engage in critical activities, contestation tends to be minimized. This
   is only partially related to state suppression and cooptation; a
   political culture that views democratic processes as potentially
   destabilizing is also a significant factor. Kazakhstan represents a
   distinct Central Asian model of civil society, comparable to Russia but
   qualitatively different from that found in either Eastern or Western
   Europe, where civil society is less willing to confront the state, more
   cooperative with the authoritarian system, and wary of the potential for
   civic activism to degenerate into instability. Differentiating types of
   civil society is important because a key component of Western democracy
   assistance programmes has been providing assistance to build and
   strengthen civil societies. By refining our understanding of distinct
   civil society patterns in Central Asia, we can enhance our knowledge of
   political processes in this critical region, and we may improve the
   effectiveness of democracy assistance programmes. The study is grounded
   in field research, interviews, civil society workshops, survey research,
   and government documents.},

Abstract = {The interests of China in Central Asia encompass a range of factors,
   including border security, insurgency, economics, energy, and
   geopolitics. Additionally, Central Asia plays an important role in
   China's projects connecting Eurasia and Europe. Likewise, the proximity
   of Central Asia means that instability and security threats in the
   region have spread over impacts in Chinese territory that make Central
   Asia a very important component of China's foreign policy. China has
   promoted a more assertive foreign policy with the rise of President Xi
   Jinping to power, devising a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that aims to
   strengthen China's relationship with the region's countries. The main
   argument of this research is that the growing importance of Central Asia
   in China's foreign policy since 2013 has led Beijing to adopt a strategy
   to deepen trade imbalances, targeted spending in infrastructure and debt
   under the BRI that supports China's ambition to achieve political goals
   in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {The absence of a solid international migration regime and related
   competition between international organisations (IOs) in the field of
   global migration governance bring challenges to their authority and
   legitimacy to the fore. This paper sets to explore how the International
   Organization for Migration (IOM) has reacted to such challenges. For
   this, the paper applies the concept of self-legitimation of IOs. Drawing
   on insights from International Relations and International Political
   Economy as well as on sociology of translation', the paper argues that
   the core self-legitimation strategy and practices of IOM rely on
   knowledge production partnerships with other IOs and relevant local
   stakeholders. To develop this argument, the paper uses the notions of
   challenged and challenging institutions, identifies sources of related
   challenges and the audiences that are important for self-legitimation
   efforts of IOs. It shows how IOM has become both a challenging and a
   challenged institution and how its knowledge production partnerships in
   the post-Soviet Central Asia increase its reputational authority in
   relations with its local and global audiences. This analysis builds on
   fieldwork conducted in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
   in 2011-2015.},

Abstract = {The debate on international water problems is split between the
   analytical perspective of International Relations (IR) and related
   social sciences, on the one hand, and prescriptive, problem-solving
   contributions, on the other hand. This article explores how these
   separate discourses can link up productively by scrutinizing the example
   of Central Asia, especially the Aral Sea basin. Most water conflicts
   there - pointed out by IR ``Malthusian{''} analyses could be handled
   effectively by adopting IWRM principles for water management. However,
   both IR approaches and prescriptive concepts like IWRM need to be
   complemented by a profound knowledge of domestic politics within
   affected states if they are to identify realistic ways for solving water
   scarcity problems.},

Journal = {TOURISM ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {1749-1768},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article explores the determinants of tourist arrivals to Central
   Asia using traditional gravity models and panel data analyses of 108
   countries for the period 2008-2018. The research focuses on relevant
   variables such as income, relative price, travel costs, or the so-called
   economic determinants. The results reveal that tourism in Central Asia
   is considered to be more distance elastic and price inelastic. Tourists
   from North and South America regions are more travel costs elastic
   compared with Asia and the Pacific. Sharing a common language and border
   greatly increases the volume of tourism in Central Asia. The political
   instability in the destination has a negative effect on tourism flows.
   Conversely, political instability at the country of origin in the case
   of Asia and the Pacific significantly increases outbound flows
   especially to Central Asia, suggesting a different reason for travel.},

Abstract = {A multi-levelled liegemonic encounter has developed in Central Asia, in
   which a global hegemon, the USA; a regional hegemon. the Russian
   Federation; all aspirant sub-regional hegemon, Uzbekistan; and,in
   emergent regional and global hegemon, China, co-exist within the
   framework of Central Asian security politics. Where these hegemons'
   interests do not conflict this call be characterised as a matrioshka
   model of hegemony: the different level hegemons can accommodate one
   another peacefully and where their interests coincide they can form
   alliances. The model of multi-levelled hegemony developed here
   highlights the simultaneous presence of competition and cooperation.
   This article explores the way in which the various bilateral hegemonic
   relations in the region also indicate that actual and emergent hegemonic
   states at different levels call cooperate as hegemons in order to
   challenge, or to respond to challenge, by hegemonic states at other
   levels. This helps to clarity the question of whether the increasingly
   competitive interaction between these states is likely to lead to
   conflict.},

   from the region. While some view China's involvement as offering Central
   Asian countries an opportunity for advancement, others view it in more

   of trade with China and China's actions regarding COVID-19, which are
   both polarizing issues in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia overall.},

Volume = {21},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the 1980s, Aleksandr Minkin was a young Russian journalist at the
   beginning of a brilliant career as a literary and theater critic. During
   his tours in Central Asia, he turned to investigative journalism,
   reporting on the unstable circumstances in Soviet peripheries, painting
   a picture for the Soviet public of the brutal side of Bolshevik
   modernization, such as cotton monoculture in Uzbekistan, the
   exploitation of peasants, the spread of deformities and disease in
   children due to the abuse of defoliants and pesticides in rural areas,
   widespread corruption, as well as the general social backwardness of the
   most remote areas of the USSR. In 1988, the magazineOgonekpublished
   Minkin's famous piece `khlopkorab' (cotton slave) - denouncing for the
   first time in the Soviet press the exploitation of child labor in the
   cotton fields - as well as other articles revealing the use of dangerous
   Butifos defoliant, and the spread of illness in the republic. These
   articles caused a sensation and were at the center of a political debate
   during perestroika that both thrilled Soviet readers and frightened the
   Communist party. Minkin was viciously attacked by the official press and
   endured the surveillance of Soviet security authorities, as well as of
   foreign intelligence agencies. However, the campaign to discredit him
   could not cover the scandals up entirely, and Minkin became a symbol of
   free journalism, and a liberal intellectual figure in post-Soviet
   Russia, raising public awareness of social and environmental issues in
   Central Asia that had been officially hidden for decades.},

   focuses on the impact of the Afghan opioid trade on terrorist violence

   Information Systems-enabled visualizations of the drug trade and
   terrorism as well as statistical tests to study the drug-terror
   relationship at the subnational level. Our findings lend support to the
   argument that the drug trade facilitates terrorism, but we also find
   that the drug-terror relationship is multifaceted, complex, and

Abstract = {When the Jews first settled in Central Asia is uncertain, but
   circumstantial evidence clearly indicates that this happened at least
   two and a half thousand years ago. In the first millennium AD, the Jews
   lived only in cities no farther than 750 km east of the Caspian sea (in
   the eighth-eleventh centuries the sea was called Khazarian). Only later
   did they migrate to the central part of the region, to cities like
   Samarkand and Bukhara. It is possible that Jews from Khazaria joined
   them, since they already had tight trade connections with Central Asia
   and China. There is no trace of evidence regarding the existence of Jews
   in the entirety of Central Asia in the early sixteenth century. At the
   very end of the sixteenth century Bukhara became the new ethnoreligious
   center of the Jews in that region. In the first half of the nineteenth
   century, thanks to European travelers visiting Central Asia at that
   time, the term ``Bukharan Jews{''} was assigned to this sub-ethnic
   Jewish group. Drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary source
   materials, this article aims to prove that the presence of Jews in
   Central Asia was not continuous, and therefore the modern Bukharan Jews
   are not descendants of the first Jewish settlers there. It also attempts
   to determine where Central Asia's first Jewish population disappeared
   to.},

Abstract = {Central Asian countries represent an important context for understanding
   intersections between Islam, patriarchy, and women's well-being. In
   recent decades, challenges and opportunities resulting from transitions
   to a market economy exacerbated gender imbalances in labor markets and
   opportunity structures of the region. Women of the region are highly
   educated and make significant economic contributions to support their
   families through employment. However, their views about gender roles
   remain unclear, and it is also uncertain whether opportunity structures
   and social mobility have influenced these views. The current study
   addresses these gaps using probability-based survey data (N = 3,405)
   from four Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
   and Uzbekistan. Latent class analysis reveals three latent profiles of
   women's views on gender roles: traditional views, egalitarian views, and
   dual views. Religious identity, education, opportunity structure, and
   social mobility intersect with women's ideas about gender roles.},

   generated and analyzed in the period 1991-2012. We provide an exhaustive
   overview over all accessible individual and household-level surveys
   undertaken in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
   Uzbekistan - and of all academic papers published using these datasets.
   We argue that Central Asia is a fascinating region for the study of
   comparative economics given its dual experience of transition and
   development. However, the region is also understudied, in part due to
   lack of data, and especially due to a lack of panel data. We identify
   knowledge gaps derived from this lack of longitudinal surveys and
   suggest worthwhile areas for future research. Finally, we also present a
   new and novel individual-level panel dataset called ``Life in
   Kyrgyzstan{''}. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 819-835.

Abstract = {This article discuses the concept of `civil society' and how it has been
   used by the international community to promote democratization. It
   addresses some of the dimensions and side-effects of the policy, such as
   the relationship with traditional societies and power networks. It also
   addresses the importance of attending to the conditions of
   implementation, political issues such as nationalism and Islam, and
   political actors who may only have recent democratic credentials.
   Political democratization-free elections-is clearly popular in the
   Greater Middle East and Central Asia. During the last two years people
   have voted every time they have had the opportunity, despite the
   dangers. The debate concerning the compatibility of Islam and democracy
   overlooks the fact that the main obstacle to democratization in the area
   is usually not a religious but a secular authoritarian regime. The
   difficulty of building a democracy with people we do not consider to be
   democrats is discussed. There can be no democratization process without
   taking into account the mainstream Islamist parties and without
   acknowledging the importance of nationalism. There is a clash between
   the `war on terror' approach and the call for elections: one cannot put
   Hamas and Hezbollah on the terrorist list and call for free elections in
   which both would emerge as legitimate and representative political
   movements.},

Abstract = {The article is concerned with studying the role of yurt and yurt-shaped
   architecture in the culture and art of the Central Asia's people. The
   yurt is symbolical. The deep semantic bases are presented in its form,
   location, colour, decor. The origin, formation and evolution of
   yurt-shaped architecture represent the world view which demonstrates
   rich ethnic and cultural traditions of the nomadic people. The features
   of yurt-shaped architecture of Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are
   considered in this work and we have made an attempt to find general,
   stylistic and semantic characteristics of the Turkic architecture.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Middle Eastern, North African countries (MENA), and Central Asian
   countries are considered the countries most facing water and food
   scarcity. The current water exploitation indicates that a few countries
   are overexploiting their water resources and using the fossil water
   available. This study reviews each country's renewable water resources
   volume and evaluates the resources available to expand the agricultural
   area. Different scenarios are considered, using both irrigated and
   rainfed farming options, for concluding the most sustainable farming
   method in each country. Different scenarios are considered using
   irrigated and rainfed farming options to recommend the most sustainable
   farming method for each country. Results show that the countries in the
   MENA and Central Asia can be divided into three main categories: (1)
   Countries whose expansion of agricultural area can only be applied by
   using fossil water resources (Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar,
   Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan); (2)
   Countries where the agricultural area can be expanded to a certain
   limit, by sustainably using both irrigated and rainfed farming
   (Afghanistan, Algeria, Iran, Palestine, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Morocco,
   Oman, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, and Yemen); (3) Countries that have
   enough renewable water resources to farm all their agricultural area
   (Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan). However, the aim of this study
   and its results are only to assess the renewable water resources
   available to sustain the increased agricultural water demand by setting
   aside other agricultural factors that constrain the sector.},

Abstract = {On the basis of intensive fieldwork in the period 2002-2006, which
   combined interviews with direct observations, the implementation of two
   policies in the field of agricultural water management in Uzbekistan is
   analysed: the reform of the water bureaucracy along basin boundaries and
   the establishment of Water Users Associations. It is shown that the
   Uzbek government used these policies creatively for addressing some
   pressing issues, while the inherent decentralisation objective was
   pushed to the far background. Both reforms are used to strengthen the
   state's grip on agricultural production regulation. The latter is at the
   centre of day-to-day agricultural water management dynamics. It is shown
   that decentralisation policies originally developed in society-centric
   policy processes cannot be easily applied in countries with
   state-centric politics such as Uzbekistan.},

Abstract = {Economic globalization (EG) accelerates very fast in Central Asia. This
   could cause environmental degradation, according to the environmental
   Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study aims to determine how the EG
   of agriculture impacts environmental sustainability, and to test the EKC
   hypothesis on the agricultural sector in six Central Asian countries.
   Particularly, some main hypotheses were proposed using secondary data
   from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
   Uzbekistan from 1994 to 2019. This study uses five explanatory
   variables: agricultural exports value (EXP), agriculture forestry and
   fishing value-added (AVA), the exchange rate (EXR), total natural
   resource rents (RENT), and external debt stocks (DEBT), while the
   dependent variable in this study is the CO2 emissions from on-farm
   energy use (EMS), temperature changes (TEMP), and forest fires (FIRE).
   These data are analyzed using panel data regression. As a result, AVA
   and RENT raise EMS; EXC raises TEMP but lowers EMS; DEBT raises TEMP but
   can lower FIRE. Hence, we propose recommendations to improve this
   condition, including a clear roadmap, enhanced partnerships, and
   regional and international support.},

Abstract = {The vision of the Soviet years in post-Soviet republics varies depending
   on the government's official master narrative, foreign policy
   priorities, and general public perceptions of the past. By contrasting
   the published interviews of presidents Putin, Nazarbayev, and Karimov
   and the outcomes of in-depth interviews with the elderly public in
   Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan), this paper
   reveals the differences between the official master narratives of
   political leadership (positive or negative) with respect to the Soviet
   past and public attitudes. This paper aims to demonstrate that the
   narratives of political leaders/governments and public recollections
   coexist in the same social space in parallel to each other. While
   governments attempt to use their narratives to promote certain policy
   goals, people use their nostalgic recollections to make sense of the
   social changes in their respective countries and use such recollections
   to interpret their lives.},

Abstract = {The construction of the Rogun Dam in the Amu Darya Basin to increase
   upstream energy generation creates potential trade-offs with existing
   downstream irrigation, due to the different timing of energy and
   irrigation water demands. The present analysis, based on a
   hydro-economic optimization model, shows that cooperative basin-wide
   maximization of benefits would lead to large increases in upstream
   hydropower production and only minor changes in downstream irrigation
   benefits. However, if upstream stations, including Rogun, are managed
   unilaterally to maximize energy production, hydropower benefits might
   more than double while irrigation benefits greatly decrease, thereby
   substantially reducing overall basin benefits.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines how banks and microfinance companies
   morally construed and evaluated their lending practices and income in
   Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Banks occupy a powerful position in a
   monetary economy, because they do not merely create money `out of thin
   air', but can charge for it, that is, interest. In doing so, they obtain
   unearned income and extract wealth. The article examines how banks and
   microfinance companies used myths, ideals, discourses, norms and
   emotions to justify and de-politicise their unequal power, unearned
   income and damaging effects. The study draws on the moral economy
   perspective and the post-Keynesian theory of money to understand
   financial institutions' moral justifications and rationalisations of
   their position and power. This article contributes to a wider literature
   on neoliberalism and morality in post-socialist economies.},

Title = {Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Enhancing ICT connectivity in
   China-Central Asia Corridor},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-141},
Abstract = {The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to enhance connectivity and
   collaboration among 60 countries and beyond in Asia, Africa and Europe.
   Information and communications technology (ICT) is an indispensable
   component of the initiative, critical in providing fundamental
   communication channels for global financial transactions, trade
   exchanges and transport and energy connectivity, and socio cultural
   collaboration and scientific exchanges between people, organizations and
   countries along the BRI corridors. Previously constrained by
   infrastructure deficits in ICT, the Asia-Pacific region is accelerating
   its efforts to provide reliable and affordable broadband networks
   throughout the region, to contribute to successful implementation of the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
   Within the BRI corridors, this study which has been undertaken as part
   of the research programme of the United Nations Economic and Social
   Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) on promoting regional
   economic cooperation and integration, focuses on the China-Central Asia
   Corridor (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
   Uzbekistan), giving attention to the sub-region's specific challenges,
   namely limited international transit opportunities and an increase in
   bandwidth requirements that is expected to grow exponentially, as the
   fourth industrial evolution centered on automation and artificial
   intelligence gathers momentum. The sub-region is characterized as highly
   dependent on the ease and costs of connecting to neighboring countries
   for transit, as many countries in the sub-region are landlocked
   developing countries (LLDC). Because of the geographical features and
   other factors, the development potential of Central Asia and its
   integration into globalization, continues to be stymied by insufficient
   international bandwidth and high transit costs to access international
   links. Therefore, improved ICT connectivity in Central Asia through the
   BRI corridor could result in improved availability and affordability of
   broadband networks and services in the sub-region.
   For the purpose of this study, a gap analysis is the methodology that
   underpins the proposed topology for the China-Central Asia Corridor. The
   analysis included examining the current state of the optic
   infrastructure, such as existing and planned fiber-optic networks,
   existing Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) and international gateways. The
   study also identifies the key factors that determine the desired future
   state of infrastructure deployment for the BRI initiative. A topology
   that consists of connecting Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Urumqi (China), as
   core nodes, is proposed based on a partial mesh topology. Over and above
   this core finding, the study concludes that digital infrastructure
   connectivity has a tendency of lagging behind the rapid opportunities
   evolving, and the study therefore advocates for sub-regional and
   regional approaches, including the BRI and Asia-Pacific Information
   Superhighway (AP-IS) in further expanding regional broadband networks. A
   key recommendation of the study is co-deploymentof broadband
   infrastructure along passive infrastructure, as an additional cost
   effective means of achieving fast and affordable broadband connectivity
   for all.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to examine the energy trade pattern of
   Central Asian economies, which are regarded as significantly rich in
   natural resources. To this end, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
   based on the intercountry trade force approach, and data from 2001-2018
   are employed. The empirical results confirm the significant impacts of
   the gravity index, free space of trade, and urbanization level in
   shaping Central Asia's energy trade patterns. Our main conclusion is
   that variables have different impacts on the trade directions of imports
   and exports. In addition, geographical location and language factors are
   crucial for shaping the energy trade policies of Central Asia. The
   study's main economic policy implication is in fostering the free flow
   of energy to achieve better economic integration in Central Asia. In
   addition, to promote the energy infrastructure of the region,
   cooperation and participation of the countries in regional projects like
   the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China is recommended. (C) 2021

Abstract = {We report on a regional flood and earthquake risk assessment for 33
   countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Flood and earthquake risk
   were defined in terms of affected population and affected gross domestic
   product (GDP). Earthquake risk was also quantified in terms of
   fatalities and capital loss. Estimates of future population and GDP
   affected by earthquakes vary significantly among five shared
   socioeconomic pathways that are used to represent population and GDP in
   2030 and 2080. There is a linear relationship between the future
   relative change in a nation's exposure (population or GDP) and its
   future relative change in annual average population or GDP affected by
   earthquakes. The evolution of flood hazard was quantified using a flood
   model with boundary conditions derived from five different general
   circulation models and two representative concentration pathways, and
   changes in population and GDP were quantified using two shared
   socioeconomic pathways. There is a nonlinear relationship between the
   future relative change in a nation's exposure (population or GDP) and
   its future relative change in its annual average population or GDP
   affected by floods. Six regions can be defined for positive and negative
   relative change in population that designate whether climate change can
   temper, counter, or reinforce relative changes in flood risk produced by
   changes in population or exposure. The departure from the one-to-one
   relationship between a relative change in a nation's population or GDP
   and its relative change in flood risk could be used to inform further
   efforts at flood mitigation and adaptation.
   Plain Language Summary Floods and earthquakes affect the economy and
   population of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Future
   changes in these countries' economies and population will change the
   impacts of floods and earthquakes. In addition, future changes in
   climate will change how often flooding occurs. We assume that earthquake
   occurrence won't change with climate changes. We show how much the
   economies and populations of these countries are affected by floods and
   earthquakes in 2015, 2030 and 2080. However, as we don't know for
   certain how the economies, population and climate will change in the
   future, we show result for a variety of scenarios for future economies,
   population and climate. We assess how future changes in the economy and
   population affect future flood risk using changes in earthquake risk,
   and assume the remaining change is caused by changes in climate. We
   suggest that for some countries the population affected by floods can
   increase even with a decrease in population, or the population affected
   by floods and decrease even with an increase in population, if the
   future change in flood hazard is sufficiently large.},

Abstract = {This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate health
   expenditures to demonstrate how productivity has changed over time for
   46 selected countries in Europe and Central Asia. Our results show that
   countries could have increased output by 1.2\% given the existing level
   of inputs. The patterns of efficiency change for the observed countries
   are further analyzed using the Malmquist productivity index (MPI).
   Decreased productivity growth is related to technical change. Finally,
   we regress efficiency scores on a set of environmental variables using a
   Tobit model. The positive influence of hospital beds and primary
   schooling on efficiency scores demonstrates that countries with better
   medical environments and a greater number of educational years may enjoy
   increased efficiency. In addition, there exists a regional effect
   between Europe and Central Asia. (C) 2013 Western Social Science

Abstract = {Archaeological studies of Early Islamic communities in Central Asia have
   focused on lowland urban communities. Here, the authors report on recent
   geophysical survey and excavation of an Early Islamic cemetery at
   Tashbulak in south-eastern Uzbekistan. AMS dating places the
   establishment of the cemetery in the mid-eighth century AD, making it
   one of the earliest Islamic burial grounds documented in Central Asia.
   Burials at Tashbulak conform to Islamic prescriptions for grave form and
   body deposition. The consistency in ritual suggests the existence of a
   funerary community of practice, challenging narratives of Islamic
   conversion in peripheral areas as a process of slow diffusion and
   emphasising the importance of archaeological approaches for documenting
   the diversity of Early Islamic communities.},

   gender-based violence as solely male on female, and shows the importance

Abstract = {Grounded in institutional isomorphism theory, the paper analyzes the
   extent to which the process of homogenization (isomorphism) can be
   useful in our understanding of changes within religious entities.
   Examining the emergence and development of religious entities in
   post-Soviet Tajikistan, I find that three isomorphic mechanisms are less
   dependent on the impact of religious institutional environments and
   interaction among religious organizations. Rather, isomorphic changes
   are manifested as the result of interaction with the state. Mimetic and
   normative processes are observed in a weak state, whereas coercive
   isomorphism is exerted under the influence of a strong state. A relative
   heterogeneity of the religious field is observed in the first two stages
   of the development of religious entities. Once the state expands its
   regulation and control, religious entities become more homogeneous in
   structure and administration due to coercive isomorphism. Implications
   for extending the concept of institutional isomorphism beyond
   traditional organizational fields are discussed.},

Abstract = {New economic conditions in Kyrgyzstan today demand new approaches to
   industrial development. Huge, old plants and factories built in the
   Soviet era have collapsed, increasing the country's poverty level and
   the number of jobless people, especially in mountain regions. Lack of
   finances, poor management, privatization, and the breakup of the
   centralized industrial system have led to a decline in industrial
   production in Kyrgyzstan. Industry in the Kyrgyz economy decreased from
   62\% in 1990 to 16.1\% in 2004, as a share of gross domestic product.
   This economic decline caused disparities between lowland and highland
   development, and resulted in the migration of rural populations to
   towns, especially from mountain regions isolated From the outside world.
   Under such conditions there is a great need to establish a liaison
   between lowlands and highlands. This role can be played by a network of
   new small-scale industries based on the obviously high potential of
   mountain regions. Small investments based on local natural and human
   resources, innovative approaches to national traditions, and new
   equipment, management, and marketing adapted to the demands of the modem
   market-these are essential elements of such industries now appearing in
   the Kyrgyz market, and the steps forward to creating the ``Made in
   Kyrgyzstan'{''} brand. But to what extent is this direction in
   industrial development successful and sustainable?},

Abstract = {This study assesses how the countries of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in
   Central Asia are attempting to utilize welfare reform to address the
   growing concerns around wealth inequality. Specifically, it seeks to
   better understand citizen support for welfare services within these two
   countries and how cultural aspects of these two societies have shaped
   the welfare reform dialogue and service planning processes. The authors
   used nationally representative data from Life in Transition surveys
   (LiTS) conducted in 2010 (N = 1,000 in Kazakhstan; N = 1,016 in
   Kyrgyzstan) and 2015 (N = 1,505 in Kazakhstan; N = 1,500 in Kyrgyzstan)
   by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The study
   performs empirical testing of hypotheses of welfare support based on
   theories of self-interest, reciprocity, and Muslim identity. Findings
   indicate that: (a) the use of public services increased the support for
   welfare programs; (b) personal encounters with bribing reduced the
   support for welfare over time; and (c) the Muslim identity increased the
   willingness to pay more taxes among citizens for such services. Future
   studies should include assessing the religiousness and Zakat-related
   adherence of Muslim respondents.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Central Asia exports large amounts of virtual water through agricultural
   trade, a key factor for overexploitation of water resources in the
   region. Most studies analyze Central Asia's virtual water outflows to
   the outside world, while ignore the agricultural trade within the region
   and the varying impacts of virtual water flows on the individual
   countries. In this study, the changes in virtual water flows embedded in
   trade with outside regions (external) and Central Asia countries
   (internal) were analyzed for the period 2000-2018 for wheat, cotton, and
   livestock. The results show that while Central Asia exported,
   respectively, 194.3 and 101.8 km(3) of virtual water to the outside
   world through cotton and wheat trade, it imported 53.7 km(3) of virtual
   water via livestock trade. Also, while cotton-based virtual water
   outflows decreased, wheat-based virtual water outflows increased. Total
   virtual water flows in internal trade reached 71.2 km(3), with flow
   originating mainly from Kazakhstan and heading to other four countries
   through wheat trade.Kazakhstan was the largest net exporter of virtual
   water through wheat trade, Uzbekistan was the second-largest net
   exporter through cotton trade. Green water (precipitation water used by
   crops) was dominant in virtual water flow related to wheat and blue
   water (surface water or groundwater used by crops) was dominant in
   virtual water flow related to cotton. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were
   most directly influenced by the virtual water trade.},

Abstract = {In countries emerging from authoritarian rule, a major challenge is
   ending often widespread and systematic torture and ill-treatment
   practices. Between 2011 and 2019, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), in
   collaboration with the Open Society Foundation (OSF), the Open Society
   Justice Initiative (OSJI) and regional and local partners, worked to
   establish effective torture investigation and documentation practices in
   the Central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan.
   Our approach consisted of activities in three sequential phases - (1)
   assessment, (2) capacity building, and (3) policy reform. In this paper,
   we briefly describe activities during each phase and identify key
   lessons learned from these experiences and resulting policy and program
   reforms as a model for future efforts in other settings.},

Abstract = {What explains the dynamics of contentious collective political action in
   post-Soviet Central Asia? How do post-Soviet Central Asian citizens
   negotiate the tensions between partaking in and abstaining from
   elite-challenging collective protests? By analysing cross-national
   attitudes in two Central Asian states, this article (1) systematically
   analyses the variation in collective protests by testing rival macro-,
   meso-, and micro-level theories; (2) reintroduces a conceptual and
   empirical distinction between low-risk and high-risk collective
   protests; and (3) examines the conditions under which individuals
   participate in two distinct types of elite-challenging collective
   actions. Three conclusions are reached. First, the evidence suggests
   that nuanced consideration of multi-level theoretical perspectives is
   necessary to explain contingencies of elite-challenging actions. Second,
   economic grievances and resource mobilization emerge as leading factors
   driving both low-risk and high-risk protests. Third, Islamic religiosity
   and social networking robustly predict participation in high-risk
   collective action.},

Title = {Development of agricultural land markets in countries in Eastern Europe
   and Central Asia},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Well-functioning agricultural land markets are a precondition for
   agricultural and rural development in general. However, agricultural
   land markets remain weak and still face many constraints in Eastern
   Europe and Central Asia. By applying a conceptual framework for
   agricultural land market development in five stages, the paper assesses
   the current development stage of land markets in countries in Eastern
   Europe and Central Asia and discusses the main constraints including
   informalities, absent owners, technical errors and complicated and
   costly land transaction procedures. Most of the countries have farm
   structures characterized by excessive land fragmentation and small
   average farm sizes. The need for coherent national land policies is
   argued. Furthermore, land management instruments such as land
   consolidation and land banking in addition to facilitating agricultural
   and rural development also contribute to land market development.},

Title = {Performance and Capital Structure of Microfinance Institutions in
   Eastern Europe and Central Asia},
Journal = {EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {395-419},
Abstract = {Recent trends in microfinance, such as commercialization and deposit
   mobilization, highlight the importance of investigating the link between
   sources of funds and performance by microfinance institutions (MFIs).
   This article estimates the joint impact of seven categories of capital
   on three dimensions of performance, using a seemingly unrelated
   regressions (SUR) method and panel data from MFIs in Eastern Europe and
   Central Asia during the period 2005-2009. The results suggest that
   performance is influenced by the preferences of the stakeholders who
   provide the capital. Grants are associated with a better depth of
   outreach. Concessional loans are useful in improving outreach without
   affecting financial results. Loans from social investors are related to
   a lower return on assets but also an improvement in outreach to
   lower-income clientele. The evidence regarding the influence of savings
   on financial performance is less clear, but the results are interpreted
   to mean that savings should be encouraged to serve the needs of the poor
   as well as to lower the cost of capital.},

   problems in Central Asia},
Journal = {SPRINGERPLUS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Central Asia is one of the regions that suffer the most prominent
   transboundary water and energy problems in the world. Effective
   transboundary water-energy resource management and cooperation are
   closely related with socioeconomic development and stability in the
   entire Central Asia. Similar to Central Asia, Northwest China has an
   arid climate and is experiencing a water shortage. It is now facing
   imbalanced supply-demand relations of water and energy resources. These
   issues in Northwest China and Central Asia pose severe challenges in the
   implementation of the Silk Road Economic Belt strategy. Based on the
   analysis of water and energy distribution characteristics in Central
   Asia as well as demand characteristics of different countries, the
   complexity of local transboundary water problems was explored by
   reviewing corresponding historical problems of involved countries,
   correlated energy issues, and the evolution of inter-country
   water-energy cooperation. With references to experiences and lessons of
   five countries, contradictions, opportunities, challenges and strategies
   for transboundary water-energy cooperation between China and Central
   Asia were discussed under the promotion of the Silk Road Economic Belt
   construction based on current cooperation conditions.},

   (real GDP per capita, life expectancy, consumer price index),
   infrastructure (passenger transportation volume), security (total
   recorded crimes), and the environment (CO2 emissions). We used a time
   series-univariate ARIMA model to forecast the inbound tourism in the
   Republic of Uzbekistan, and applied the ARDL model to assess the impact
   of lagged real GDP per capita on inbound tourism in both the short and
   long terms. The results of our research show that security and welfare
   significantly affect the inflow of foreign tourists in the country,
   along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the effects of

Abstract = {This paper endeavours to delve into how, despite the efforts made by
   Russian and Soviet scholars, before and during the Soviet era, many
   aspects of Ismailism are yet to be adequately studied within the context
   of Central Asia. One such aspect is the role of the religious leaders,
   specifically, the hierarchy of the religious authorities - the hudud
   al-din - within the Ismaili tariqa. The Ismaili hierarchy served as a
   tool in maintaining and providing advice on religious matters for the
   murids (followers) and on socio-political issues within the Ismaili
   community. However, due to the risk of being persecuted, the Ismaili
   religious leaders and religious authorities lived out of sight,
   compelled to hide their identity, and revealing their status to only a
   few representatives. By examining the scholarly findings of Wladimir
   Ivanow, Henry Corbin, Andrei Bertel's and Farhad Daftary, and with the
   help of important Ismaili manuscripts discovered in the Badakhshan
   region of Tajikistan during the Soviet era, this study will investigate
   how, particularly in Central Asia, the hudud al-din were structured and
   how their role and function served the Ismaili community which lived
   amid the hostile milieu of the Sunni majority.},

Abstract = {Religion and ethnicity are inextricably linked in discourse within and
   about Central Asia. One common narrative suggests that as a result of
   differences between historically sedentary and nomadic populations,
   ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks are naturally more religious and more likely to
   radicalize than their Kazakh and Kyrgyz neighbors. Using extensive data
   available from the Pew Research Center's 2012 The World's Muslims
   survey, this study examines whether such claims stand up to empirical
   scrutiny. The data cast doubt on simplified versions of this discourse
   and suggest that future analyses should focus attention on
   individual-level explanations rather than potentially essentializing
   group-based narratives.},

Abstract = {The development and use of water resources in the Amu Darya Basin remain
   under debate in the face of increasing population and associated
   scarcities in water, food, and energy. The upstream riparian, the
   mountain nation of Tajikistan, wishes to develop its hydropower
   potential. Three downstream states wish to sustain or increase their
   economic benefits from water used for irrigation. Growing tensions among
   the riparian countries on the Vakhsh River, a tributary of Amu Darya,
   have halted development of Tajikistan's proposed Rogun Dam. This paper
   examines the potential for mutually beneficial water development and
   allocation of water resources to sustain demands for water, food, and
   energy. Using long-term data on the Basin's energy potential, water
   supplies, irrigated land, and crop water demands, this paper analyzes
   total economic welfare for a future 20-year time horizon. Two water
   supply scenarios for each of two policy choices are examined. Results
   show that a constrained economic optimization operation of the Dam has
   the potential to increase farm income for each riparian country, while
   producing considerable benefits in hydropower for Tajikistan. Political
   negotiation among the riparian states and much better data will be
   needed to discover and implement potential gains indicated by this
   study.},

Abstract = {Managerial ties are an area commanding managers' attention in emerging
   economies. However, no previous study has drawn on cross-country data to
   address a crucial question: Are more developed market-supporting
   institutions associated with less use of managerial ties in emerging
   economies? Further, to strive for better performance, firms also need to
   develop market-based strategic initiatives. How do these initiatives
   impact performance? What role do managerial ties play in the
   relationship? Addressing these questions, this article extends research
   on managerial ties in emerging economies to an underexplored
   region-Central Asia and the Caucasus.},

Abstract = {Much recent scholarship has seen Soviet Central Asia as directly
   comparable to the overseas colonies of modern European states. In this
   article, Adeeb Khalid takes issue with this trend. European colonial
   rule, he argues, was predicated on the perpetuation of difference, while
   the Soviets sought to conquer it. Central Asia was indeed subject to
   colonial rule in the tsarist period, but its transformation in the early
   Soviet period was the work, instead, of a different kind of polity-an
   activist, interventionist, mobilizational state that sought to transform
   its citizenry. Khalid compares the transformations of the early Soviet
   period in Central Asia with the reforms of the early republic in Turkey,
   which were strikingly similar in intent and scope. This comparative
   perspective brings out the substantial differences between colonial
   empires and modern mobilizational states; confusing the two can only
   lead to a fundamental misunderstanding of modern history.},

Abstract = {The paper addresses problems of water resource management on the

   district water organizations are responsible for equitable water
   distribution to the agricultural users. These organizations do not have
   the necessary logistical capacities to manage the water resources nor to
   control water utilization at the local level. Over-extraction and the
   lack of control are leading to common pool resource problems at the
   district level. Furthermore, the concept of administrational management
   of water resources at the district level, instead of hydrological
   management increases the problems of equitable water distribution on the
   provincial, national, and international level.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2020},

Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {In this article I argue that the renewed promotion of the Manas epic in
   Kyrgyzstan after 2010 should not be reduced to an attempt to consolidate
   a national identity or strengthen the state by endorsing
   ethno-nationalism. Instead, since the 2009 inscription of the Manas epic
   on the UNESCO List of Intangible Heritage by China, Kyrgyzstan has
   undertaken a full-scale heritagization not only of the Manas epic but
   also of its other tangible or intangible cultural assets. This
   heritagization has been shaped by an anxiety that Kyrgyzstan's most
   valuable cultural asset might be appropriated by China. By shifting the
   focus from Manas as a potential national role model to the epic as
   national heritage, I suggest that Kyrgyzstan's latest outburst of
   `Manasification' is better understood as an attempt to resist China's
   ongoing attempts to harness the heritage discourse in rewriting the
   cultural and historical narrative of Eurasia.},

   one) or ended a relationship. Although each encounter is unique, all
   involve people who are mobile, coming from communities of varied
   positions within global hierarchies. These encounters challenge standard
   assumptions about the relationship between exchange and social cohesion,
   and offer insight into the complex ways people figure relatedness in a
   world increasingly characterized by blurred boundaries and economic
   polarization. (Gift exchange, hospitality, globalization, former Soviet

Abstract = {Water is needed mostly in summer time for irrigation and in winter time
   for generation of electric power. This results in conflicts between
   downstream countries that utilize water mostly for irrigation and those
   upstream countries, which use water for generation of electric power. At
   present Uzbekistan is blocking railway connection that is going to
   Tajikistan to interfere to transportation of the equipment and materials
   for construction of Rogun hydropower plant. In order to avoid conflicts
   between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan a number of measures for the
   utilization of water resources of the trans-boundary Rivers Amu-Darya
   and Sir-Darya are discussed. In addition, utilization of water with the
   supplement of wind and solar energy projects for proper and efficient
   management of water resources in Central Asia; export-import exchanges
   of electric energy in summer and winter time between neighboring
   countries; development of small hydropower project, modern irrigation
   system in main water consuming countries and large water reservoir
   hydropower projects for control of water resources for hydropower and
   irrigation are also discussed. It is also concluded that an effective
   management of water resources can be achieved by signing Water treaty
   between upstream and downstream countries, first of all between
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In this paper management of water as
   renewable energy resource in Tajikistan and Central Asian Republics are
   presented. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   evidence from Kyrgyzstan using data from three household surveys
   collected in 1993, 1998 and 2011. We find that Kyrgyzstan, like Eastern
   European middle-income transition economies, maintained high educational
   mobility, comparable to levels during the Soviet era. However, we find
   that the younger cohorts, exposed to the transition during their school
   years, experienced a rapid decline in educational mobility. We also
   document that gender differences in schooling and educational mobility,
   found among older-aged individuals, disappeared in the younger cohorts.},

   international actors and in accordance with nation-building priorities,
   Soviet-era medical and societal security framings gradually transformed
   into state security, demography and family-oriented framings. It also
   examines the resulting policy responses and practices that influence the
   everyday life of social groups who become identified as a public health

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of social assistance on subjective
   well-being looking at the case of Kyrgyzstan. For this purpose, we
   exploit recent changes in the design of social assistance and apply a
   difference in difference (DiD) method combined with an inverse
   probability weighting (IPW) technique. In contrast to the existing
   literature, we find that in the short-term, the receipt of social
   assistance benefits is associated with lower levels of subjective
   well-being. Our findings also reveal that participation in social
   assistance leads to some reduction in satisfaction regarding recipients'
   own economic conditions. Moreover, we find that the negative effects on
   subjective well-being disappear for the oldest generations, which
   experienced the dissolution of the Soviet Union. By contrast, the effect
   is negative for the youth, who grew up in a new society where needing
   help is ultimately the responsibility of the individual citizen. For
   individuals with high trust in political institutions, the negative
   effect of state intervention does not hold, while it persists in case of
   low trust in political institutions.},

Journal = {FEMINIST ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Patrilocal marriage - living in the husband's natal household - affects
   Central Asian women and their choices in family planning, labor force
   participation, and human capital investment. While anthropological
   evidence suggests that elder household members play a key role in the
   lives of junior women, empirical studies are scarce. This study uses
   Tajikistan's 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (TJDHS) to explore the
   link between domestic violence and the living arrangements of
   daughters-in-law (DILs). Controlling on observables, propensity score
   matching (PSM) generates a positive treatment effect: women living with
   in-laws are far more likely to experience emotional abuse by their
   husbands. Treatment effects do not emerge between physical violence and
   in-laws' presence. Results show that these DILs are about 3.6 times more
   likely than those living in nuclear households to experience emotional
   abuse regardless of the presence of the father-in-law, leading to the
   conclusion that responsibility can be plausibly ascribed to the
   mother-in-law.},

Abstract = {In Tajikistan, a Central Asian country with high rates of emigration,
   there is little systematic empirical research on the education of
   children in transnational households. In this study, I use national
   representative data from 2011 to examine the number of years lag in
   education of boys (N=1110) and girls (N=1140) aged 7 to 17 who live in
   different transnational care arrangements compared with those living in
   non-migrant households. I demonstrate that being in a transnational
   household reduces the risk of an educational lag, although there are
   gender differences when measuring this relationship. In particular,
   girls are less likely to have an educational lag if the mother or both
   parents migrate, if the duration of parental absence is shorter rather
   than longer, and if migrants send remittances home. The legal status of
   parents abroad and maternal migration are advantageous for boys'
   education. These findings highlight the importance of looking at complex
   transnational forms of living and at gender when assessing the
   educational outcomes of children in migrant sending contexts.},

Abstract = {Vocational education and training (VET) can contribute to the attainment
   of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. A key to economic
   and social progress is the training of better-qualified individuals and
   skilled enterprise staff who will be more productive, improving goods,
   increasing incomes and adapting to changing markets. Experts from
   international cooperation agencies see VET projects as suitable
   instruments for poverty alleviation in target groups working in the
   informal sector and rural economy. The recent shortages and high prices
   of rural products in many developing countries support this position.
   For the past two years a skills development for poverty reduction (SDPR)
   project has been running in rural areas of Central Asia to address rural
   poverty. The approach and findings of the project are discussed against
   the background of the international debate on VET in the context of
   poverty alleviation. It is hoped that the conclusions will contribute to
   optimising the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
   similar VET projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {How is migration related to informal activities? They may be
   complementary since new migrants may have difficulty finding employment
   in formal work, so many of them end up informally employed.
   Alternatively, migration and informality may be substitutes since
   migrants' incomes in their new locations and income earned in the home
   informal economy (without migration) are an imperfect trade-off.
   Tajikistan possesses both a very large informal sector and extensive
   international emigration. Using the gap between household expenditure
   and income as an indicator of informal activity, we find negative
   significant correlations between informal activities and migration: the
   gap between expenditure and income falls in the presence of migration.
   Furthermore, Tajikistan's professional workers' ability to engage in
   informal activities enables them to forgo migration, while low-skilled
   nonprofessionals without postsecondary education choose to migrate
   instead of working in the informal sector. Our empirical evidence
   suggests migration and informality substitute for one another.},

Abstract = {Today the Internet is the easiest way to find information about any kind
   of organization, and the first impression about an organization is
   almost always based on its Web site. This study investigated whether the
   Web sites of the universities in the Kyrgyz Republic comply with
   prevailing standards of accessibility and usability and whether these
   qualities depend on location and type of ownership of the universities.
   The analysis was conducted using online evaluation tools. Based on the
   data collected, the hypotheses were further tested using the SPSS
   statistical package. The results show a low usability rating for the
   vast majority of the universities' Web sites. For 90.47 \% of the Web
   sites upload time exceeds 30 s; 52.38 \% of the Web sites have broken
   links; and 100 \% have browser compatibility problems. The results of
   accessibility tests show low compliance with W3C-WCAG 1.0: error rates
   for Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints of 83.33, 92.85, and 95.24 \%,
   respectively. The results obtained and the results of an independent t
   test indicate that most of the issues of all Web sites tested are not of
   a technical nature, and occur mainly due to human factors related to Web
   application development.},

Abstract = {During the Cold War, Sharaf Rashidov became a representative of the

   of political, economic, social and cultural development for newly
   independent countries emerging from decolonization. Tashkent hosted
   important meetings among Soviet and Asian leaders, along with
   international festivals of cinema and literature, which attracted
   hundreds of Asian, African and Latin American intellectuals, writers,
   poets, journalists, trade unionists and athletes. Moreover, Uzbekistan
   came to symbolize the self-proclaimed compatibility between communism
   and Islam, offering a facade of religious freedom, tolerance and
   tradition combined with Bolshevik progress. The Soviet invasion of
   Afghanistan discredited this narrative - and Uzbekistan and
   (posthumously) Rashidov were humiliated in the Cotton Affair - pointing
   to the impact as well as the limits of Uzbek internationalism.},

Journal = {POLITICS GROUPS AND IDENTITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {764-784},
Abstract = {This article, which offers a new theoretical explanation of the violence
   between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks that emerged in southern Kyrgyzstan in 2010,
   explores the importance of historical legacies through structure and
   grievance-based theoretical approaches to conflict. In so doing, it
   argues that structural violence born in the pre-Soviet era fueled the
   1990 riots, persisted and generated contradictions for Osh Kyrgyz and
   Osh Uzbeks during the Soviet and post-Soviet eras, and ultimately caused
   the 2010 riots. The article draws on existing scholarship, primary
   sources, Russian-language newspapers, and data collected during
   fieldwork in Osh. Its main contribution is to further develop the
   theoretical literature on conflict by showing that economic and
   demographic horizontal inequalities can be just as explosive as
   political inequalities. The article concludes with a discussion of what
   persisting contradictions and post-conflict coping strategies reveal
   about contemporary social dynamics and future conflict in the region.},

Abstract = {Because the decision to migrate is a product of gendered negotiations
   within households, households formed through forced marriage may have
   different migration strategies than households formed through voluntary
   marriage. In Kyrgyzstan, we anticipate two possible effects of the
   traditional practice of bride kidnapping on migration. Households headed
   by a kidnap couple may be more cohesive and patriarchal, facilitating
   men's labour migration and remittance-sending. Alternately, women may
   use migration to escape such households. We test these two hypotheses
   using a sample of 1,171 households in rural Kyrgyzstan. Kidnap
   households are more likely to include women migrants, compared to other
   households. Kidnap households are also more likely to be receiving
   remittances, even when controlling for migrant household members.
   However, traditional beliefs about kidnapping are negatively associated
   with men's and women's migration. While higher levels of remittance
   receipt among kidnap households resembles the unified, patriarchal
   households envisioned in the New Economics of Labour Migration, it also
   appears that women use labour migration as a means to escape patriarchal
   constraints. We demonstrate that forced marriage in Kyrgyzstan plays a
   larger social role than is often believed, and highlight a new pathway
   through which gendered power dynamics can shape household migration
   strategies.},

   are regarded as possessing spiritual knowledge that links them to God.
   The social and religious environment in which the otuns function has
   been influenced by the revival of Islam, particularly in that the new
   transnational landscape has strengthened links with the rest of the
   Islamic world and introduced a trend toward the purification of Islam of
   local practices and traditions. More contemporaneously, the Tajik
   authorities are also having an impact as they attempt to exercise
   control over female religious leaders.},

Abstract = {Local ownership is one of the popular paradigms of Western development
   aid. It involves giving more effective control of the design and
   implementation of development aid to local actors in aid-receiving
   countries, including governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   and local communities. This article contrasts the understanding of local
   ownership as a top-down process triggered by donors, with an
   alternative, bottom-up ownership, which emerges spontaneously on the
   ground. By looking at the case of a local NGO in post-Soviet Tajikistan,
   the article analyses practices which reveal how the NGO actively takes
   ownership of development aid through everyday work. This includes
   fundraising, structuring relations with other organizations competing
   for donor funding, selecting calls for proposals from NGOs and writing
   grant applications. Each of these activities involves negotiations of
   the goals and scope of development work, against parameters imposed by
   donors. By means of example, the article questions the application of
   the local ownership paradigm in development work.},

Abstract = {Many people live in patrilocal societies, which prescribe that women
   move in with their husbands' parents, relieve their in-laws from
   housework, and care for them in old age. This arrangement is likely to
   have labor market consequences, in particular for women. We study the
   effect of coresidence on female labor supply in Kyrgyzstan, a strongly
   patrilocal setting. We account for the endogeneity of coresidence by
   exploiting the tradition that youngest sons usually live with their
   parents. In both OLS and IV estimations, the effect of coresidence on
   female labor supply is negative and insignificant. This finding is in
   contrast to previous studies, which found positive effects in less
   patrilocal settings. We go beyond earlier work by investigating effect
   channels. In Kyrgyzstan, coresiding women invest more time in elder care
   than women who do not coreside, and they do not receive parental support

   gravitation toward student-centered pedagogy than previously assumed.
   The study also identified broad use of digital downloads as learning

Abstract = {The paper aims to describe the potential in building up the economic
   base of agricultural cooperation development in the Kyrgyz Republic, to
   propose an organisational and economic mechanism of cooperative
   relations in the Kyrgyz Republic, taking into account the complex
   development of agricultural production, logistics infrastructure and
   cooperation. Cooperation is viewed as an efficient economic mechanism to
   integrate small agricultural producers into the commodity distribution
   systems in the domestic and international agricultural food markets.
   Building on a review of sources describing the potential of cooperation
   in the modern environment, analyses of the agrarian structure and
   assessments of the economic base of cooperation, the paper proposes an
   organisational structure to navigate through the development of an
   effective agrarian structure, logistics infrastructure and cooperation
   in the Kyrgyz Republic.
   The paper is based on the materials from international development
   organisations, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic
   and the findings of some researchers. The makings of the paper may be
   helpful summarising the international practice of development of
   cooperative relations, enhancement of institutional conditions and
   public policies of support of cooperation in the Kyrgyz Republic and
   should be of interest for a wide research audience in the area of
   agricultural cooperation.},

Journal = {CENTRAL ASIAN SURVEY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-92},
Abstract = {Based on research in Russian and Kazakhstani archives, this article
   investigates connections between policies of peasant colonization, the
   sedentarization of pastoral nomadic peoples, and the economic
   regionalization of the USSR. After analysing debates from the 1920s, and
   limited sedentarization among Kazakhs and Kyrgyz during
   collectivization, the article argues that only by focusing on the
   economic regionalization of Central Asia, which placed the Kazakhs and
   the Kyrgyz in two different economic regions with dissimilar priorities,
   is it possible to explain the radically different outcomes of early
   Stalinist policies for similar pastoral peoples. The increased central
   control brought by the Stalinist Great Turn created a new spatial
   hierarchy directly connecting the bottom of the Soviet social and
   spatial pyramid, the livestock-breeding regions, to its top, the elite
   regime cities. The exclusion of the Kyrgyz ASSR from the massive
   livestock procurements that fed the Soviet political and industrial
   centres, and which led to the great famine in Kazakhstan (1931-33), can
   be explained by early Stalinist economic regionalization.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE FAMILY STUDIES},

Volume = {51},

Pages = {154-187},
Abstract = {We analyze couples' time-use diaries from the 2012-2013 Life in
   Kyrgyzstan data. Using the pooled Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method,
   we test the relative resources, time availability, absolute resources,
   and gender-centered frameworks in their ability to explain gender
   differences in housework participation among Kyrgyzstani women and men.
   The results show that among the three resource-based approaches, the
   time availability models are the most potent in accounting for the
   gender gap in housework, followed by the relative resources framework.
   Both frameworks emphasize household bargaining processes and power
   differentials between spouses. The findings suggest that among
   Kyrgyzstani couples, partners' time availability and, with it,
   bargaining power play an important role in the division of housework
   tasks. In contrast, absolute resources can account only for a small
   portion of the gender differences in housework participation.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In 2003, the residential sector of Uzbekistan has consumed about 15.073
   Mtoc (million ton of oil equivalent) of energy or 27.3\% of the total
   energy consumed in the country. This value is approximately twice as
   much as that of residential sector of Turkey and Romania. The climate of
   above countries is comparable to that of Uzbekistan. In this article we
   suggest to use the heating degree-day method for determining the natural
   gas consumption norms for residential heating. Taking the climatic
   differences into account, the norms of natural gas consumption in
   respect to each resident are submitted for each region of Uzbekistan.
   The realization of suggested proposals allows saving about 9.2 billion
   m(3) of natural gas annually. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Central Asian republics as simply a Soviet project and hence,
   ultimately, a Soviet imposition. In doing so, Khalid claims, we ignore
   longer-term trends in the historical imagination of Central Asia's
   modernist intellectuals and the purchase that the ideas of nation and
   progress had on their minds. Central Asians did not come to the
   revolution of 1917 with a blank slate. Rather, their societies were in
   the midst of intense debates about the future. The revolution
   radicalized preexisting projects of cultural reform that interacted in
   multiple ways with the Bolshevik project. One result of this interaction
   was the creation of Uzbekistan. The document published in the
   ``Archive{''} section illustrates this argument by highlighting specific
   language and contradictions embedded in the Jadids' ``Chaghatayist{''}
   view of Uzbekness.},

Abstract = {Uiat is a word ubiquitously spoken in Kyrgyzstan. It is hurled at
   children to stop improper behavior and thrown by adults to evaluate
   conduct. It is a relational practice that textures everyday life,
   cultivating discomfort in the body when spoken, gendering and aging
   those involved in its practice, and setting the boundaries of propriety.
   Uiat is most often translated as ``shame.{''} The earliest work on honor
   and shame in anthropology established the prevalence of shame and
   outlined its basic work as a social mechanism of control, but the
   discussion, especially when considering Muslim societies, largely died
   out. Yet shame remains a prominent practice ripe for investigation.
   Looking at uiat as a dense, knotty practice carried out over time shows
   how shaming practices, in Kyrgyzstan at least, work to exert control and
   why they are so very efficacious. {[}shame, material semiotics, gender,

Abstract = {Using data from the 2011 and 2016 Life in Kyrgyzstan surveys, we examine
   Kyrgyz women's labour supply elasticities at the extensive margin. We
   use Heckman's two-step approach to predict earnings for the
   non-participating women and then use these predictions to estimate the
   participation equation. We find that women's labour supply decision is
   not influenced by their earnings. We also show that there exists a
   significant gap in employment propensities among ethnic Kyrgyz women in
   consensual or arranged marriages compared to women in kidnappedbased
   marriages. This finding suggests that the practice of bride abduction
   adversely affects women's probability of employment and might have
   negative consequences on their economic well-being.},

Abstract = {This article appraises the Central Asian Countries' Initiative on Land
   Management (CACILM) as an innovative experience of regional co-operation
   to implement the Convention on Desertification. Despite high initial
   expectations, the actual implementation process has suffered drawbacks.
   The Central Asian countries' commitment and capacity to sustain this
   process depends heavily on international support. Moreover, the
   process's low political profile and the weak capacities of the Central
   Asian authorities to engage in meaningful transnational co-operation are
   significant hurdles to be tackled. At the same time, national and
   regional efforts to combat soil degradation and desertification have not
   yet been properly mainstreamed with other more consolidated processes
   for the sustainable management of natural resources, such as the IFAS.
   It is argued that this may be a possible solution for the future of
   CACILM.},

Abstract = {Application of water productivity analysis can provide clues in the
   search for solutions to solve water management problems of central Asia.
   It is in this context that this paper provides an analysis of water
   productivity both spatially and temporally in the cotton and rice
   production areas of Syr Darya Basin of central Asia. The spatial
   analysis includes different farm types and basin segments, and the
   temporal analysis includes 3 hydrological years during 1999-2001. The
   analysis of temporal data showed that in water-deficient years, water
   productivity, both in terms of supply and evapotranspiration, is higher
   than the same in water-abundant years. The data also show that type and
   size of farms have an impact on water productivity in the case of both
   cotton and rice. This study concludes by suggesting strategies and
   options for enhancing the average water productivity both in the cotton-
   and rice-growing areas of the Syr Darya Basin.},

Title = {Does Renewable Energy Sector Affect Industrialization-CO2 Emissions
   Nexus in Europe and Central Asia?},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Current research assesses the impact of industrialization and the
   renewable energy sector on greenhouse gas emissions, proxied by CO2
   emissions in Europe and Central Asia. We rely on a two-step system GMM
   estimator on a sample of 48 countries over the period 2000-2018.
   Empirical results show that industrialization has a positive effect on
   CO2 emissions: a 10\% increase in industry value added as \% of GDP
   leads to an increase of 2.6\% in CO2 emissions. In contrast, renewable
   energy mitigates CO2 emissions. Ten percentage points increase in
   renewable energy consumption reduces CO2 emissions per capita by 2.2\%.
   The interaction term between renewable energy and industry value added
   is negative, suggesting that renewable energy consumption compensates
   for the negative effect of industrialization on environmental quality.
   Our main results also confirm the U-shaped inverted relationship between
   GDP per capita and CO2 emissions. Our study has a number of policy
   implications and avenues for future research.},

Title = {Development and utilization of water resources and assessment of water
   security in Central Asia},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {240},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The utilization of water resources and water security in Central Asia
   are critical to the stability of the region. This paper assesses the
   water security of the five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by using the
   projection pursuit model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO-PEE).
   The results show that the average annual water consumption in Central
   Asia is about 1255.57 x 10(8) m(3), and the proportion of agricultural
   water consumption decreased due in large part to the changes of crop
   planting structure. For the ecological security, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan
   and Kyrgyzstan have improved their status, but Turkmenistan is getting
   worse. For the quantity security of water resources, Tajikistan and
   Kyrgyzstan are relatively safe, whereas Uzbekistan is at risk. For the
   socio-economic conditions, Kazakhstan scored the highest, while
   Tajikistan and Uzbekistan scored the lowest, water consumption per
   10,000 dollars of GDP across all five countries is relatively high but
   shows a significant decreasing trend. For the water supply and demand
   security, the status of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are better
   than that of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan has achieved a
   relatively safe level (level II) and the degree of water security is
   high. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan are only in the basically
   safe level (level III). Uzbekistan is under significant pressure with
   regard to water security (level IV), which indicates that the country
   needs to strictly control population growth and strengthen the
   comprehensive management of water resources.},

Title = {Long- and short-term determinants of water user cooperation:
   Experimental evidence from Central Asia},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {10-25},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study contributes to the understanding of long- and short-term
   determinants of cooperation among water users. We experimentally
   investigate the potential of water users' self-governance in enhancing
   their contributions to a common pool as opposed to external regulation.
   Our focus is on the irrigated areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Due to
   their Soviet past, these countries have a reputation for low bottom-up
   cooperation potential. Based on the different pre-Soviet irrigation
   traditions of the two study sites, we assess the effectiveness of
   short-term incentives compared to long term cultural factors of
   cooperation. History might matter, but we find it does not predetermine
   the success of current water decentralization in ancient as compared to
   relatively recently established irrigation sites. Our study reveals that
   external regulation, in fact, decreases farmers' cooperation, whereas
   face-to-face communication increases it. This finding calls into
   question the top-down approach prevalent in current water policies of
   the region. Moreover, it suggests the viability of endogenous
   cooperation and hence encourages the implementation of truly
   self-governed water management policies in Central Asia. However, the
   substantial heterogeneity in individual contributions apparent at the
   village level also signals a warning that one size-fits-all approaches
   to local cooperation are unlikely to succeed. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Title = {What explains indirect exports of goods and services in Eastern Europe

Abstract = {This paper investigates the determinants of indirect exporting, using
   firm-level data for 27 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
   Indirect exporting depends on a combination of fixed and variable trade
   cost factors. We first hypothesize that firms that perceive customs,
   transportation, crime and legal systems as severe obstacles anticipate
   higher fixed costs and are more likely to export indirectly. The second
   hypothesis is that indirect exporting tends to be a temporary strategy.
   Econometric models are used to test the first hypothesis and transition
   matrices to test the second. In particular, probit, Heckman-probit and
   fractional response models are estimated to analyse the determinants of
   the export mode and the share of indirect exports. The results indicate
   that the factors that account for the fixed cost of exporting, mainly
   affect the decision to export indirectly (extensive margin), but some of
   them also affect, to a lesser extent, the amount exported indirectly
   (intensive margin). More specifically, factors such as customs and trade
   restrictions and transportation obstacles affect the extensive margin
   only, whereas crime affects both margins. Secondly, trade agreement
   membership mainly affects trade in manufactured goods, while exchange
   rate volatility affects positively the extensive and intensive margin of
   indirect exports of services. The results also indicate that firms are
   more likely to change their status as an indirect exporter than they are
   to change their status as a direct exporter or a non-exporter, which
   provides support to the second hypothesis.},

Abstract = {The architecture of the pre-modern Islamic world broadly identifies
   itself with geometric design. In erecting buildings,
   architects-engineers of the Islamic world utilized distinct modes of
   geometric projections vital to the spatial conception of the building.
   These representations identify three modes of design drawings: plans,
   revetments/vertical surfaces, and reflected ceiling plans. This paper
   will discuss these modes of drawings and their unique role in relation
   to the architectural ``design thinking{''} traditions. Much has been
   examined regarding two-dimensional Islamic geometric patterns (girih),
   but little exists in terms of a comprehensive framework investigating
   various modes of geometric drawings in relation to formal, spatial, and
   tectonic conceptions of the architectural space. This paper fills a
   critical gap in the literature about Islamic architecture and examines
   this topic through primary resources and original pamphlets.},

Abstract = {Rural areas in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central
   Asia are often excluded from the fruits of economic growth. In this
   paper it is argued that this exclusion goes beyond the mere rural-urban
   divide' caused by unequal income distribution. Social exclusion,
   measured by three dimensions, exclusion from economic life, exclusion
   from social services, and exclusion from civic life and social networks,
   is captured by an innovative multidimensional exclusion index (MEI),
   developed in the Regional Human Development Report. The empirical base
   for the MEI is a set of large household surveys in six transition
   countries, Kazakhstan, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, Tajikistan, and
   Ukraine, held in the period September-November 2009, during the height
   of the economic crisis. Special emphasis is given to the location
   factor, showing that social exclusion is overall stronger in rural areas
   in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in particular caused by the stronger
   influence of the second dimension, exclusion from social services, which
   includes access and quality to public utilities.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners is a
   sufficiently serious social issue in the countries of the former Soviet
   Union to warrant focused attention and sociological research. Intimate
   partner violence (IPV) negatively impacts the health, social, and
   economic well-being of individuals, families, communities, and society
   as a whole. The objective of this study, which is based on the data from
   the Kyrgyz Republic Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2012, is
   to analyze the extent of IPV and the factors and processes that function
   as predictors of physical IPV against women in the Kyrgyz Republic. The
   results of the present research demonstrate that 26\% of the respondents
   reported less severe IPV, and 5.5\% reported severe IPV. The results
   indicate that empowerment and experiential characteristics are the risk
   factors for IPV in the Kyrgyz Republic. Age of women, number of
   children, household wealth, women employment, and community educational
   level increase the likelihood of an experience of IPV among women in the
   Kyrgyz Republic while women's equal or higher earnings and community
   support of partner's controlling behavior decrease women's vulnerability
   by 30-40\%. The findings of this study underscore the importance of the
   socioeconomic and empowerment characteristics as significant factors
   associated with IPV at the individual and community levels and thus
   support feminist and resource theories.},

Title = {China's silk road economic belt initiative in Central Asia: economic and
   security implications},
Journal = {ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {267-281},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) initiative, launched by Xi Jinping in
   2013 as the Central Asian component of the Eurasian Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI), is presented as a trade and infrastructural
   developmental initiative that benefits all to deliver stability. It
   consolidates Beijing's existing economic investments and
   security-building measures, while launching new projects to link the
   regions of Central Asia and South Asia more closely with China and
   extend the arc of security westward and develop these as a transport
   corridor linking China to Europe. This article examines the interaction
   between China's infrastructural investments and security dynamics in the
   Central Asian region, exploring why the BRI/SREB, presented by China as
   primarily as a developmental vision, is fraught with wide-ranging
   security implications. We examine the reception of China's BRI/SREB in
   Central Asia focusing on the following three dimensions: (1) the lure of
   Chinese investments which makes SREB particularly attractive for Central
   Asian countries; (2) the securitization thrust of the Silk Road
   initiative which consolidates the power of the Central Asian regimes but
   also grants considerable role to China in managing security
   arrangements; (3) elite maneuvering between the lure of Chinese
   investments and appeasing popular anxieties about China's growing
   influence. It points to the overall positive reception in the region to
   the aid and investment offered by China, while noting the variance in
   their responses based on the implications of SREB for their sovereignty
   and security and also concerns on whether the promised benefits of
   connectivity and development (a ``win-win{''} scenario) will
   materialize. The article concludes by outlining the implications of
   China's rising economic and security engagement in Central Asia and the
   close Sino-Russian partnership for European financial and security
   interests and highlights the areas of cooperation and complementarity
   between China and EU in the region.},

Title = {Pipelines and Power Lines: China, Infrastructure and the Geopolitical
   (Re)construction of Central Asia},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of pipelines and power lines in the
   (re)construction of regional energy order in Central Asia. By
   structuring and governing social relations across space, infrastructures
   are integral to region building. In Central Asia, despite the
   post-Soviet transition, Soviet infrastructures have perpetuated Russian
   control over regional energy exports, hampered Central Asian states'
   development and caused regional tension. China's construction of
   pipelines and power lines represented a renegotiation of spatial,
   economic and political relations in the region. By connecting China with
   Central Asian states, the pipelines secured an alternative source of
   energy supply for Beijing, strengthened regional states' independence
   from Russian influence, and embedded them in new structures of
   interdependent relations with the rising power. Meanwhile, by connecting
   local facilities and supplying energy to less developed areas, the
   Chinese-built pipelines and power lines enhanced Central Asian states'
   capacity, promoted integration of national territories, and reduced
   region tension over water and energy supply. Notwithstanding these
   changes, Chinese-built pipelines and power lines did not overthrow the
   existing regional order. Rather than replacing Soviet systems, they were
   additions that connected with and remained embedded in the existing
   infrastructures.},

Abstract = {Central Asia's pivotal geographical position allowed it to play an
   essential role in relations among nations of Eurasia in the Middle Ages
   as the bridge between China and Europe. Yet, during the Russian and then
   the Soviet rule in Central Asia. the region's republics had no
   independent position in international relations as foreign affairs was
   formed and managed by the central government in Moscow. The collapse of
   the Soviet Union in 1991 made salient the geopolitical, economic, and
   cultural importance of the five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
   They reemerged as independent actors in the global interstate system and
   could have played a significant role in international affairs during the
   last three decades.
   The article aims to discuss the Central Asian region's position in the
   Soviet and post-Soviet eras. It explores how Central Asia as a
   ``closed{''} region during the Soviet period changed its geopolitical
   position and became an influential actor in global affairs. In addition.
   the article addresses factors that have played important role in

Journal = {PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {China's President Xi Jinping's Central Asian tour in fall 2013 marked
   Beijing's unprecedented (re)turn to Central Asia as a lynchpin of the
   ``Silk Road Economic Belt{''} of the globally ambitious Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI). China's BRI positions Central Asia as the crucial
   nexus for the cross-regional long-distance loops of trade, investment,
   and infrastructure development. By revisiting the classical geopolitical
   theory about the original Eurasian Heartland and its contemporary
   offshoots, we extract some insights for understanding the new
   China-Central Asia transboundary regional nexus. In a double-pronged
   empirical analysis of China's development strategies regarding Central
   Asia, we examine: (1) the construction of oil and gas pipelines from
   Central Asia to transmit energy all the way to China's east coast, and
   (2) the launch and expansion of the Eurasian Railroad to transport goods
   from China's manufacturing bases in both coastal and inland regions to
   Europe and Central Asia. In synthesizing the findings from this coupled
   analysis through classical and contemporary theoretical lenses, we
   discuss how China's growing influence in Central Asia via the BRI can
   reshape the region's diverse national interests, development
   opportunities and constraints while fostering closer China-Central Asia
   bilateral cooperation across multiple national boundaries. In light of
   the analysis, we also offer an updated view and critique of the
   classical Heartland/Rimland theories and discuss how a China-centric
   ``New Great Game{''} differs from its original nineteenth century
   antecedent while pointing to similar underpinnings.},

   the European Union and the United States. Findings confirm that China
   does indeed challenge Western efforts, but in an indirect way. First,
   Chinese provision of substantial and unconditional financial assistance
   makes Western politically conditioned aid appear both ungenerous and an
   infringement of sovereignty. Second, the Shanghai Co-operation
   Organisation, inclusive of China's leadership role, creates an
   institutional means through which the (semi-)authoritarianism of member
   states is legitimized and challenges Western emphasis on democracy and
   human rights. Finally, by the power of its own example, China
   demonstrates that democracy is not a prerequisite for prosperity, the
   rule of law and social well-being.},

Abstract = {We examine constraints and opportunities to enhance adoption of

   discuss agroforestry as a sustainable land use practice to address these
   issues. We present regional-specific and -suitable agroforestry
   practices, and discuss their potential. We found that legacies from the
   previous period of central planning shape current land uses,
   institutions, infrastructure and decisions of farmers, and constrain
   development of agroforestry. By identifying opportunities and
   constraints of agroforestry, we provide recommendations for enhancing
   the use of agroforestry in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {This article provides a Muslim perspective on the eighteenth-century
   Qing conquest of Xinjiang. It explores the career of Emin Khwaja, a
   leader of the Muslim community of Turfan and the most prominent Muslim
   ally in the Qing conquest. I investigate how the notion of
   ``protection{''} (himayat in Arabic), a key concept in the Central Asian
   Muslim understanding of religious and political patronage, informed
   Emin's decision to ally himself with the Qing. I argue that Emin
   understood his alliance with the ``infidel{''} Manchu not as a
   collaboration in betrayal of Islam but as a positive policy to achieve
   security and prosperity of the Muslim community in the changing
   political and commercial environment of eighteenth-century Eurasia. Emin
   was able to build a local coalition of Muslim commercial interests for
   the support of the Qing, while promoting his standing within the
   regional political hierarchy of Muslim Central Asia.},

Abstract = {When Soviet central planners began to mechanize the cotton harvest in

   market-driven process that had begun in the United States a decade
   earlier. But despite high output of cotton-picking machines, the share
   of the crop harvested mechanically grew more slowly than in the United
   States. The factor proportions in Central Asia did not justify
   mechanization: although planners could enforce introduction of the new
   technology, investment in cotton-harvesting machines was largely a waste
   of resources. The costs of premature introduction are estimated at over
   \$1 billion in 1960s prices.},

Abstract = {The increasing practice of Islam in Tajikistan in the last few years has
   contributed to rising social and political tensions. Based on
   ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Tajikistan between May and
   October 2010, this article intends to highlight underlying religious
   tensions in Tajikistan, which, I argue, are the result of the emergence
   of conflicting voices contesting current political spaces. My intention
   is to revisit two concepts abundantly used in the religious literature.
   First, I intend to deconstruct the dichotomous relation between the
   state and society and try to uncover the power relations that lie behind
   the making, dissemination and understanding of narratives addressing the
   place of Islam in society. Second, I reconsider the categories of the
   secular and the religious by illustrating the porous character of these
   concepts in the Tajik context. I do so by providing accounts of local
   perceptions of religious politics expressed by politicians and
   bureaucrats, ordinary believers and representatives of the Islamic
   Revival Party of Tajikistan. Finally, I argue that the coexistence of
   different sets of religious and secular norms reveals that the struggle
   for political power in Tajikistan is now increasingly articulated around
   religious issues.
   L'intensification de la pratique de l'Islam au Tadjikistan depuis
   quelques annees a contribue a l'emergence de tensions politiques et
   sociales marquees. Fruit d'une recherche ethnographique effectuee de mai
   a octobre 2010, cet article propose de mettre en lumiere les tensions
   religieuses au Tadjikistan en defendant l'idee que ces tensions sont
   liees a l'apparition de voix conflictuelles contestant les espaces
   politiques actuels. Mon intention est de revisiter deux concepts
   largement utilises dans la litterature religieuse. J'entends
   premierement deconstruire la relation dichotomique entre l'etat et la
   societe et degager les relations de pouvoir qui se cachent derriere la
   creation, dissemination et comprehension des narratifs qui traitent de
   la place de l'Islam dans la societe. Deuxiemement, je revisite les
   categories du religieux et du seculier et demontre le caractere poreux
   de ces concepts dans le contexte tadjik en m'appuyant sur des narratifs
   revelant les perceptions locales de la politique religieuse telles
   qu'exprimees par des politiciens et bureaucrates, croyants ordinaires et
   representants du Parti de la renaissance islamique du Tadjikistan.
   Enfin, je soutiens que la coexistence de diverses normes religieuses et
   seculieres revele que la lutte pour le pouvoir politique s'articule de
   plus en plus autour d'enjeux religieux.},

Title = {The CO2 Emissions Drivers of Post-Communist Economies in Eastern Europe
   and Central Asia},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {CO2 emissions have become a key environmental contaminant that is
   responsible for climate change in general and global warming in
   particular. Two geographical groups of countries that previously
   belonged to the former bloc of socialist countries are used for the
   estimations of CO2 emissions drivers. The research covers such Eastern
   European countries as Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Russian
   Federation, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, and Ukraine and such
   Central Asian states as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan during the period
   1996-2018. The main goal of the research is to identify common drivers
   that determine carbon dioxide emissions in selected states. To control
   for the time fixed effects (like EU membership), random effect model was
   used for the analysis of the panel data set. Results: It is found that
   energy efficiency progress reduces per capita CO2 emissions. Thus, an
   increase in GDP by 100 USD per one ton of oil equivalent decreases per
   capita CO2 emissions by 17-64 kg. That is, the more energy-efficient the
   economy becomes, the less CO2 emissions per capita it produces in a
   group of selected post-communist economies. Unlike energy efficiency, an
   increase in GDP per capita by 1000 USD raises CO2 emissions by 260 kg
   per capita, and the richer the economy becomes, the more CO2 emissions
   per capita it generates. The increase in life expectancy by one year
   leads to an increase in CO2 emissions per capita by 200-370 kg, with
   average values of 260 kg per capita. It was found that an increase in
   agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector share (as a \% of GDP) by one
   percentage point leads to the decrease in CO2 emissions by 67-200 kg per
   capita, while an increase in industrial sector share by one percentage
   point leads to the increase in CO2 per capita emissions by 37-110 kg.
   Oil prices and foreign direct investment appeared to be statistically
   insignificant factors in a group of selected post-communist economies.
   Conclusions: The main policy recommendation is the promotion of energy
   efficiency policy and the development of green economy sectors. The
   other measures are the promotion of a less energy-intensive service
   sector and the modernization of the industrial sector, which is still
   characterized by high energy and carbon intensity.},

Abstract = {Based on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, the aim of
   this paper is to examine the relationships among per capita CO2
   emissions, per capita real GDP, per capita renewable energy consumption,
   and urbanization in a panel of five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan,
   Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) from 1992 to
   2013. For robustness checking, three estimator techniques reveal no
   evidence of inverted U-shape EKC consistently. Moreover, renewable
   energy consumption plays negative impact on emissions, while
   urbanization plays positive, significantly. The findings of
   heterogeneous panel causality suggest that there are bidirectional
   causalities; each other expect no causality from emissions to renewable
   energy. Finally, some implications, such as developing a small renewable
   energy project and sustainable urbanization and strengthening
   in-regional and out-regional cooperation, are given in this region.},

Title = {Disciplined and undisciplined repression: illicit economies and state
   violence in Central Asia's autocracies},
Journal = {POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {367-383},
Abstract = {What explains the use of disciplined repression in some autocratic
   regimes and undisciplined repression in others? Despite its relevance to
   these broader debates on authoritarianism, this question remains
   inadequately explained in conventional approaches to repression. This
   article proposes that autocrats' discipline over the use of state
   repression is a consequence of their differential control over illicit
   commercial networks. Autocratic regimes that consolidate their control
   over rents become dependent on security apparatuses to deepen and
   maintain that control. These regimes invest in and support the
   development of coercive capabilities, which leads to more disciplined
   state repression. Where autocratic regimes do not control illicit
   networks and rents, their dependence on security offices is low.
   Consequently, their investment in coercive capacity suffers, giving rise
   to patterns of undisciplined repression. This article explores the
   empirical implications of these regime trajectories through a controlled
   comparison of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, two drug transit states in
   post-Soviet Eurasia whose coercive institutions and patterns of state
   violence have developed in markedly different ways.},

Title = {Planning water-food-ecology nexus system under uncertainty: Tradeoffs
   and synergies in Central Asia},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Vicious competition for limited water resources hinders the synergetic
   and sustainable development of Central Asian countries, which further
   threatens food security and exacerbates ecological degradation. In this
   study, a copula-based bi-level decentralized programming (CBDP) method
   is developed and applied to planning water food-ecology (WFE) nexus
   system. CBDP has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different
   decision levels, analyzing synergies among multiple managers and
   reflecting joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters. Then, a
   CBDP-WFE model is formulated for Central Asia, where the upper-level
   model aims to maximize system benefit for the region (i.e.
   regional-scale), and the lower-level model involves five objectives to
   maximize five countries' benefits (i.e. national-scale) respectively.
   Totally 108 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of joint
   constraint-violation risk, agricultural irrigation efficiency, and
   ecological water demand. Results reveal that (i) improving agricultural
   irrigation efficiency can optimize the water allocation pattern as well
   as increase the system benefit; (ii) in order to restore the regional
   eco-environment, the proportion of ecological water allocation should
   increase from 7\% (of the current level) to 14.9-23.8\% (by 2050); (iii)
   water allocations to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan should be properly
   controlled especially when available water is scarce. The results are
   helpful for managers in not only making decisions of water allocation
   among multiple users and countries but also gaining insight into
   synergetic management of WFE nexus under various system conditions.},

   Central Asian States into filters that decelerate threats and accelerate

Abstract = {This article analyses the geopolitical repercussions of America's
   military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Afghan Taliban's seizure of
   power in 2021. Since the Afghan Taliban continue to disregard the
   principal terms of the 2020 Doha Agreement brokered by the United
   States,Afghanistan is descending into chaos.The Afghan Taliban is unable
   to provide ordinary Afghans with basic living necessities, lacks
   international recognition and must contend against other violent
   extremist organizations operating within the country.Thus far, the
   Central Asian republics (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) have
   exhibited varying responses to the Afghan Taliban's takeover. While the
   `Stans' are all anxious about the potential spread of radical Islam and
   a looming humanitarian crisis, the greater threat to Ashgabat, Tashkent
   and Dushanbe, as well as Bishkek and Nur-Sultan, lies with the United
   States pivoting away from Central Asia and the Russian Federation
   acquiring greater leverage over regional security issues.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to analyze the adoption and use of
   mobile banking by university students and its potential determining
   factors. This study comprises 259 completed questionnaires answered
   through an online survey method. The respondents are Mongolian
   university students who have experience in using mobile banking
   applications. Young adults rely heavily on technology and are more
   likely to adopt mobile banking applications; however, there is limited
   research on the acceptance and use of mobile banking applications among
   this cohort, particularly from the perspective of Central Asian
   developing economies. Through using the SmartPLS 3.3 software,
   confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the construct and
   structural equation modeling. The main results indicate that performance
   expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating
   conditions are the main constructs related to mobile banking technology
   acceptance; perceived security positively impacts perceived trust.
   Moreover, perceived trust is the construct of the use of mobile banking
   technology by the university students who responded to the
   questionnaire. However, the relationship between perceived risk and use
   behavior was not accepted.},

Abstract = {With US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces poised for
   a major drawdown from Afghanistan in 2014, and Russia determined to
   strengthen its influence in the ``near abroad,{''} new uncertainties
   face the volatile post-Soviet Central Asian states. Changing power
   alignments in the region will pose new challenges for the United States,
   Russia, China, and the European Union. This article assesses the
   evolving direction of great-power interaction and influence in Central
   Asia, focusing on Moscow's growing assertiveness in the region. Using a
   neoclassical realist framework, I argue that geographic, historical, and
   cultural ties; a military presence; and developing economic institutions
   favor Russia over the short term, although China is best poised to
   expand regional influence over the long run. US war weariness, budget
   constraints, and distance suggest that-barring new major terrorist

Abstract = {The five new Central Asian States that emerged from the fall of the

   the continuity of autocratic political systems is a common factor among
   them. The privileged geographical position of Central Asia as a
   mandatory step between Europe and Asia, and its fundamental role in the
   energy security of world great powers, make the region increasingly
   important within the political and economic dynamics of the current
   International System. This might be a factor of analysis that affects
   changes and configurations in the political arena.
   This paper examines the extent to which external factors influence
   domestic politics by drawing on the theoretical background of
   authoritarian regimes and democratic transition, historical liaisons
   after the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as external factors such as
   security affairs, international trade, infrastructure projects in oil
   and gas pipelines, and competence for scarce water resources in the
   region.},

Title = {Bottlenecks of hydropower development in Central Asia: Failure of aid
   coordination by development banks},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-33},
Abstract = {The Central Asian countries have abundant but unevenly distributed
   natural resources including water. The Central Asia Power System (CAPS)
   project initiated by the Asian Development Bank and the Central
   Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000)
   initiated by the World Bank are planned to catalyze trade of electricity
   in this region. However, the existing surplus of the hydropower
   generation capacity of Tajikistan in summer may only meet the
   anticipated power demand by one project. The CAPS project (to be
   completed in 2023) may monopolize the surplus in Tajikistan and the
   CASA-1000 project (to be completed later) may suffer from the shortage
   of electricity. It stems from the failure of aid coordination between
   the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. This study reveals (a)
   how the assumptions made for the CAPS and CASA-1000 projects differ, and
   (b) possible causes of the failed aid coordination. It turned out that
   (a) the officer in a development bank who is in charge of project
   development has little motivation to submit his or her project to aid
   coordination, (b) only ``geographic demarcation{''} between two projects
   was discussed and agreed upon in the aid coordination, and (c) no
   technical detail of these projects was discussed in the aid
   coordination.},

Abstract = {While the major European powers were engaged in world war, a group of
   Indian nationalists were attempting to use the conflict to work toward
   the liberation of India from British rule. One of the main players was
   M.P.T. Acharya. Having left India in 1909, he joined a group of Indian
   nationalists. In 1915, the Germans established an office in Kabul, where
   Acharya was sent by the Berlin Indian Committee. After Germany's defeat
   in the war, the Indians abandoned the Germans to try their luck with the
   Soviets, who were vying for supremacy over the British Empire in Central
   Asia. The first Soviet legation to Afghanistan, which Acharya later
   joined, arrived in Kabul in August 1919. The Soviets were hoping to
   export revolution to the Indian subcontinent, and the road to India lay
   through Afghanistan. Acharya spent two years in Central Asia working
   with a variety of Indian nationalists and with (and ultimately against)
   the Communist International; he was a founding member of the Indian
   Communist Party abroad and eventually its severest critic. Under the
   influence of his European experience, Acharya's political views
   developed from proto-Bolshevik and narrowly nationalistic to
   international anarchism and libertarianism.},

Title = {Transnational environmental activism in Central Asia: the coupling of
   domestic law and international conventions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {782-807},
Abstract = {Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, local environmental activism
   in Central Asia was widespread. While environmental activists had
   managed to create mutually beneficial alliances with the titular elite
   during the Soviet period, these alliances disintegrated as the Soviet
   successor states became increasingly integrated into the international
   system. In their place, new transnational alliances emerged between
   local environmental activists and international non-governmental
   organisations. Yet, the ensuing transnational alliances did not merely
   entail international activists exerting pressure from outside on their
   domestic governments. Rather, local environmental activists have also
   carved out a separate realm for independent political action,
   facilitated by the coupling of national law with international
   conventions. Then, over time, environmental activism has moved from
   dependent activism to interdependent activism. In order to explicate the
   ways in which the coupling of national law with international
   conventions influences environmental activism and outcomes, evidence is
   provided from petroleum development at the Karachaganak and Kashagan oil
   fields in Kazakhstan and environmental activism in Turkmenistan. In
   particular, the authors examine how the 1998 Convention on Access to
   Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to
   Justice in Environmental Matters (i.e. Aarhus Convention) has
   transformed environmental activism and domestic law in Central Asia.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {13},
Number = {15},

Abstract = {This paper examines how obstacles in access to finance, labour
   regulations, and employment quality affect employment growth and the
   permanent worker ratio at the firm level. Using firm-level data of
   11,691 firms in 33 low-income and middle-income countries in Europe and
   Central Asia, where unemployment rates are the highest worldwide, this
   paper demonstrates that access to finance and employment quality
   obstacles hinder employment growth. The paper also shows that the
   greater the obstacles in access to finance and labour regulations, the
   lower the permanent worker ratio. The findings are robust when applying
   a two-stage least-squares method to address endogeneity issues.
   Furthermore, quantile regression analysis shows that access to finance
   obstacles impede the lowest-growth firms the most and the highest-growth
   firms the least. Our results indicate that significant financial and
   regulatory reforms are needed to spur sustainable employment growth.},

Abstract = {Central Asia, the pioneering place of the `Belt and Road', is under the
   threat of prominent water issues. Based on the Gini coefficient model
   and the matching index, the amount of the total renewable water
   resources and the cultivated land area were introduced to evaluate the
   matching pattern between the water and land resources in Central Asia.
   The water problem of Kazakhstan, being the most prominent, shows low
   water resources per unit area with the highest reclamation rate. The
   matching degree for the upstream countries of the Aral Sea (Kyrgyzstan,
   Tajikistan) was better than those of the downstream countries
   (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan). The Gini coefficient in Central
   Asia was 0.32, smaller than that of the global average value (0.59). The
   overall water available for use and the matching cultivated land
   resources was reasonable. Large differences exist in the matching degree
   in water distribution and utilization among Central Asian countries. The
   matching index of water and land resources in Central Asia was 1.25,
   similar to the matching degree estimated from the Gini coefficient
   model. Moreover, rational measures are suggested to alleviate the issue
   of water and land resources matching in Central Asia.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Islamic finance signifies more than a projection of religious
   affiliation. The importance of Islamic finance is increasing in central
   Asia, both as a source of capital and as a form of post-colonial
   market-building. In central Asia, it is an important facet of the new
   phenomena of nation-branding' and a means of reinvigorating the economy.
   In identity politics, Islamic finance projects an attitude of religious
   tolerance allowing states in the region to reposition their geopolitical
   identity relative to the Islamic community. This creates a performance'
   of Islamic finance that facilitates the creation of legitimacy for the
   state. Adopting Islamic finance projects images of the state's religious
   tolerance and diversity without changing the underlying structures; it
   suggests an Islamicness' that is useful to the development and
   post-colonial goals of the state. As such, it creates opportunities for
   geopolitical alliances with Muslim countries. Economically, it appeals
   to rising financial-industrial elites seeking new
   investment-opportunities, which reduces pressure on the state to
   democratize. Meanwhile, in Russia, Islamic finance is an alternative
   source of capital for the sanctions-hit state and a useful identity
   marker with which to connect to the increasingly wary Caucuses and
   Commonwealth of Independent States countries, lending it a wider
   significance across Eurasia.},

   reduction, human well-being, and regional sustainable development. With
   the increasing demand for energy and food, environmental degradation,
   and increasing pressure on regional finite water resources,
   water-energy-food-ecology (WEFE) systems have been facing serious
   challenges in Central Asia. To address these challenges, it is necessary
   to understand and manage the WEFE nexus; thus, we explore the
   relationship between cross-sectoral pressures in this study. Based on
   the projection pursuit model and the virtual water trade concept, we
   comprehensively assess the WEFE system pressure and reveal the
   transmission of pressure. Finally, we develop a coordination mechanism
   to achieve the sustainable development of WEFE systems. The main results
   are as follows: (1) During 1992-2014, the comprehensive pressure level
   of the WEFE system showed a slightly upward trend, but there were
   significant differences between countries; (2) the pressures of
   cross-sectors are not only closely related but also transmittable.
   Unreasonable sectoral structure (crop planting, power generation and
   food import and export), spatial mismatch of resources and virtual water
   trade (especially for food trade) are important reasons for the pressure
   transfer within and across countries. And, (3) the proposed coordination
   mechanism optimizes the system structure, makes trade-offs and synergies
   for the interests of the sectors, and is more targeted. The integration
   of policies and regions is key to ensuring the smooth operation of the
   mechanism. This research can serve as a reference to achieve the
   coordinated development of WEFE systems in Central Asia.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the results of two studies of intercultural relations
   in post-Soviet Georgia and Tajikistan. These countries have in common a
   sharp decline in cultural diversity as a result of wars and conflicts,
   and this model of intercultural relations on post-Soviet space was
   identified as a post-conflict model. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate three hypotheses of intercultural relations: multiculturalism,
   contact and integration (Berry, 2017) among majority members and the
   ethnic Russian minorities. We surveyed 312 Ethnic Russians and 298
   Georgians in Georgia; 277 Ethnic Russians and 317 Tajiks in Tajikistan.
   The studies used scales from the MIRIPS questionnaire. To test the three
   hypotheses of intercultural relations we followed a Structural Equation
   Modeling (SEM) approach. The multiculturalism hypothesis found partial
   support in all four groups in Georgia and Tajikistan. The contact
   hypothesis received partial support in Tajiks and in Ethnic Russians in
   Georgia and was not supported among Ethnic Russians in Tajikistan and
   Georgians. The integration hypothesis was fully supported in Tajiks and
   Ethnic Russians in Georgia, partially supported among Ethnic Russians in
   Tajikistan and was not supported among Georgians. The results obtained
   in these two countries are discussed taking into consideration the
   sociocultural contexts and recent history of wars and conflicts.},

Pages = {1235-1240},

Abstract = {Background: In the wake of collapse of the Soviet union, Central Asia
   has transformed into a key hub along the Afghan opiates trafficking
   routes. Around 30 percent of the heroin manufactured in Afghanistan is
   estimated to be smuggled through Central Asian republics in its way to
   booming drug markets in Russia and Eastern Europe.
   Methods: Building upon available evidence and extensive fieldwork
   research, the article seeks to confute mainstream analyses which
   emphasize connections between criminal and terrorist networks. The focus
   is on conducive factors for the establishment of drug routes in Central
   Asia, the characteristics of drug related networks, and the nature of
   political-criminal relations across the region.
   Results: It is argued that in all five Central Asia republics strategic
   partnerships have formed between drug traffickers and state actors
   around the exploitation of drug rents and that mafias' influence on
   politics is stronger in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, the region's poorest
   countries.
   Conclusion: By moving the focus from narco-terror to the state-crime
   connections, the article provides a critical insight into political
   economy issues surrounding a complex and multifaceted phenomenon such as
   the drug trade. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {It has been 30 years since Central Asian `-stan' countries, namely,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan,
   declared their independence in 1991. The Republics have chosen various
   transition paths from centrally planned to the market-based economic
   system. The research found that Central Asian leaders' protectionist
   policy, on top of the landlocked geographical environment, made trade
   costly, rendering these countries further isolated. Consequently,
   economic development slows down, unemployment increases and poverty rate
   extremes. Eventually, the isolated region (relatively, excluding
   Kazakhstan) is imprisoned in a low-income trap and framed into a vicious
   circle. As a solution for tackling high-trade costs in the region, this
   paper utilises the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Computational
   General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling to simulate the impacts of
   implementing policy-targeted scenarios. The study presents that tariff
   reduction/elimination and trade facilitation policies could flourish the
   region by bringing significant economic welfare and robust GDP growth.
   The trade facilitation scenarios impact the region's economy much more
   positively than do tariff liberalisation scenarios.},

Abstract = {Recently, Israel has resuscitated its `periphery doctrine': the
   attempted circumvention of Arab hostility, by cultivating relations with
   other nearby actors. Despite the expanding literature on the periphery
   doctrine, no study has delineated Israel's contemporary relations with
   the Caucasus and Central Asia. This deficit is conspicuous, because
   earlier works noted Israel's employment of the periphery doctrine to
   create durable relations, across both regions. This assessment contrasts
   with non-regional literature, which stresses the periphery doctrine's
   limited utility. This essay therefore provides an updated assessment of
   Israel's regional ties. We argue that Israel has, in fact, failed to
   create long-term partnerships in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Thus,
   these cases illuminate the periphery doctrine's deficiencies.},

Title = {Russia's gas challenge: the consequences for China, Central Asia, Europe

Abstract = {Russia is posing a series of challenges to gas consumers and gas
   producers alike. But the effectiveness of these challenges remains a
   matter of considerable debate. Overall, prospective Russian actions and
   policies have profound implications for the development of the European
   gas market in general, and thus for potential US LNG exports to Europe.
   Moreover, underlying all this is the most worrisome question of all: do
   Russia's policies and actions enable gas consumers-and indeed, some
   Central Asian gas producers-to regard Russia as a reliable energy
   partner?
   This article therefore addresses:
   Prospects for the full implementation of the Russia-China gas accords;
   Prospects for Turkmen gas supply to both Russia and China;
   Prospects for the development of both Gazprom's Turkish Stream project
   and the EU-backed Southern Gas Corridor;
   Prospects for US LNG in Europe;
   The potential challenge that a change in Russian gas export policies
   could pose to European gas prices.
   The article also seeks to answer the question as to whether Russia can
   be considered a reliable partner, particularly in connection with
   long-term deliveries to Europe.},

Abstract = {This paper identifies the interplay between narratives on Central Asia
   as a region. It compares European Union (EU) narratives with those of
   the five post-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
   Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. By doing so, it investigates the
   manifestations of narratives, stories and narrators who continue to
   construct and convey certain discourses about the region, comparing EU
   discourse and that of the local political elites in Central Asia,
   respectively. By looking at official discourse conveyed by the
   presidents of the countries and in key foreign policy documents, the
   interplay of narratives as dialogues between narrators is analysed, thus
   expanding into ideational analysis, an emerging trend in the literature
   on post-Soviet Central Asia.},

   lands to the Tarim Basin, passing Bukhara and Kokand along the way. This
   paper by no means aims to provide a historical survey of al-Jazuli's
   prayer book in Central Asia. Rather, I introduce some leads for research
   on the basis of several manuscripts. A first issue is that of chronology
   and geography: terminus a quo, terminus ad quem, and the geographical
   extent of the book's production and circulation should be revised. A
   second question regards the circuits of circulation: manuscript designs
   and illustrations reveal influences from various regions and an
   evolution in uses. A third lead consists in investigating the education:
   Sufi training and Qur'anic institutions such as Dala'il-khanas played an
   important role, while Persian interlinear translations, reading notes in
   Chaghatay Turkish, and commentaries (sharks) suggest a complex reception
   process.},

Title = {How to set up a transdisciplinary research project in Central Asia:
   description and evaluation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {697-711},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {While there has been significant progress regarding the research mode
   transdisciplinary research (TDR) on a theoretical level, case studies
   describing specific TDR processes and the applied methods are rare. The
   aim of this paper is to describe how the first phase (Phase A) of a TDR
   project can be carried out in practice and to evaluate its
   accomplishments and effectiveness. We describe and evaluate Phase A of a
   TDR project that is concerned with tipping points of riparian forests in
   Central Asia. We used a TDR framework with objectives for Phase A and
   selected a sequence of methods for transdisciplinary knowledge
   integration. Semi-structured expert interviews for eliciting problem
   perceptions prepared for two transdisciplinary workshops, in which
   perception graphs, interest-influence diagrams and stakeholder network
   analyses were applied in addition to discussions in the plenary and in
   break-out groups. Scientists and stakeholders achieved to jointly frame
   the real-world problem, formulate research objectives, design a
   framework for knowledge integration, build a TDR team and decide on
   specific research activities for the main project phase. TDR context,
   process and products were judged by workshop participants positively,
   with average ratings above 3 on a scale from 0 (worst) to 4 (best).
   Strengths of our particular TDR approach during Phase A were the direct
   contact (interviews and two workshops) with potential TDR participants
   and the ability to allocate sufficient time and money to Phase A due to
   thefunded project pre-phase of 1 year. TDR in countries foreign to the
   scientists, as in our study, is hampered by language barriers as well as
   by a lack of familiarity with local conditions, in particular regarding
   stakeholder interrelations that cannot be simply overcome by a
   stakeholder analysis. We believe that the presented approach for setting
   up a TDR project can serve as a good basis for the design of other
   projects.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {476-490},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper uses firm-level data to investigate the effects of monetary
   uncertainty and political instability on the extensive and intensive
   margins of trade (exports and imports) in Eastern Europe and Central
   Asia. The former is related to exchange rate volatility, currency
   regimes and internal hedging, whereas the latter is related to the
   political regime in question. We consider 26 countries, most of them
   small, with poorly-developed financial markets, and in which exchange
   rate fluctuations and political instability are relatively high. The
   main results are threefold. First, we find a robust negative effect of
   exchange rate volatility on firms' probability of exporting (extensive
   margin) and on their export intensity (intensive margin). Second, we
   find a significant positive impact of binding currency agreements in the
   form of euro or ERM II membership, mainly on the extensive margin of
   trade. Moreover, we show that being party to those agreements allows
   firms to engage in international trade with a lower degree of internal
   hedging. Third, we make the case that political stability is related to
   an increase in exports. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Background Although burnout levels in oncologists are likely high, its
   predictors remain poorly understood.
   Aims This study was aimed to verify the prevalence of occupational
   burnout in oncology doctors and nurses in the major cancer centre in
   Kazakhstan and to elucidate its predictors to plan future prevention
   activities.
   Methods In the leading tertiary-level cancer centre in Kazakhstan, we
   recruited 256 subjects (67\% doctors and 33\% nurses, 62\% women, median
   age 37.5 {[}interquartile range 15] years) and offered them Maslach
   Burnout Inventory to quantify emotional exhaustion (EE),
   depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). Demographics,
   fatigue, health-related quality of life with SF-8 and lifestyle were
   tested as predictors of burnout in multivariate logistic regression
   models.
   Results Number of subjects with high EE was 121 (47\%), high DP was 161
   (63\%) and high PA was 152 (59\%). Fatigue, worse mental component score
   (MCS), being single and not exercising regularly predicted more burnout
   in EE. Fatigue, worse physical component score (PCS) and worse MCS
   predicted more burnout in DP. Finally, more burnout in PA was
   independently associated with fatigue, worse PCS, being married or
   divorced and having a university or academic degree.
   Conclusions The prevalence of occupational burnout in oncologists was
   high, necessitating early burnout prevention programmes, addressing,
   among other, fatigue reduction and regular exercise.},

Abstract = {This article challenges existing interpretations of Central Asia as a
   geographical entity. Adopting a history of technology approach to
   defining and analytically `constructing' Central Asia as a region, it
   scrutinizes the ways the region has been materially created over the
   years through four types of large technical systems (infrastructures):
   waterways, railways, electricity grids and natural gas pipelines. This
   process, which is traced over a period of 150 years, can be thought of
   as Central Asia's `hidden integration' (and `hidden fragmentation'). The
   article maps the processes through which different parts of the region
   have become technically interlinked through the four systems, and
   Central Asia's resulting `network geography'. It also studies the
   historical tensions, as they evolved over time, between
   `system-builders' and `border-builders'.},

Title = {Irrigation expansion and dynamics of desertification in the Circum-Aral
   region of Central Asia},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the causes and dynamics of
   desertification in one of the world's worst disaster areas, the Aral Sea
   region. During the 1960s, a large-scale irrigation campaign aimed at
   achieving independence in cotton production was launched in soviet
   Central Asia. From 1960, ever-increasing water withdrawal from the two
   inflowing rivers-the Amudarya and Syrdarya-has resulted in the dramatic
   decline of the level, area and volume of the sea. Desiccation was
   accompanied by the development and further acceleration of various
   desertification processes. The study reveals that, for different
   reasons, the predominant, direction and trends of desertification have
   been changing during each of the four identified periods from 1961 to
   1995. The main desertification processes recorded in the Circum-Aral
   region ('Priaraliye' in Russian) were a decline in the groundwater
   level, increased mineralization and chemical pollution of watercourses,
   soil salinization, the spread of xerophytic and halophytic vegetation,
   and deflation and aeolian accumulation, with the development of salt
   storms. Recent improvements in the situation are also discussed, along
   with their causes. Zonation of Priaraliye is carried out and an outlook
   for the future is given. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Title = {Gender Stereotypes and Family Decision-Making: Comparative Study of
   Central Europe and Central Asia},
Journal = {CENTRAL EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {61-84},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Purpose: The article aims to examine the impact of women's
   decision-making power in families on their gender stereotypes about
   business executives in the promising but insufficiently explored regions
   of Central Europe (CE) and Central Asia (CA).
   Methodology: The study utilized multiple linear regression and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients to analyze survey data (No=6,869)
   from Central European (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia)
   and Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and
   Uzbekistan).
   Findings: Central Asian women demonstrated stronger gender stereotypes
   about business executives compared to the Central European sample.
   Equally shared power in decision-making with a partner has a positive
   impact on weakening women's gender stereotypes about top managers. Men's
   unilateral decision-making correlates with their spouses' higher gender
   bias, whereas independent women's decisions do not reveal a relationship
   with their gender stereotypes.
   Research limitations: The study does not control respondents' marital
   and mother's status and excludes one of the Central Asian states, namely
   Turkmenistan.
   Research implications: Policymakers can use the present findings to
   forecast how familialist policies reproduce gender stereotypes and
   inhibit gender equality. The research complements the specificity of the
   vicious cycle linking gender roles and stereotypes in the context of CE
   and CA and expands the ``family cage{''} phenomenon.
   Originality/value: First massive research on gender stereotypes about
   business executives embracing the Visegrad Group and four Central Asian
   states. The study discovers the internal aspect of family impact on
   women's views of top managers that has been neglected before.},

Title = {Recalibrating EU Foreign Policy Vis-a-vis Central Asia: Towards
   Principled Pragmatism and Resilience},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Abstract = {With China and Russia acting more assertively vis-a-vis Central Asia,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have
   gradually moved to the core of contemporary Eurasian geopolitics -
   albeit to varying degrees. The European Union (EU) has purposefully
   sought to promote its norms and values in the region for quite some time
   in the past. However, considering the ongoing Western ``polycrisis{''}
   exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic most recently, our paper
   investigates how the EU has been recalibrating its relationship towards
   Central Asia - within the timespan of its two EU Central Asia
   Strategies, dating from 2007 and 2019, respectively. We argue that the
   reformulation of EU policy towards Central Asia is pragmatically taking
   its lead from the growing constraints of EU foreign policy as well as
   Chinese and Russian intervention in the region; it is, in the end,
   geographical proximity that continues to shape geopolitics in Central
   Asia.},

Abstract = {To fight coronavirus disease 2019, non-pharmaceutical interventions were
   adopted all over the world. Non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI)
   effectiveness also depends on governments' capacity to implement sound
   policies. Stay-at-home orders are binding measures that can raise
   serious concerns among the population. The perceived quality and
   effective need for these measures are therefore crucial for the
   willingness of the citizens to accept NPIs. This study investigates the
   relationship between the efficacy of NPIs and governance quality in
   Central Asia. Results suggest that overall governance quality matters
   and that in this relationship regulatory quality is more important than
   rule of law, which matters more than government effectiveness.},

Abstract = {This article surveys research on regimes and states in Central Asia and
   assesses its contribution to Political Science, specifically the
   subfield of comparative politics. It discusses three areas in which
   research on the region has been influenced by and, in turn, fruitfully
   shaped the comparative political analysis of state and regime: a turn
   from macro- to micro-level topics; innovations in research design; and
   the embrace of interdisciplinarity. It then addresses the challenges
   confronting scholars of the region, including uneven theoretical
   contributions to comparative politics and impediments in the feasibility
   of field research. It identifies several lively debates in comparative
   politics to which Central Asianists have the potential to contribute
   important insights. It concludes that the study of states and regimes in
   Central Asia has greatly enriched some debates in comparative politics
   (and vice versa), but declining pools of funding, the politicization of
   academic research, and unequal access to institutional resources among
   local and Western scholars threaten to diminish the field's
   contributions in the coming years.},

Booktitle = {ECONOMICS OF NATURAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {133-146},
Abstract = {The three Trans-Caucasian states Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan are
   unique among the former Soviet republics in having accomplished a
   sweeping transition from collective to individual agriculture. Not all
   the agricultural land resources have been privatized, and yet it is the
   individual sector that generates practically the entire agricultural
   output in these countries. This chapter reviews the extent of transition
   from collective to individual farming, discusses the different
   approaches to privatization and individualization in the three
   countries, and examines the difficulties associated with the fragmented
   farm structure. To reap the full benefits of individualization, the
   Trans-Caucasian countries should aim to increase the level of
   commercialization of their smallholder farms. The institutional tools
   necessary for achieving this aim include development of land markets,
   emphasis on rural infrastructure and farm support services, as well as
   creation of off-farm job opportunities for the rural population.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of population
   and language for China's Central Asian policy through soft power
   resources. This article will evaluate the steps China has taken since
   the disintegration of the USSR to remove the perception of threat felt
   by the peoples of the region. We will argue that China is trying to turn
   its population, which is seen as the biggest threat it poses, into an
   advantage for itself. Moreover, it will be pointed out that China is
   actively using its spiritual heritage to eliminate these negative
   perceptions and in this regard the objectives of Confucius schools will
   be assessed. The study will elaborate on the fact that China is using
   these schools and its population as important tools in expanding its
   area of influence in regional and international platforms. As a result
   of the study, it was revealed that although the soft power of China,
   which is popular in academic circles and with officials, was sometimes
   successful in practice, there were certain limitations in its population
   and language policies.},

   reconceptualizations of religious self-understanding in post-Soviet
   Tajikistan. Oral historical narratives and related bodies of printed
   literature associated with the lives and exploits of pre-Soviet
   exemplars have enabled new religious practices and helped form the basis
   of new post-Soviet religious identification practices. Narrators use
   historical narrative to create intertextual relationships between newly
   fashioned narratives and traditional paradigms of saintly and political
   power. Intertextual relationships lend legitimacy to contemporary
   devotion and allow for unique configurations of post-Soviet cultural
   continuity by establishing discursive connections between the pre-Soviet
   and post-Soviet religious environments. Oral historical narrative and
   its accompanying patterns of cultural continuity are central to the
   post-Soviet devotional project in Tajikistan.},

   education attainment has a strong positive impact on labor market
   activity and getting a formal sector job. Early family formation drives
   young women into inactivity, but it does not limit the chances of
   getting access to the formal sector. The chances of getting a formal
   sector job are positively influenced by the social resources of parents
   in Georgia and Tajikistan and by parents' economic resources in
   Azerbaijan and Georgia. Evidence about the role of economic need and of
   traditionalism for women's labor market participation is mixed.},

Abstract = {In the 1920s and 1930s, thousands of Americans traveled to the Soviet
   Union to help build the first socialist country in the world. American
   experts in the Soviet Union offered general scientific and technical
   advice that was grounded in a seemingly apolitical transnational
   ideology. And yet development work is inherently political. Using
   published and unpublished sources from archives and libraries in the
   United States and the former Soviet Union, this article looks at one
   particular case of American technical assistance-assistance to Soviet
   irrigation and cotton-growing schemes in Uzbekistan-to explore the
   little-known story of American participation in the perpetuation of
   Russia's colonial relationship with its Central Asian borderland. By
   privileging Russian dreams of landscape transformation in Turkestan over
   local uses of the environment, American experts in the region helped to
   ensure Central Asians' dependence on cotton cultivation while assisting
   in a process of environmental degradation that continues to this day.},

Abstract = {Almost twenty five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia
   and several Central Asian republics appear to be converging on what may
   be termed a `hierarchic party system', characterised by controlled and
   unequal competition between parties. Addressing the juncture between
   international politics and party politics, this article explores this
   convergence and considers Russian authoritarian norm diffusion as a
   possible explanation. This article argues that although Russia continues
   to build significant party-based linkage in Central Asia, similarities
   between party systems are the result of complex, multidirectional norm
   diffusion, as regimes look to liberalise or close their respective
   political systems. (c) 2015 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {We know surprisingly little about the impact of democratic decline in
   the EU on foreign policy and on democracy promotion efforts in
   particular. We examine qualitative and quantitative changes in aid
   allocation for democracy promotion alongside declining levels of
   democracy in the EU and its members. Focusing on decision-makers'
   perspectives, we explain these changes with strategic and constructivist
   approaches. We analyse multilateral and bilateral aid flows from the EU
   and its members to Central Asia with data from OECD and IATI from 2000
   to 2018. We identify quantitative changes in aid promoting democracy in
   Central Asia, which can be partially attributed to the donors'
   increasing challenges for democracy at home. While the overall aid
   levels remained stable, we also identify qualitative shifts in
   allocation patterns favouring government institutions rather than civil
   society organisations. Our findings address the impact of democratic
   decline on foreign policy towards non-democratic states outside the
   European neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {Youth idleness is a significant problem in many countries, including in
   Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) where it has rarely been studied.
   Labour market and education policies need to be based on a strong
   knowledge base on the Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET)
   population. This paper uses micro-level data from the early 2000s
   through 2011 to fill knowledge gaps. NEET rates for different age
   intervals, gender and educational attainment are investigated for the
   ECA region and countries within. We find that the NEET rate in ECA was
   declining prior to the 2009 crisis and increased afterwards, with a more
   pronounced impact on males. Our findings reveal considerable
   heterogeneity across countries likely due to varying demographics,
   labour market conditions and education policies. Policies on idle youths
   in this region need to be tailored to varying national situations. This
   paper also suggests pathways for future research.},

   Central Asia},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {707-732},

Abstract = {This article investigates the determinants of social capital by
   analyzing an original survey of post-Soviet Central Asia. It tests
   hypotheses derived from two related questions: whether networks, norms,
   and trust are empirically related and the extent to which four
   factors-culture, regime type, perceptions of government responsiveness,
   and development interventions-predict levels of social capital. The
   results show that trust and norms diverge from networking. Interaction
   is higher under less repressive regimes and is further increased by
   development interventions; trust and norms are higher under conditions
   of greater repression. Culture does not affect any indicators of social
   capital, but perceptions of responsiveness correlate with higher levels
   of trust. As such, disaggregating social capital is a promising new
   direction for research. Scholars should investigate why the components
   of social capital sometimes correlate but at other times diverge, and
   they should consider the possibility of distinct causal mechanisms in
   their development.},

Title = {The impact of migration and remittances on labor supply in Tajikistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Remittances from labor migrants abroad have become the largest component
   of financial flows to developing countries. While they are an important
   source of foreign currency for low-income countries, the impact of
   outmigration and remittances on the economic development of the sending
   country is ambiguous. To narrow this knowledge gap, this paper examines
   their impact on the domestic labor market, using the case of Tajikistan
   - a labor migrant contributor and remittance dependent country in
   Central Asia. Specifically, we estimate the impact of international
   migration and receipt of remittances on the labor supply decisions and
   employment of the family members left behind. To ensure rigorous
   inferences, we apply a control function approach using unique
   high-frequency household panel data. Our method enables us to correctly
   address the simultaneity of migration/ remittance and labor supply
   decisions of the left-behind members. Our main estimates are that
   sending migrants reduces the labor supply of the left-behind members by
   5.4 percentage points, and that receiving remittances reduces it by 10.2
   percentage points, respectively. These findings suggest that the
   reservation wage effect of having a migrant member and receiving
   remittances is large and surpasses other positive effects they might
   have.},

Abstract = {One of the criteria for the national economy growth of Kazakhstan
   Republic is its dynamic integration with national economies of the
   developed countries. Growth and merger of national companies at the
   macro and micro level is one of the priorities for the economy of each
   state including our country. Today in the Republic of Kazakhstan in the
   age of globalization, more than ever we need a system of complex
   measures in financial and trade sectors for its sustained development.
   Te article analyzes the situation of the competitiveness of the national
   economy of Kazakhstan. This research was aimed at studying the
   theoretical and methodological approaches for a development of
   competitive national economy in the context of globalization as well as
   developing practical recommendations for further economy development,
   which allowed to make several conclusions and recommendations arising
   from the aims and objectives set by the author. In the first part of
   this article, perspectives of national competitiveness are analyzed. In
   the second part of the article methodology of international
   competitiveness measurement is presented. In the third part of the
   article the analysis of Republic of Kazakhstan competitiveness is done.
   The results showed that there are many controversies in competitiveness
   definition and measurement. One of the examples is evolution of
   Kazakhstan's competitiveness in 2010 due to some activities by IMF and
   WEF. Though the measurements include many similar factors of
   competitiveness, the main competitive advantage of Kazakhstan is a huge
   reserve of mineral resources and stable macroeconomic situation. The
   main weaknesses are low innovation capability and high corruption rate.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {China has traditionally had close relations with Central Asia for quite
   a long time. The main reasons for this are probably their social,
   cultural, and demographic bonds, as well as geographical proximity,
   providing China with a different status in Central Asia from those of
   the other regions in the world. These bonds have also been strengthened
   by the ancient Silk Road, beginning in China and passing through Central
   Asia and Iran towards Europe. Cultural relations, in general, and
   China's attempt to expand its means of soft power in the region, in
   particular, have been a significant aspect of the ties between China and
   the Central Asian countries. It has drawn attention, especially over the
   recent decade, and has manifested in various forms. By focussing on the
   dimension of relations between China and the Central Asian countries,
   this article addresses the question of what does China try to achieve by
   expanding its soft power in Central Asia? The article argues that China
   has focussed on the expansion of its soft power and the consolidation of
   cultural ties with the Central Asian countries to expand its influence
   in the region and, eventually, to rise as a new centre of power in the
   international system. Following a conceptual discussion on the
   definition of soft power, the article analyses the status of soft power
   in China's foreign policy and then, the representations of China's soft
   power in Central Asia. Finally, the essay discusses the effects of the
   soft power factor on the expansion of Chinese influence in the region.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that, rather than constituting a new model for
   Central Asian international relations, the SREB's real strategic value
   for China is as an organizational concept and as an influence
   multiplier. In recasting its Central Asian bilateral relations as part
   of the SREB engagement model, Beijing has overlaid a strategic-level
   concept to its otherwise disparate patterns of engagement. In so doing,
   the Xi administration has consolidated its multiple lines of efforts and
   the diverse Chinese-based actorsboth state and privateinto a grand
   narrative: one that serves the strategic purpose of integration. The Xi
   administration has used (and is using) this integration to expand its
   influence throughout the Central Asian region, both through its
   bilateral relations and through a SREB-resulting network of Central
   Asian states. In particular, one sees regular instances within China's
   SREB engagement where the Xi administration uses the initiative to
   reconstitute regional states' development priorities, interests and
   relations in ways that benefit China's overall strategic interests.},

Abstract = {Was the destruction of Sufi and Alid saint shrines as a rite of conquest
   in Iran and Central Asia a phenomenon comparable to the desecration of
   temples in war in India? With this question in mind, this essay examines
   the changing nature of Islamic kingship in premodern Iran and Central
   Asia and compares it to developments in Indic kingship. It begins with
   the thesis that the decline of the caliphate and the rise of Muslim
   saints and shrines in thirteenth-century Iran and Central Asia led to a
   new form of shrine-centered sovereignty practiced by the rulers of these
   regions. This development, in turn, gave rise to a notable pattern in
   which Muslim kings threatened or attacked the shrines of their enemies'
   patron saints in times of war. A focus on this ritual violence, which
   remains neglected in the studies of Islamic iconoclasm and jihad,
   reveals how the protocols of violence and accommodation that governed
   these Muslim milieus became analogous to those enacted by Indic kings
   who also sacked temples of rival sovereigns in times of war. With the
   spread of Muslim shrines and the related belief that the real sovereign
   was not the caliph but the enshrined saint, Islam and Hinduism developed
   comparable grammars of gifting and looting. This argument allows for a
   new, transcultural perspective to examine the premodern history of
   India, Iran, and Central Asia, connected by the rise of Muslim saints
   and their shrines.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the legal and organizational mechanisms for
   ensuring the commercialization of intellectual property in the Republic
   of Kazakhstan. Authors analyzed the factors, infrastructure and
   institutions of commercialization, assessed the activities of subjects
   of commercialization The activity of enterprises in obtaining security
   documents for intellectual property was analyzed. The types of
   intellectual property that occupy the greatest share in the structure of
   issued security documents are identified. An assessment of the licensing
   activities dynamics related to innovation is given. The analysis of
   innovative activity of enterprises in Kazakhstan was carried out and the
   main trends of its dynamics were identified. Authors proposed measures
   to stimulate the commercialization of the intellectual development of
   Kazakhstan based on the studied foreign experience. The authors suggest
   that the greatest potential for stimulating the commercialization of
   intellectual property results is the development of venture capital
   financing. The most effective way is the adoption and implementation of
   the state program for the development of venture capital investment,
   because the state will be able to act as a guarantor of reliability. In
   addition, the authors proposed the use of venture financing methods
   tested in international practice, in which investments are made in
   stages to reduce risks.},

Abstract = {This study examines the developments in post-Soviet Uzbekistan in the
   field of state building. With the dissolution of USSR, newly independent
   states struggled to function as independent nation-states since the
   transition efforts from Communism to post-Communism created an uncharted
   area for the post-Soviet societies. Transition studies gained widespread
   attention with the democratization of Latin America and Southern Europe.
   However, it became evident that current transition literature which
   solely focuses on democratization and marketization lacks the
   explanatory power on transition process of post-Soviet states due to the
   Soviet legacy which left its marks not only in terms of democracy and
   economy but also on national-identity and religious affairs. Therefore,
   it is argued that a quadruple transition model which focuses on
   democratization, marketization, stateness and nationality is more
   appropriate to analyze the developments in post-Soviet states. In
   Uzbekistan, transition process was operated by Islam Karimov until 2016.
   Contrary to some other Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan enjoyed a
   more stable transition process mostly due to Karimov's authoritarian
   rule. However, after more than two decades, it is difficult to consider
   Uzbekistan neither as a full democracy nor as a market economy.
   Moreover, the struggle between so-called radical Islamist groups and the
   government poses serious threats to the stability of the country. Lately
   Shavkat Mirziyoyev's presidency following the death of Karimov created a
   more fertile ground for further democratization of Uzbekistan.
   Considering these developments, this study evaluates state-building
   policies of Uzbekistan in five topics regarding nation-building,
   democratization, marketization, religion and foreign affairs. It is
   argued that despite relative stability and progress, Uzbekistan is far
   from being an example of successful transition.},

Abstract = {Construction of Turkmenistan's East-West (EW) gas pipeline was completed
   in December 2015 when signs of the country's severe economic decline
   were becoming increasingly evident. This paper examines whether the EW
   pipeline can play any role in reversing this decline. To do this, it
   analyzes the feasibility of the four possible export options for
   Turkmenistan to utilize the pipeline: west, south, north, and east. This
   analysis demonstrates each option's infeasibility and associated
   problems. Based on this analysis, the paper concludes that the EW
   pipeline will be severely underutilized and thus contribute little to
   reversing Turkmenistan's economic decline.},

   Kyrgyz Republic shows that social media can facilitate an effective
   organization and expression of ideas in a constrained media system.
   Specifically, online users were able to collectively and successfully
   speak their minds when the country's lawmakers planned costly projects,
   ultimately causing these plans to be dropped. Also social media users
   facilitated spreading information about the abuses of power and
   government incompetence in the 2010 and in 2005 revolutions, causing
   presidents flee the country in both cases. These findings suggest that
   the internet can facilitate a broad and effective civic and political
   engagement. The implications of these findings in this media restricted
   context are discussed in relation to collective action theory.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of job
   satisfaction among employees in the telecommunications company in
   Uzbekistan and assess the effects of demographic and work-related
   variables on job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A survey
   questionnaire method was used to obtain the data from 403 employees
   working in the telecommunications company in Uzbekistan. The data were
   collected using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire short-form.
   Findings The results of the study indicated a significant effect of age
   and tenure on the job satisfaction. Age was found to be positively
   associated with the job satisfaction and intention to stay. The older
   employees are more likely to be satisfied and stay with the current
   company for the next 5 years. The tenure was also found to be positively
   correlated with the overall job satisfaction and intrinsic job
   satisfaction. It also has been revealed that male employees are less
   likely than female employees to stay in the company for the next 5 years
   ceteris paribus. According to the survey results, there was no
   significant impact of education level, gender, marital status or job
   field on the job satisfaction of the employees. Originality/value The
   results of the study demonstrate interesting job satisfaction findings
   of employees working in the telecommunications company in Uzbekistan,
   which can draw attention of the senior management and human resource
   departments to increase the level of job satisfaction levels among
   employees and start implementing the job satisfaction measures within
   the companies in Uzbekistan in order to create effective human resource
   management systems and retain qualified employees.},

Abstract = {This article advances a straightforward argument: a complete analysis of
   land reform processes in Central Asia needs to account for gender
   dynamics. More explicitly, it argues that alongside the feminization of
   agriculture, customary gender norms restricting female economic
   opportunities and property acquisition represent a structural advantage
   for local elites interested in hindering or delaying the process of farm
   individualization in Tajikistan. After overviewing the gap between
   female legal rights to agricultural land and the actualization of these
   rights in four Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan
   and Uzbekistan) the article narrows its focus to Tajikistan. After
   regression analyses reveal that gendered information gaps are
   insufficient to account for gaps in the registration of farmland, the
   study presents qualitative data examining the relationship between
   female-headed households and the slow pace of agrarian change in
   Tajikistan.},

Title = {Critical reflection on the extractive industries transparency initiative

Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {154},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to shed light on the implementation of
   anti-corruption efforts in extractive industries. Through the case study
   of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in
   Kyrgyzstan, the article aims to capture how the transparency norm is
   enacted in a development and `resource cursed' context. Building on the
   literature on resource governance and anti-corruption and on fieldwork
   conducted in Kyrgyzstan, this article discusses the implementation of
   EITI at national and subnational levels, as well as, community
   discourses and practices around transparent resource governance. It
   attempts to explain how anti-corruption initiatives function in
   authoritarian settings and why they fail to deliver the promised
   outcomes. The study highlights the incongruence between normative claims
   underlying global anti-corruption standards and actual policy and
   community practices on the ground. It argues that the implementation and
   outcomes of global anti-corruption interventions such as the EITI are
   conditioned by the local domestic context. The article stresses the need
   for scholars and policymakers to examine how transparency is articulated
   and implemented at national and subnational levels. (c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Kazakhstan became a petro-state in the 1990s, after signing important
   oil production agreements with several transnational companies. In
   recent years, Kazakhstan's government has imposed the revision of former
   agreements on these corporations. This article contends that said
   revision has allowed the national players, government and the state oil
   company, to extend rent-seeking, but that the changes have not been deep
   enough to attain national oil empowerment. This means that national
   players do not control the oil cycle - from upstream to export trade -
   and are unable to secure continued expansion in the oil sector. Both key
   issues remain in the hands of the foreign companies, although their
   prominence has diversified following the entry of large Chinese and
   Russian companies. (C) 2012 The Regents of the University of California.

Abstract = {Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Kazakhstan are all major
   destinations for labour migrants from rural areas of southern
   Kyrgyzstan. Along with searching for better income, younger men and
   women also migrate for educational purposes; children and elderly people
   stay behind. While older migrants often regard this separation from
   their families as temporary, younger people start to put down roots in
   places other than their homes and this has long-term consequences for
   development in rural areas. The paper therefore looks into families'
   multi-local settings and why young migrants fail to return home. It also
   considers the potential impact on rural development including remittance
   dependency, an increasing shortage of qualified labour and new
   conditions of social care. The paper concludes with an assessment of the
   policy implications.},

Abstract = {The horse has a strong cultural and historical importance in Kyrgyzstan.
   With a mountainous topography, the rural areas of this Central Asian
   country are best accessed by horse. Among all the tourism experiences
   Kyrgyzstan can offer, horse trekking has become one of the most popular.
   The article discusses horse-human relations in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan.
   The article will show how the Kyrgyz horse is enacted in multiple
   discourses and practices related to tourism, some of which converge,
   while others are in conflict. The article is supported by a political
   ecology approach, holding that nature is socially and politically
   constructed, as well as ANT/post-humanism approaches to tourism studies,
   which bring attention to non-human agency. We find that the multiple
   enactments of the Kyrgyz horse, the brand, the battle horse, the breed,
   the beshbarmak, and the best friend, derive from the horse's multiple
   agencies, which give the horse its important position in Kyrgyz culture
   and society. However, the branding of the Kyrgyz horse as a `unique'
   selling point in tourism development fails to acknowledge the complex
   human-animal relation by down-playing horse husbandry practices that are
   in conflict with tourism.},

   boundary behaves as a `presence absence' whose relevance fluctuates and
   whose momentary features remain unpredictable, as we demonstrate by
   focusing on transgressive mixed marriages between Russian and Kyrgyz
   villagers.},

Abstract = {The power characteristics of the constructed and operated hydroelectric
   power plants in Kazakhstan are given. It is shown that the share of
   electricity generated at hydropower plants in the total volume of

   of 80-85\% of the research work performed are limited to the study of
   the parameters of prototypes or prototypes of improved and new HPP
   designs.
   Existing promising domestic developments can serve as basic solutions
   for mastering them in production. It has been proposed to update the
   previously developed ``Development Schemes for Small Hydroelectric Power
   Stations in Kazakhstan{''} on the basis of a feasibility study and an

Abstract = {For many decades, Uzbekistan has been one of the largest cotton
   producers in the world. The irrigation water needed for these high
   production levels has been delivered by the massive diversion of the Amu
   Darya and Syr Darya rivers, which naturally flowed into the Aral Sea.
   This diversion for agriculture was the main cause of the rapid decline
   of the Aral Sea, which is at only 10\% of its original size today. The
   traditional method of irrigation, which relies on simple open canal
   systems, is highly inefficient for managing the region's critical and
   limited water resource. It has been qualitatively estimated, for
   example, that irrigation water lost to evaporation and system
   inefficiencies is quite large. With the future availability of water at
   risk for agriculture in Central Asia, primarily due to the loss of
   glacial volume from global warming, along with declines in seasonal
   snowpack, it is clear that new approaches to water management are
   needed. Any serious efforts to restore the Aral Sea and its ecological
   services would also reduce supplies of irrigation water for Uzbekistan.
   While regional conflict over water is unlikely, it must be considered
   since Uzbekistan is a downstream country among several that rely on the
   Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for most of their water supplies. To
   insure against these risks to cotton production and the underlying
   economy, better irrigation technologies are needed across Uzbekistan.
   However, these technologies can be quite expensive, especially given
   that water is still nearly free. In this case study we explore the use
   of real options analysis (ROA) to look for optimal investment strategies
   in efficient irrigation technologies in light of variable climate and
   policy uncertainties.},

   leaders who had never been closely tied to Islamic institutions, such as
   otins (women religious leaders) were not targeted for arrest and
   removal. Our respondents remembered times when it was difficult to
   engage in any practice of Islam publicly, but they emphasized that
   nonetheless, community members fulfilled the ritual that they deemed
   most essential: the funeral prayer.},

Abstract = {The traditional authority of Kyrgyz women operates within moral
   frameworks and through their roles as keepers of hearth and home, and
   has been recognized by the state for its important role in family life
   and in society. Women are responsible for the health of future
   generations, for the quality of children's education, and for
   safeguarding and passing on moral principles, which contribute to the
   formation of the traditional Kyrgyz family, and thus to the Kyrgyz
   nation. Kyrgyz ideas that women are keepers of hearth and home are
   exactly the ideas that allow women to build authority within the home
   and family. Not only do Kyrgyz women actually gain a great deal of power
   in their families over the course of their lives, but also this female
   power is foundational to the Kyrgyz sense of nation and sovereignty.
   Thus, what seems to be ``domestic{''} power is, in fact, power with very
   public connections and effects.},

Abstract = {This article examines the economic and social dynamics that underlay the
   anti-Soviet partisan (basmachi) warfare and violent
   anti-collectivization protests in late 1929 and early 1930. Based
   primarily on archival materials in Moscow, Bishkek, and Osh
   (Kyrgyzstan), the work first looks at Soviet policies in Central Asia in
   the five years before Stalin's Great Turn; these policies served as
   precipitants to the crises of 1929-1930 in southern Kyrgyzstan. Next,
   the article describes the geographic, social, and economic variety of
   southern Kyrgyzstan in the late 1920s; these factors shaped the nature,
   intensity, and goals of rural resistance, Finally, the article examines
   several cases of peasant protest in detail, demonstrating their causes,
   dynamics, and effects. The article finds that collectivization triggered
   the outbreaks of violence, but long-simmering tensions over Soviet
   policies on land reform, ``cottonization,{''} trade, social engineering,
   and religion served as preconditions to the resistance. Furthermore, the
   outbreaks were largely uncoordinated and occurred in response to the
   actions of specific officials. The basmachi, loosely affiliated
   partisans with no stake in a future Soviet order, occasionally used
   peasant unrest to their advantage, but they neither inspired it nor
   directed it. Ultimately, the state regained control by putting down mass
   resistance by force, isolating the basmachi, and offering incentives to
   sooth a restful rural population.},

Abstract = {Collectivization of agriculture in Uzbekistan demanded the efforts of

   moments, we find both the brutality of change imposed from above and a
   social transformation led by local Uzbek activists. We argue that Uzbek
   agitators allowed many dehqons to identify with this project to change
   rural land ownership, and that their offers of tangible benefits, such
   as advance payments for cotton crops and distribution of food, provided
   strong incentives for joining. Class rhetoric was important as activists
   divided the poor from the kulak and used threats of dekulakization, as
   well as incentives, to promote rapid collectivization.},

Abstract = {This article aims to understand the rise of Hizb ut-Tahrir in

   explores how theories of social movements can help explain the emergence
   of this group. Social movement theories focus on multiple aspects of the
   origins of collective action, including responses to structural strains,
   mobilisation of resources, responses to political opportunities and
   framing processes. Although most studies of social movements focus on
   one or another of these theories, they are employed here together in
   relation to the emergence of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Uzbekistan. Finally, the
   article suggests that the group's ideology can be understood as a
   powerful basis for collective action.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the country-specific understanding of
   Hajj, its experience and challenges between the pilgrims of Ghana and
   Uzbekistan. Design/methodology/approach Anchored on the theory of
   constructivism, this study explored and used the purposive sampling
   method in the context of qualitative research to select 97 Muslim
   pilgrims from Ghana and Uzbekistan of varying demographics for in-depth
   interviews. Findings Findings show that the philosophy of Hajj as the
   fifth pillar obligation set by Allah was common among the Muslim
   pilgrims of these two countries which support earlier literature.
   Interestingly, this study uncovered some distinctions in the
   construction of the understanding of Hajj; that is Ghanaian pilgrims
   have attached social status of respect and titles to Hajj in their
   societies. While Uzbekistan pilgrims are seen in their communities as
   spiritual role models that inspire others to live meaningful lives in
   the society. Research limitations/implications The conclusion and the
   outcome of this study cannot be generalized as to represent the whole
   population of Ghana and Uzbekistan due to qualitative approach.
   Practical implications This study revealed country-specific
   understanding and experience of Hajj that can be used by the
   policymakers and marketers to create better travel package.
   Originality/value The outcome of this study advanced a cross-cultural
   Hajj understanding which is important to policymakers, businesses and
   spiritual tourism practitioners to have a better insight into Hajj in
   contexts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we use Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of capitals and fields

   adopt these concepts for the study of land governance, in an attempt to
   gain new insights in post-socialist transition. By means of an in-depth
   study of land and water reform in two Uzbek villages, we reveal the
   intimate connections between access to water and access to land in the
   Uzbek rural economy, as well as the wide variety of strategies used by
   farmers to secure access to these resources. It is argued that the
   increased importance of the political field, in combination with its
   increased volatility and the dismantling of Soviet local governance, led
   to opacity in the conversion rates of capitals, to a bet on land as safe
   haven, and an ambiguous status of money.},

Title = {How marriages based on bride capture differ: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {579-592},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   A significant proportion of women in the Kyrgyz Republic marry via ala
   kachuu, generally translated as bride capture or kidnapping. Many regard
   this practice as harmless elopement or a tradition; others perceive it
   as a form of forced marriage.
   OBJECTIVE
   This paper contributes to the understanding of ala kachuu by exploring
   the extent to which couples in these marriages differ from those in
   arranged or love marriages.
   METHODS
   We use the 2013 wave of the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey to compute profile
   similarity indices for the personality of couples. We then regress
   marriage type on the profile similarity index, controlling for
   sociodemographic variables.
   RESULTS
   Couples in marriages resulting from bride capture are far less
   assortatively matched on personality traits than other couples,
   especially those who have only recently married.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This greater dissimilarity is consistent with ala kachuu being forced
   marriage rather than merely staged or ritualized elopement.
   CONTRIBUTION
   This paper provides a novel source of evidence on the possible
   nonconsensual nature of bride capture in Kyrgyzstan, adding further
   weight to those arguing that it is forced.},

Abstract = {Economic disparity between ethnic groups is sometimes supposed to be the
   main driver of ethnic conflict. Understanding the extent and the sources
   of such disparity is then important to help formulate policies that aim
   at avoiding further conflict. This paper analyzes economic disparity
   between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan. These groups were
   involved in violent clashes in the recent past. Using household survey
   data from 2005, we show that, in contrast to the public perception,
   Kyrgyz households have slightly higher expenditure than Uzbek households
   in urban areas and about the same level in rural areas. The gap in urban
   areas is mostly due to smaller households and higher education among the
   Kyrgyz. We also find that Uzbek households are better off than Kyrgyz
   households in terms of the value of housing property. We argue that the
   house value gap can be explained by the Uzbeks having larger houses,
   which are home to larger families and serve as a basis for running small
   businesses. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (4) (2014) 970-982.

Abstract = {In 1974, Anthropological Quarterly published a special issue on bride
   theft. Since then, considerable work has been published on the practice.
   Drawing on my fieldwork in the Kyrgyz Republic, I assess current
   understandings of the practice. I argue that although functionalist and
   symbolic approaches to kidnapping are still relevant, it is necessary to
   consider kidnapping in the context of intensifying discursive
   competition over marriage, gender roles, and authority. In my account,
   kidnapping is a practice that both supports and undermines existing
   systems of oppression. As such, it has become a powerful engine of
   social change.},

Abstract = {Can nondemocratic leaders initiate a crackdown against mass protesters
   and suffer little in the way of political-reputational costs? In
   conceptualizing a ``crackdown{''} as a government-orchestrated violent
   restriction of civil society involving the killing of civilians, this
   article analyzes how the use of force is perceived by ordinary citizens
   when their government represses a portion of the populace. In analyzing
   the findings of a 2016 survey that gauges contemporary attitudes toward
   the overthrow of presidents Askar Akaev (in 2005) and Kurmanbek Bakiev
   (in 2010), this article argues that Kyrgyzstanis evaluate the Bakiev
   administration more negatively than they do the Akaev administration
   because of the former's resort to forceful measures in attempting to
   quell mass protesters in April 2010. Such findings imply that
   nondemocratic leaders who employ force against mass protesters incur
   significant political-reputational costs, irrespective as to whether the
   wider public views the mass protests as legitimate or not.},

Abstract = {This study uses a Mincerian earnings function to estimate the effect of
   education and experience on the wages of women working in developed
   business and trade center of Bishkek, Kyrgyztan. It employs a robust
   median regression and M Regression to estimate the functions for both
   public and private sectors. The paper also estimates the function using
   a least squared regression for comparison. Findings/Originality: The
   results show that returns to education for women employees in the
   private sector are higher than that of in the public sector. In
   contrast, the returns to experience for women employees in the public
   sector are higher than those in the private sector. The study reveals
   that schooling has strong causal effects on wages. Therefore, the
   government should give sufficient priority to education. Every Som spent
   in quality education generates strong positive returns for the whole
   economy. So that Kyrgyz government should put more efforts to enable
   individuals staying longer in education.},

Journal = {SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {144},
Number = {1},
Pages = {337-378},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Income and hours worked are insufficient to measure job quality yet
   these domains dominate literature aimed at understanding its
   relationship with wellbeing. More so, literature considering job quality
   in any manner has an overwhelming tendency to look at advanced
   economies, despite decent work being a key policy aim of many agencies
   and organisations working in emerging countries. This article tests the
   validity of the concept of job quality as a determinant of welfare in
   the developing world by generating four six-component indices using
   bespoke and unique data collected in Kyrgyzstan. Cross-sectional
   analysis of the performance of these indices against ones comprising
   only income and hours worked show no relationship between job quality
   and wellbeing in the latter case but a strong and positive relationship
   in the former. Jointly, this shows both the importance of more suitably
   measuring job quality in all contexts and the importance of policy
   objectives that aim to stimulate better, as well as more, jobs in the
   developing world.},

Abstract = {The article studies the transformation of a Kyrgyz coal-mining village

   approaches with concepts borrowed from Actor Network Theory (ANT), I
   attempt to show how nature-based tourism development contributes to a
   reordering of nature in certain ways rather than others. Supported by my
   empirical material, I suggest that this reordering of nature makes
   certain realities emerge, while others submerge. However, while some
   orderings of natures appear to be representing reality, it does not
   necessarily rule out multiple understandings of how nature ``ought to
   look{''} or be used.},
